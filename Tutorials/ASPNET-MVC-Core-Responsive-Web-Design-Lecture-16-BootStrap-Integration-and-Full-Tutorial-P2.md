- [00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=230) inputs with our custom version input group attach labels and buttons to

- [00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=232) input group attach labels and buttons to your inputs for increased semantic value

- [00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=236) your inputs for increased semantic value floating labels create beautifully

- [00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=237) floating labels create beautifully simple form labels that float over your

- [00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=239) simple form labels that float over your input fields

- [00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=245) layout create inline horizontal or complex grid-based layouts with your

- [00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=247) complex grid-based layouts with your forms

- [00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=249) forms validation validates your forms with

- [00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=251) validation validates your forms with custom or native validation behaviors

- [00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=253) custom or native validation behaviors and styles

- [00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=254) and styles okay so

- [00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=260) overview bootstrap's form controls expand on our

- [00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=262) bootstrap's form controls expand on our rebooted form styles with classes

- [00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=265) rebooted form styles with classes use these classes to opt into their

- [00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=267) use these classes to opt into their customized displays for a more

- [00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=268) customized displays for a more consistent rendering across browsers and

- [00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=270) consistent rendering across browsers and devices

- [00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=273) devices be sure to use an appropriate type

- [00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=274) be sure to use an appropriate type attribute on all inputs example email

- [00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=277) attribute on all inputs example email for email address or number for

- [00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=279) for email address or number for numerical information to take advantage

- [00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=281) numerical information to take advantage of newer input controls like email

- [00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=283) of newer input controls like email verification number selection and more

- [00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=287) verification number selection and more here's a quick example to demonstrate

- [00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=289) here's a quick example to demonstrate bootstrap's form styles

- [00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=291) bootstrap's form styles keep reading for documentation on

- [00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=293) keep reading for documentation on required classes form layout and more

- [00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=296) required classes form layout and more okay you see that how clean it looks uh

- [00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=298) okay you see that how clean it looks uh now i will show you

- [00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=300) now i will show you uh the difference between a bootstrap

- [00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=303) uh the difference between a bootstrap and

- [00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=304) and non-bootstrap version

- [00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=307) non-bootstrap version so if you remember from the previous

- [00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=309) so if you remember from the previous lecture

- [00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=310) lecture we had a test html which was a

- [00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=313) we had a test html which was a [Music]

- [00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=314) [Music] static page

- [00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=316) static page to compare them they look actually

- [00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=320) to compare them they look actually we can index

- [00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=322) we can index html is here okay

- [00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=326) html is here okay okay let's run our application

- [00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=345) okay so you see uh the text box is taking pull space by default

- [00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=347) taking pull space by default uh it has some

- [00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=350) uh it has some let's say help

- [00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=353) let's say help uh form text here

- [00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=355) uh form text here one takes a as label as here as you see

- [00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=391) oh it is gone and it has some checkbox like this and

- [00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=394) and it has some checkbox like this and you see you can also click on this text

- [00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=397) you see you can also click on this text to check it as well

- [00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=399) to check it as well so it is checkbox type and it has class

- [00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=402) so it is checkbox type and it has class as check me out

- [00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=405) as check me out they are inside a form check

- [00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=408) they are inside a form check class and mb3

- [00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=411) class and mb3 is breakpoint related stuff okay so this

- [00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=414) is breakpoint related stuff okay so this is our form it is taking full space and

- [00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=419) is our form it is taking full space and this is the

- [00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=420) this is the form

- [00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=421) form text message

- [00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=423) text message and here you have checkbox and submit

- [00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=426) and here you have checkbox and submit and let's

- [00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=427) and let's see test html

- [00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=431) um it was

- [00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=433) it was i think it was inside static

- [00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=438) okay static pages here here

- [00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=441) static pages here here and you see this is the default part now

- [00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=444) and you see this is the default part now compare how they are looking differently

- [00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=447) compare how they are looking differently in both

- [00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=449) in both cases by the way if i don't want this to

- [00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=452) cases by the way if i don't want this to be

- [00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=453) be taking full spawn i can add a class as

- [00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=458) taking full spawn i can add a class as i think um

- [00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=474) maybe call 3 yeah let's try that so it should take only

- [00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=476) so it should take only 25 percent of the screen

- [00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=488) okay why did it generate an internal error

- [00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=494) okay this is interesting form class let's look from our uh database as you

- [00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=497) let's look from our uh database as you remember we were logging

- [00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=500) remember we were logging all of the

- [00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=502) all of the errors

- [00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=503) errors so let's open the

- [00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=506) so let's open the sequence

- [00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=586) you see evading computer is taking a lot of time if you don't have a

- [00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=588) of time if you don't have a fast computer then you will spend i say

- [00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=592) fast computer then you will spend i say waste a lot of time

- [00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=595) waste a lot of time when reading your program to run

- [00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=599) when reading your program to run okay

- [00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=606) so here we have pms and this is cool and from mvc

- [00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=610) and from mvc if your page is getting loaded okay now

- [00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=612) if your page is getting loaded okay now you see it is not taking full space it

- [00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=615) you see it is not taking full space it is taking only 25 percent uh and yeah

- [00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=618) is taking only 25 percent uh and yeah it's working and i can also take this

- [00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=621) it's working and i can also take this inside of

- [00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=628) a container so it will be centered

- [00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=631) so it will be centered i think that would be even better let me

- [00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=633) i think that would be even better let me test that

- [00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=635) test that so this container will be

- [00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=638) so this container will be like this

- [00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=640) like this i will remove this

- [00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=642) i will remove this i will add a div

- [00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=644) i will add a div here like this

- [00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=648) here like this okay and when i refresh the page

- [00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=652) okay and when i refresh the page let's see if it will give error again

- [00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=655) let's see if it will give error again i'm gonna select all from

- [00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=679) okay it is getting closer okay working now you see now it is also centered and

- [00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=682) now you see now it is also centered and yeah

- [00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=683) yeah taking on the tripo space

- [00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=686) taking on the tripo space and let's compare it with the static

- [00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=689) and let's compare it with the static test

- [00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=694) okay delete this one

- [00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=700) and yeah and you see the difference how it looks different let's see how it

- [00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=703) it looks different let's see how it looks on internal explorer as well

- [00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=706) looks on internal explorer as well so this is nintendo explorers

- [00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=709) so this is nintendo explorers and this is chrome

- [00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=712) and this is chrome seem like this

- [00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1055) we have password read only text here you see i cannot change it

- [00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1057) see i cannot change it uh so we read only it has added um

- [00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1063) uh so we read only it has added um you see plain text

- [00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1065) you see plain text extension to the class of the form

- [00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1067) extension to the class of the form control nothing else

- [00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1069) control nothing else and

- [00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1075) there is file input like this you see it will

- [00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1076) will open file selection

- [00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1079) open file selection multiple file input

- [00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1086) multiple file i can select multiple and then there is default file input

- [00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1089) and then there is default file input with default file input i can select on

- [00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1091) with default file input i can select on the single

- [00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1092) the single unit

- [00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1094) unit and disabled file inputs and small file

- [00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1097) and disabled file inputs and small file inputs small file input is just

- [00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1100) inputs small file input is just uh the input is small and there's large

- [00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1102) uh the input is small and there's large this is an important thing so let's add

- [00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1105) this is an important thing so let's add it to our

- [00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1107) it to our container here

- [00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1110) container here such as this one

- [00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1112) such as this one okay let's refresh it

- [00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1125) okay uh it will not represent yet oh i didn't edit to the test first

- [00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1129) oh i didn't edit to the test first so you see

- [00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1130) so you see they all look same and

- [00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1133) they all look same and really bad if you ask me by default so

- [00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1136) really bad if you ask me by default so let's add it to the

- [00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1138) let's add it to the index.html as well

- [00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1141) index.html as well cshtml actually

- [00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1143) cshtml actually and let's replace the page

- [00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1156) the files like this

- [00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1162) and yeah they are looking great and correct

- [00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1165) yeah they are looking great and correct so let's continue so let's also

- [00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1172) notice file inputs multiple

- [00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1174) file inputs multiple file inputs large small oil input

- [00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1179) file inputs large small oil input and what does there is there is color

- [00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1181) and what does there is there is color picker you see it's pretty useful

- [00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1184) picker you see it's pretty useful so let's copy and paste it as well

- [00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1189) so let's copy and paste it as well okay

- [00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1194) so let's add it here and

- [00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1196) let's add it here and on

- [00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1198) on this html as well here

- [00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1202) this html as well here okay let's refresh

- [00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1212) yeah color picker is working and how it looks

- [00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1215) and how it looks it is looking like this

- [00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1218) it is looking like this and

- [00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1226) there is the total lists so oh interesting i have never used this

- [00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1229) oh interesting i have never used this before

- [00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1231) before so when i type something they appear and

- [00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1233) so when i type something they appear and i can also use

- [00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1236) i can also use the arrow here as well so

- [00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1239) the arrow here as well so it is called as data list it has options

- [00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1245) it is called as data list it has options okay

- [00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1251) and color pickers and

- [00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1252) and data lists

- [00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1254) data lists basically it is using whatever available

- [00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1256) basically it is using whatever available in

- [00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1257) in regular browsers but they

- [00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1260) regular browsers but they it's the bootstrap makes them better

- [00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1264) it's the bootstrap makes them better uh looking okay

- [00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1267) uh looking okay and then the select options you see like

- [00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1269) and then the select options you see like this

- [00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1271) this and the sizing of select like this

- [00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1274) and the sizing of select like this there's multiple attributes selection

- [00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1276) there's multiple attributes selection like this

- [00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1278) like this there's disabled okay

- [00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1281) there's disabled okay um

- [00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1282) um yeah

- [00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1283) yeah select and

- [00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1286) select and sizing

- [00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1288) sizing of select

- [00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1291) of select and

- [00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1293) and multiple select with multiple attribute

- [00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1296) multiple select with multiple attribute here

- [00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1297) here so you see you just add multiple

- [00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1300) so you see you just add multiple to the

- [00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1307) uh to the select inside the select here so this is not the thing or

- [00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1310) so this is not the thing or a boot up this is the thing of the html

- [00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1313) a boot up this is the thing of the html uh you just add multiple to the

- [00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1319) actually you don't need even add anything to the

- [00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1321) anything to the it's class it is automatically getting

- [00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1323) it's class it is automatically getting it from multiple and there is the

- [00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1326) it from multiple and there is the label uh as the select as here

- [00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1330) label uh as the select as here okay and

- [00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1338) there's nothing important and then there is

- [00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1339) is checks and

- [00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1340) checks and radios like this

- [00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1348) and there is intermediate checkbox and there is disabled and there's radios

- [00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1359) okay i would like to test this which is in

- [00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1360) in bold

- [00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1362) bold cshtml and

- [00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1365) cshtml and test html

- [00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1369) test html compare the how they loop

- [00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1382) and let's see okay you see switch is not even working

- [00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1384) okay you see switch is not even working in

- [00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1386) in default so it is something that is done

- [00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1389) default so it is something that is done with a bootstrap

- [00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1391) with a bootstrap um

- [00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1393) um yeah

- [00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1394) yeah so let's add them

- [00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1400) okay checks

- [00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1403) checks and we have intermediate

- [00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1415) i see so this is a set with javascript and there is

- [00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1419) a set with javascript and there is disabled there is radios

- [00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1426) and there is switches so the switch is not even available in html

- [00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1437) okay and there is default stack it like this

- [00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1439) this and default radio there is inline you

- [00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1442) and default radio there is inline you see

- [00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1443) see still looking pretty good

- [00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1445) still looking pretty good yeah for inline we add just inline word

- [00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1449) yeah for inline we add just inline word to the end of the class you see form

- [00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1451) to the end of the class you see form check form check in line so they are

- [00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1455) check form check in line so they are [Music]

- [00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1456) [Music] um stack it you need to write both of

- [00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1461) um stack it you need to write both of them

- [00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1461) them there's check box and there is four

- [00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1464) there's check box and there is four label

- [00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1466) label okay

- [00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1467) okay this is a really good one i will add

- [00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1469) this is a really good one i will add this

- [00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1471) this to here

- [00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1478) let's see the difference between that in text html here

- [00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1487) okay so it is not looking good and working correctly and here

- [00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1490) working correctly and here yeah you do you know why we have these

- [00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1492) yeah you do you know why we have these borders because in the previous lecture

- [00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1494) borders because in the previous lecture we have added

- [00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1495) we have added borders to all of our divs

- [00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1500) borders to all of our divs s here

- [00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1501) s here which is under border class

- [00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1504) which is under border class that is why we have extra borders

- [00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1508) that is why we have extra borders okay working um

- [00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1516) in line here and there's without labels you can also

- [00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1518) and there's without labels you can also define them without labels and we have

- [00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1520) define them without labels and we have toggle buttons

- [00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1523) toggle buttons okay how does it work

- [00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1532) okay toggle is doing nothing oh

- [00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1535) toggle is doing nothing oh i see so now it is check it

- [00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1538) i see so now it is check it yeah i see

- [00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1542) okay but i wouldn't use this because it is

- [00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1544) but i wouldn't use this because it is pretty confusing

- [00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1549) okay toggle buttons and

- [00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1553) toggle buttons and usually toggle buttons alpine styles

- [00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1556) usually toggle buttons alpine styles like this

- [00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1557) like this oh this is better

- [00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1558) oh this is better you see when is it check it it it

- [00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1560) you see when is it check it it it changes the colors

- [00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1563) changes the colors yeah this is the better approach

- [00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1572) so let's add this inside our container and let's add it to the test html as

- [00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1575) and let's add it to the test html as well

- [00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1580) okay let's refresh okay it is working

- [00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1583) okay it is working yeah

- [00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1592) but it only allows check one of them or something let's see the code

- [00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1604) input class input type radio so when you set radio you can also only

- [00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1607) set radio you can also only check one of them like success or

- [00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1610) check one of them like success or dangers okay as you can see and this can

- [00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1614) dangers okay as you can see and this can be bought check it or not

- [00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1622) and radio buttons works with groups

- [00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1625) works with groups okay [Music]

- [00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1640) okay then there's range we use our custom range input so the

- [00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1642) we use our custom range input so the range is not something like this

- [00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1649) okay so i don't think this will i'm not sure

- [00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1651) so i don't think this will i'm not sure though yeah let's test it let's test if

- [00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1655) though yeah let's test it let's test if it is working with

- [00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1657) it is working with test html and

- [00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1660) test html and [Music]

- [00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1661) [Music] next html

- [00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1670) ranges is still working but it is looking like this and here

- [00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1673) looking like this and here okay it is looking like this much better

- [00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1676) okay it is looking like this much better actually i like it this blue color it is

- [00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1679) actually i like it this blue color it is not available in here maybe there is a

- [00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1681) not available in here maybe there is a clause for that

- [00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1686) oh you see now it has

- [00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1688) you see now it has five splits with min and max

- [00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1692) five splits with min and max yeah and then you can also set the step

- [00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1695) yeah and then you can also set the step like

- [00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1696) like it is 10 percent right now

- [00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1699) it is 10 percent right now yeah

- [00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1700) yeah so let's also add that range

- [00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1704) so let's also add that range unlock steps

- [00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1714) okay um

- [00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1715) um [Music]

- [00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1717) [Music] so something at example.com

- [00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1724) your validity url like this download like this

- [00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1726) download like this username server

- [00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1729) username server okay it works as input group and

- [00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1733) okay it works as input group and input group text

- [00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1740) id then there is inputs so they are becoming a group of inputs you see

- [00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1743) becoming a group of inputs you see so let me show you what does that mean i

- [00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1745) so let me show you what does that mean i will change its behavior

- [00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1748) will change its behavior with an example with

- [00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1750) with an example with copy paste so the first

- [00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1754) copy paste so the first part of input group i will remove the

- [00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1756) part of input group i will remove the input group class

- [00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1760) input group class here

- [00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1761) here let's see how it looks

- [00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1774) let's let's start by the way we were going to check the error so

- [00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1776) going to check the error so see if we had error rocks

- [00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1780) see if we had error rocks and here's

- [00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1783) and here's okay what is the error

- [00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1803) okay one or more compilation failures accurate

- [00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1809) is not what it is interesting

- [00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1815) so it says we have another i see since we have used add characters

- [00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1817) we have used add characters uh which is breaking our code

- [00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1821) uh which is breaking our code i just need to change them

- [00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1828) like this you know it should work

- [00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1841) by the way i think i know the reason of why

- [00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1842) why the computer were slower at the

- [00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1844) the computer were slower at the beginning because

- [00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1846) beginning because you see

- [00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1847) you see uh it did install some updates and it

- [00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1850) uh it did install some updates and it has slowed down the computer

- [00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1853) has slowed down the computer in the beginning

- [00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1855) in the beginning sorry about that

- [00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1857) sorry about that and then there's also wrapping

- [00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1859) and then there's also wrapping and

- [00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1860) and yeah what is the difference between

- [00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1862) yeah what is the difference between wrapping and

- [00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1863) wrapping and [Music]

- [00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1865) [Music] input group

- [00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1872) i think it is about lower resolution or something

- [00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1882) and there's check boxes and radios you see you can also

- [00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1884) see you can also uh

- [00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1885) uh input group them

- [00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1887) input group them and then you can have multiple inputs

- [00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1889) and then you can have multiple inputs like this

- [00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1890) like this yeah it is extremely useful

- [00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1894) yeah it is extremely useful there is multiple add-ons

- [00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1897) there is multiple add-ons modern add-ons like this

- [00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1904) for add-ons you just add modern outline secondary

- [00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1906) secondary and input yeah

- [00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1913) yeah buttons we dropped all this is really

- [00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1915) buttons we dropped all this is really cool

- [00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1916) cool so for buttons with block down

- [00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1919) so for buttons with block down we add butternut and secondary and drop

- [00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1921) we add butternut and secondary and drop down toggle to the bottom

- [00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1924) down toggle to the bottom and then we start as

- [00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1926) and then we start as an unordered list

- [00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1933) and you can even have a divider like this

- [00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1934) this and this is separated in here

- [00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1938) and this is separated in here and you can even have segmented buttons

- [00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1940) and you can even have segmented buttons like this

- [00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1946) achieving this is extremely hard

- [00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1947) hard when you don't use um

- [00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1950) when you don't use um bootstrap so let's compare it with

- [00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1958) static and bootstrap and let's see how they look

- [00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1980) oh it's taking a lot of time to recompile

- [00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1989) okay yeah they are working and let's see the

- [00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1992) yeah they are working and let's see the classical

- [00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1994) classical test

- [00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1995) test oh my god yeah as you can see they are

- [00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1997) oh my god yeah as you can see they are completely different

- [00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=1999) completely different not even anything related

- [00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=2002) not even anything related you see your so you see action toggle

- [00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=2004) you see your so you see action toggle drop down and you don't see anything

- [00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=2006) drop down and you don't see anything like that here there's action another

- [00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=2008) like that here there's action another action something else and separated link

- [00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=2010) action something else and separated link and they are being displayed like this

- [00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=2013) and they are being displayed like this there are two check boxes

- [00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=2016) there are two check boxes i mean input boxes there is actually a

- [00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=2018) i mean input boxes there is actually a toggle bro

- [00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=2019) toggle bro toggle

- [00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=2021) toggle so you see

- [00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=2022) so you see how different they are looking when you

- [00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=2025) how different they are looking when you don't use bootstrap

- [00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=2031) okay so inputs group is extremely important part of bootstrap because we

- [00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=2034) important part of bootstrap because we work with a lot of inputs

- [00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=2037) work with a lot of inputs from users impose group

- [00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=2047) oh i see so this disables wrapping there is also sizing

- [00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=2049) is also sizing like small

- [00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=2050) like small default large

- [00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=2059) okay we have check boxes and radius with input groups

- [00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=2078) uh we have modern add-ons like here so using you just need to have an idea

- [00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=2080) so using you just need to have an idea of

- [00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=2081) of what options you have you don't need to

- [00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=2083) what options you have you don't need to memorize this you can just return this

- [00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=2085) memorize this you can just return this page and look how they are done

- [00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=2088) page and look how they are done but

- [00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=2089) but to be able to do that you need to have

- [00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=2092) to be able to do that you need to have an idea

- [00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=2093) an idea of what is available and what is not

- [00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=2101) segmented buttons and then there is custom forms

- [00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=2105) and then there is custom forms so let's see the custom forms

- [00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=2107) so let's see the custom forms okay here

- [00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=2109) okay here you see we have options like this

- [00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=2112) you see we have options like this and here it is we have button and here

- [00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=2116) and here it is we have button and here like this

- [00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=2128) and we have custom file input you see we have upload button here

- [00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=2132) you see we have upload button here actually

- [00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=2133) actually do we need to click uploads

- [00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=2136) do we need to click uploads so upload is just a text it is another

- [00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=2139) so upload is just a text it is another button

- [00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=2140) button otherwise a choose file is a button

- [00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=2143) otherwise a choose file is a button and then you can have upload button here

- [00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=2146) and then you can have upload button here i think this is the button here you see

- [00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=2149) i think this is the button here you see so you can pick file and click button

- [00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=2151) so you can pick file and click button here

- [00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=2160) okay custom file input yeah and then we have loading labels

- [00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=2168) oh nice when i click it you see how it changed

- [00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=2173) so we just add loading here to the div

- [00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=2176) loading here to the div it has and it is automatically doing

- [00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=2178) it has and it is automatically doing everything

- [00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=2181) everything it's very cool

- [00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=2187) let's see how it looks with a regular html and post

- [00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=2203) okay so this is how it looks with a regular html

- [00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=2205) regular html email address password like this

- [00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=2208) email address password like this and this is how it looks with uh

- [00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=2211) and this is how it looks with uh yeah

- [00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=2213) yeah it's awesome

- [00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=2215) it's awesome and then there is text areas

- [00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=2218) and then there is text areas okay so the text area is something that

- [00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=2220) okay so the text area is something that you can change size like this

- [00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=2223) you can change size like this loading text area

- [00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=2234) okay so you see the folding text area and then there's select

- [00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=2236) and then there's select it's loading

- [00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=2241) okay it's loading labels

- [00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=2244) it's loading labels loading

- [00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=2252) [Music] select

- [00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=2258) and then there's layer arts so you can make them as

- [00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=2261) so you can make them as uh different

- [00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=2263) uh different colors like here

- [00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=2267) colors like here okay then there is layout

- [00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=2287) so we already have uh idea about layouts we have

- [00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=2289) we have margin utilities um

- [00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=2292) margin utilities um [Music]

- [00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=2293) [Music] so what's important here is

- [00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=2296) so what's important here is row column text

- [00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=2298) row column text cutters

- [00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=2303) we already seen all of these you see a row of

- [00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=2304) row of g3

- [00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=2305) g3 and g3 is

- [00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=2312) let's see i'm still having some problem to

- [00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=2314) i'm still having some problem to remember all of this

- [00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=2316) remember all of this i think it is inside here perhaps

- [00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=2328) so p3 is what's this

- [00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=2330) what's this let's see

- [00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=2342) okay so this is the page we are so yeah

- [00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=2343) yeah okay

- [00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=2344) okay so it's a great system and

- [00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=2395) so gutters are the gaps between column content created by horizontal padding

- [00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=2399) content created by horizontal padding okay okay i just remembered it so it

- [00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=2402) okay okay i just remembered it so it will set the the

- [00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=2404) will set the the space between these two

- [00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=2407) space between these two um

- [00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=2408) um let me show you

- [00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=2413) so you see it will take some time to

- [00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=2416) it will take some time to memorize all of them the first one will

- [00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=2418) memorize all of them the first one will be g6 and the second one will be g3

- [00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=2421) be g6 and the second one will be g3 actually i will make this

- [00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=2423) actually i will make this valve

- [00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=2425) valve okay and when i refresh the page

- [00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=2430) okay and when i refresh the page okay you see there's a huge difference

- [00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=2432) okay you see there's a huge difference between that will be actually what let's

- [00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=2435) between that will be actually what let's make this

- [00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=2437) make this six column first

- [00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=2442) okay it's uh the difference between these two is

- [00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=2444) the difference between these two is bigger than other one but

- [00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=2449) i think it is not being visible

- [00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=2457) because maybe g3 is not but it's what is the maximum g5 okay there is g5

- [00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=2461) the maximum g5 okay there is g5 and is there g6 no so g5 is maximum

- [00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=2469) okay you see the difference between this so this is g3 and this is the g5 yeah

- [00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=2471) so this is g3 and this is the g5 yeah are working

- [00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=2473) are working and so

- [00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=2475) and so is there anything different horizontal

- [00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=2478) is there anything different horizontal form

- [00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=2480) form there's column classes

- [00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=2483) there's column classes there's breakpoints and bsm

- [00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=2493) yeah there is nothing special here so there is g3

- [00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=2495) so there is g3 sm7 smsm

- [00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=2497) sm7 smsm [Music]

- [00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=2499) [Music] auto sizing

- [00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=2501) auto sizing inline forms okay there's nothing

- [00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=2503) inline forms okay there's nothing special here

- [00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=2506) special here so let's get to the validation

- [00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=2513) okay so we already have validation with astronaut at mvis automatically

- [00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=2519) and [Music]

- [00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=2524) okay so the validation here is

- [00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=2532) describing how it will be displayed you see when it is not valid it becomes like

- [00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=2535) see when it is not valid it becomes like this

- [00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=2548) to validate it we already have validation in our lectures

- [00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=2552) validation in our lectures let's see

- [00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=2553) let's see lecture 9 perhaps we have

- [00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=2556) lecture 9 perhaps we have validation dash yeah we have validation

- [00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=2559) validation dash yeah we have validation there

- [00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=2561) there uh so let's open the controller of

- [00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=2563) uh so let's open the controller of lecture nine

- [00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=2569) and let's give it a patch

- [00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=2570) patch okay we have lecture nine it should work

- [00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=2573) okay we have lecture nine it should work directly

- [00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=2584) okay and when i submit something invalid okay

- [00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=2585) okay so it is being displayed like this as

- [00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=2586) so it is being displayed like this as you see right now

- [00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=2589) you see right now and

- [00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=2591) and for validation i am going to add

- [00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=2595) for validation i am going to add some

- [00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=2597) some uh

- [00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=2598) uh class check here

- [00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=2602) so we need to set some classes into our

- [00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=2605) we need to set some classes into our lecture nine

- [00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=2607) lecture nine cs html okay

- [00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=2609) cs html okay so you see

- [00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=2611) so you see uh we are going to have form check class

- [00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=2619) here for bash for each div

- [00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=2622) for each div like this

- [00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=2627) okay so let's refresh the page

- [00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=2635) okay and then um [Music]

- [00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=2637) [Music] we need to add some for

- [00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=2641) we need to add some for check input class

- [00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=2656) okay there is no class so we need to set

- [00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=2658) so we need to set class ourself

- [00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=2659) class ourself [Music]

- [00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=2661) [Music] can set class here

- [00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=2667) using uh our others

- [00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=2670) our others yeah type would be easier which is at

- [00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=2672) yeah type would be easier which is at the bottom so

- [00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=2674) the bottom so i will use that on check

- [00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=2682) okay and

- [00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=2683) and this is much better approach as you know

- [00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=2686) this is much better approach as you know and then we have label

- [00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=2689) and then we have label and let's see the label is

- [00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=2692) and let's see the label is yeah that is labeled for

- [00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=2693) yeah that is labeled for so i'm going to set them as class form

- [00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=2695) so i'm going to set them as class form label

- [00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=2697) label um

- [00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=2698) um asp4

- [00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=2700) asp4 so we just need to add class form label

- [00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=2704) so we just need to add class form label class form label class form label

- [00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=2707) class form label class form label um [Music]

- [00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=2710) [Music] form label here

- [00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=2712) form label here okay

- [00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=2714) okay so we did set class form label

- [00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=2719) so we did set class form label to all

- [00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=2721) to all levels and then we need to add

- [00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=2725) levels and then we need to add okay class invalid feedback

- [00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=2728) okay class invalid feedback yeah

- [00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=2729) yeah so this uh

- [00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=2733) so this uh class involved feedback will be

- [00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=2740) set to i think

- [00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=2755) you see now it is much better formatted

- [00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=2757) better formatted um

- [00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=2759) um let's add something like this okay i'm

- [00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=2761) let's add something like this okay i'm not able to enter something like that

- [00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=2763) not able to enter something like that let's try this

- [00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=2764) let's try this okay so it is like this and when i hit

- [00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=2767) okay so it is like this and when i hit okay so you see they are being

- [00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=2768) okay so you see they are being differently visible

- [00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=2771) differently visible and

- [00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=2773) and however this is not

- [00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=2776) however this is not made

- [00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=2782) okay i think i need to add form control class to the inputs

- [00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=2790) let's format this page input

- [00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=2792) input class form control class form control

- [00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=2796) class form control class form control um

- [00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=2797) um and

- [00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=2798) and we have input class form control

- [00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=2802) we have input class form control okay here

- [00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=2804) okay here and here

- [00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=2806) and here and we have

- [00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=2808) and we have yes

- [00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=2810) yes okay let's refresh

- [00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=2841) by the way it may the form control may not be valid for some time such as

- [00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=2843) not be valid for some time such as birthday or

- [00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=2846) birthday or email i'm not sure

- [00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=2849) email i'm not sure okay it is taking too much time why

- [00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=2884) so validation is a really good option the server side

- [00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=2887) the server side okay is invalid invalid feedback has

- [00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=2890) okay is invalid invalid feedback has validation class

- [00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=2903) so you see if you add is invalid then it will be like this

- [00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=2915) okay now they are looking uh like this

- [00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=2917) like this and

- [00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=2918) and let's add something like this

- [00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=2920) let's add something like this okay they entered but it was not divided

- [00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=2922) okay they entered but it was not divided integers

- [00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=2924) integers but the text box is still not

- [00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=2928) but the text box is still not red

- [00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=2930) red the reason is okay now it is

- [00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=2932) the reason is okay now it is automatically getting

- [00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=2933) automatically getting displayed like this

- [00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=2940) and even um

- [00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=2942) um if we want to make it

- [00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=2943) if we want to make it [Music]

- [00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=2945) [Music] like this we need to add

- [00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=2949) like this we need to add is invalid class to our

- [00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=2955) class here and

- [00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=2955) and [Music]

- [00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=2957) [Music] yeah i think i need to search for it to

- [00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=2960) yeah i think i need to search for it to how to make it

- [00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=2962) how to make it let's see

- [00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=2973) okay [Music]

- [00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=2976) [Music] so someone has already asked that

- [00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=2980) so someone has already asked that okay

- [00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=3004) okay there are some just called i wonder if there is easier way

- [00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=3035) oh i see it is not that easy

- [00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=3036) it is not that easy so

- [00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=3038) so currently we will continue with that

- [00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=3045) okay but it is still looking cool we can also

- [00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=3047) we can also uh

- [00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=3049) uh add a close to this as

- [00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=3052) add a close to this as column

- [00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=3053) column let's say

- [00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=3055) let's say six

- [00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=3057) six and i'm refresh

- [00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=3060) and i'm refresh it won't take the entire space it will

- [00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=3062) it won't take the entire space it will just take a half of it

- [00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=3070) okay and supported elements input text area

- [00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=3073) supported elements input text area you see by default they can be like this

- [00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=3076) you see by default they can be like this and when you click it it returns

- [00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=3079) and when you click it it returns correct

- [00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=3087) let's see how it is done there is invalid feed page

- [00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=3095) let's copy and paste this to test yeah now it's taking half space

- [00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=3099) yeah now it's taking half space so i will copy this to

- [00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=3104) [Music] picture 15

- [00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=3107) picture 15 let's return back to main page

- [00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=3113) yeah by default you see they are red and when i check it

- [00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=3115) when i check it okay wow this is working great

- [00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=3122) you see they are becoming a

- [00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=3122) a check mark so how do we achieve that

- [00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=3126) check mark so how do we achieve that we achieve it with starting as is

- [00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=3128) we achieve it with starting as is invalid class adding that

- [00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=3134) so as

- [00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=3135) as until

- [00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=3136) until something is written

- [00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=3139) something is written you see it will be invalid

- [00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=3141) you see it will be invalid automatically like here it's pretty cool

- [00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=3145) automatically like here it's pretty cool so you can do this for

- [00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=3153) we can do this for i think our lecture nine

- [00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=3155) lecture nine so

- [00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=3156) so in here i'm going to add

- [00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=3160) in here i'm going to add a class

- [00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=3163) a class not here but

- [00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=3165) not here but input

- [00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=3166) input here is invalid and

- [00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=3168) here is invalid and [Music]

- [00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=3170) [Music] is invalid and

- [00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=3177) is invalid and is invalid

- [00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=3179) is invalid okay let's add it

- [00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=3181) okay let's add it to all

- [00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=3183) to all form controls

- [00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=3184) form controls and let's return back to lecture nine

- [00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=3195) you see they are all red by default and as soon as i add something

- [00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=3199) as soon as i add something okay it is not getting fixed

- [00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=3201) okay it is not getting fixed not getting fixed here

- [00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=3204) not getting fixed here okay they are all

- [00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=3207) okay they are all remaining as red

- [00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=3209) remaining as red y

- [00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=3215) so what is the difference between these and this

- [00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=3223) oh it is just having

- [00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=3226) it is just having a required talk therefore it is not

- [00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=3228) a required talk therefore it is not getting fixed

- [00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=3232) okay so let's also add that

- [00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=3235) let's also add that as required required

- [00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=3240) as required required required

- [00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=3243) required and required

- [00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=3249) required [Music]

- [00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=3251) [Music] requires okay

- [00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=3253) requires okay that's refresh

- [00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=3257) that's refresh now

- [00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=3257) now which has values can we fix it

- [00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=3260) which has values can we fix it no

- [00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=3292) um there is input checkbox fortune input

- [00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=3294) there is input checkbox fortune input required

- [00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=3305) form class was validated i see maybe this is the reason

- [00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=3320) let's add the selection nine as well so form check and

- [00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=3326) i think i will let's was validated

- [00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=3328) was validated let's see if it makes any difference

- [00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=3340) okay now i see validation here for the first one

- [00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=3342) for the first one oh i see so was validated needs to be

- [00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=3345) oh i see so was validated needs to be added here

- [00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=3347) added here and i think it will now become yeah now

- [00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=3350) and i think it will now become yeah now they are all validated because we didn't

- [00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=3352) they are all validated because we didn't load something

- [00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=3354) load something and when i delete it it becomes

- [00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=3356) and when i delete it it becomes invalidated and when i edit it becomes

- [00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=3358) invalidated and when i edit it becomes validated yeah

- [00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=3361) validated yeah however since we

- [00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=3370) enter something it is still being validated

- [00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=3371) validated screen like this

- [00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=3381) i think this is just checking that it has anything or not

- [00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=3383) has anything or not you see it's required tag

- [00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=3386) you see it's required tag so as long as you add something it tells

- [00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=3388) so as long as you add something it tells that it is validated and if you delete

- [00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=3390) that it is validated and if you delete it it becomes

- [00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=3392) it it becomes like this yeah

- [00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=3394) like this yeah okay and

- [00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=3396) okay and others there is there is tooltips

- [00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=3405) so what is all you see the tooltip is displaying

- [00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=3408) you see the tooltip is displaying uh messages as a tooltip how do we do

- [00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=3411) uh messages as a tooltip how do we do that

- [00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=3412) that we do it with valid tooltip yeah

- [00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=3414) we do it with valid tooltip yeah so let's add a valid tooltip to

- [00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=3419) so let's add a valid tooltip to our validation force

- [00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=3427) i think i can edit here class valid tooltip

- [00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=3428) tooltip this is for first name check

- [00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=3432) this is for first name check okay when i delete it

- [00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=3438) okay so it is being displayed like this

- [00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=3447) okay the tooltip is displayed in the in correct place and

- [00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=3449) correct place and since i added a color here is why it's

- [00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=3451) since i added a color here is why it's breaking how it should look

- [00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=3456) okay and let's make it okay now it is visible

- [00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=3460) and let's make it okay now it is visible but the positioning is not

- [00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=3463) but the positioning is not correct

- [00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=3467) because i think it should be division not as fun

- [00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=3470) not as fun when i refresh

- [00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=3504) so it has position relative ic so you see if you don't set position relative

- [00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=3507) see if you don't set position relative to your

- [00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=3509) to your form check

- [00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=3510) form check then the tooltip won't work

- [00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=3513) then the tooltip won't work and

- [00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=3514) and now

- [00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=3517) now it's still not working here

- [00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=3520) it's still not working here interesting

- [00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=3526) what is position relative needs validation no validate

- [00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=3549) okay [Music]

- [00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=3576) be sure to have a parent with position relative only fortune

- [00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=3583) so there is position reality maybe all classes needs position relative

- [01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=3606) you see these require some experimentation

- [01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=3608) experimentation therefore

- [01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=3619) anyway i want to spend time with that just add this to the

- [01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=3622) just add this to the our initiate html and see if it is

- [01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=3625) our initiate html and see if it is working dash

- [01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=3627) working dash okay

- [01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=3633) oh we have an error do we have add character yeah here

- [01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=3636) character yeah here okay and let's refresh

- [01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=3661) maybe because of the parents so if i take this

- [01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=3663) take this into here what happens

- [01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=3679) [Music] let's add this to the very top

- [01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=3693) i think for this work we need to add some javascript

- [01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=3696) some javascript it is not

- [01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=3697) it is not displayed here

- [01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=3700) displayed here which javascript do we have do we need

- [01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=3724) other [Music]

- [01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=3728) [Music]

- [01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=3740) yeah now it is working um

- [01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=3742) um okay

- [01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=3748) so you see it is selecting all needs validation classes and preventing

- [01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=3750) validation classes and preventing default

- [01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=3752) default and then i think was validated close to

- [01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=3754) and then i think was validated close to it

- [01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=3768) so yeah now let's add this

- [01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=3772) okay notes

- [01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=3786) and we have browser that was working just

- [01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=3788) just assets oversight

- [01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=3795) supported elements okay there's two tips

- [01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=3823) okay so how it works it use according to collapse

- [01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=3834) okay first let's clear everything

- [01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=3843) okay it is becoming slower since there is too much code in this page

- [01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=3847) is too much code in this page so

- [01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=3855) so let's add another page another index page

- [01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=3860) to as lecture 16.

- [01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=3908) okay we just need to

- [01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=3910) we just need to add

- [01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=3912) add razer page

- [01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=4068) oh i know there isn't it has to be inside that action not inside the class

- [01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=4071) inside that action not inside the class yeah

- [01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=4072) yeah so i will just return in this way

- [01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=4079) okay and lecture 16 in this html is here

- [01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=4084) lecture 16 in this html is here and let's just copy paste

- [01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=4086) and let's just copy paste so

- [01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=4088) so so what is this uh this is close

- [01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=4091) so what is this uh this is close according and it has occurred in item

- [01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=4095) according and it has occurred in item accordion header

- [01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=4096) accordion header accordion button

- [01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=4098) accordion button it has you see collapse

- [01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=4101) it has you see collapse and the target is collapse one and you

- [01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=4104) and the target is collapse one and you see area controls collapse one

- [01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=4107) see area controls collapse one according item one h2

- [01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=4110) according item one h2 and we have a

- [01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=4112) and we have a collapse one

- [01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=4113) collapse one id

- [01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=4119) and it will collapse it or not that's another application to see

- [01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=4130) you see the logic is simple it just collapses it or opens it with id here

- [01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=4133) collapses it or opens it with id here collapse 1 and arya controls collapse 1

- [01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=4136) collapse 1 and arya controls collapse 1 and target

- [01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=4138) and target is collapse 1.

- [01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=4150) and they are stacked inside uh deep class according with

- [01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=4153) deep class according with the class according item classes

- [01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=4156) the class according item classes and then there's headers and the item

- [01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=4158) and then there's headers and the item itself

- [01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=4161) itself okay so you see they are collapsible

- [01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=4165) okay so you see they are collapsible and it uses probably some jquery as well

- [01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=4176) it also has some nice transition okay

- [01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=4190) all right and then we have example and then there's flush

- [01:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=4198) so what is the difference between these two

- [01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=4211) which is not then there is always open you see is

- [01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=4214) then there is always open you see is important so for always open what we

- [01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=4218) important so for always open what we change

- [01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=4230) we just omit the data so we remove database parent attribute in

- [01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=4233) database parent attribute in on each accordion collapse

- [01:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=4236) on each accordion collapse where is it

- [01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=4241) database toggle database parent there is no such thing

- [01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=4243) database parent there is no such thing here

- [01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=4267) according collapse according according item according headers

- [01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=4270) item according headers we have iconic accounting headers

- [01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=4274) we have iconic accounting headers we have data yes toggle collapse

- [01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=4278) we have data yes toggle collapse i think we need more

- [01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=4280) i think we need more to anymore

- [01:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=4282) to anymore we have

- [01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=4283) we have id class iconic

- [01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=4290) okay collapsible means it will be showing

- [01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=4292) showing so what is removed here is

- [01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=4305) area controls are expanded oh here you see

- [01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=4307) oh here you see it has data vs parent according example

- [01:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=4311) it has data vs parent according example which is this

- [01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=4312) which is this so when you remove it

- [01:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=4314) so when you remove it it becomes always open

- [01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=4318) it becomes always open pretty simple

- [01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=4326) okay and there's nothing else then there's alerts okay

- [01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=4329) there's alerts okay so eyelash is just

- [01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=4331) so eyelash is just class

- [01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=4333) class which gives different colors nothing

- [01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=4335) which gives different colors nothing else

- [01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=4337) else we can just

- [01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=4338) we can just do example of it

- [01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=4342) do example of it it is a simple class which has different

- [01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=4344) it is a simple class which has different colorings

- [01:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=4350) you see i learned a lot morning i like primary alar dark

- [01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=4359) so when you remove one of the alerts what happens just highlight dark

- [01:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=4365) it is not anymore alert you see you need to have both classes

- [01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=4371) uh yeah then there's link colors i let's

- [01:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=4373) yeah then there's link colors i let's link utility

- [01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=4376) link utility it's also looking cool

- [01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=4385) okay let's also see that you see

- [01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=4387) see that you see uh links are looking like this

- [01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=4391) uh links are looking like this alert light and a large link

- [01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=4394) alert light and a large link so when i remove a large link what

- [01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=4396) so when i remove a large link what happens for example i will remove others

- [01:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=4399) happens for example i will remove others link in other slides

- [01:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=4402) link in other slides you see now it becomes a regular link

- [01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=4404) you see now it becomes a regular link like it's not anymore

- [01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=4413) um good example put this small from first one

- [01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=4423) okay yeah like this okay uh so that's also

- [01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=4438) colors and okay link color

- [01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=4445) and then there's additional content so it is as alert success and art

- [01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=4447) so it is as alert success and art heading

- [01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=4450) heading and and is for peak loss

- [01:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=4454) and and is for peak loss hr

- [01:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=4455) hr yeah

- [01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=4456) yeah then there's icons

- [01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=4458) then there's icons oh you see there's an icon here

- [01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=4461) oh you see there's an icon here so it starts with like

- [01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=4464) so it starts with like i can where is the icon

- [01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=4468) i can where is the icon is yeah it's an embedded

- [01:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=4470) is yeah it's an embedded [Music]

- [01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=4472) [Music] svg yeah

- [01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=4480) but this is really stupid to put entire svg here

- [01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=4485) i would not use it i would choose static icon that would be better

- [01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=4496) why did they make it like designers there is symbol

- [01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=4497) there is symbol so symbols are defined here then they

- [01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=4500) so symbols are defined here then they are used

- [01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=4505) um here with the class

- [01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=4508) here with the class so there is similar id you see

- [01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=4515) okay let's see the description

- [01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=4533) okay so this is a good one

- [01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=4539) see we have alert warning and are dismissible

- [01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=4541) dismissible and these two are how

- [01:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=4543) and these two are how it will be

- [01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=4545) it will be faded

- [01:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=4546) faded and roll alert is a strong and we have a

- [01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=4550) and roll alert is a strong and we have a button which has button clause

- [01:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=4552) button which has button clause and you see database dismiss alert it

- [01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=4555) and you see database dismiss alert it will dismiss this one

- [01:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=4558) will dismiss this one it means

- [01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=4560) it means an area label clause here

- [01:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=4562) an area label clause here so when refresh it

- [01:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=4564) so when refresh it these uses the javascript yeah

- [01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=4575) you see when analysis this message element is completely remote from the

- [01:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=4576) element is completely remote from the page structure if a keyboard user

- [01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=4578) page structure if a keyboard user dismisses allot using close button their

- [01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=4581) dismisses allot using close button their focus will suddenly be lost and

- [01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=4582) focus will suddenly be lost and depending on the browser reset the start

- [01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=4584) depending on the browser reset the start page document

- [01:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=4597) what does this mean is let me show you when i add this to the very

- [01:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=4600) when i add this to the very bottom of the page like this

- [01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=4603) bottom of the page like this let's see how it behaves the focus will

- [01:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=4605) let's see how it behaves the focus will be lost

- [01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=4608) be lost yeah nothing happens it stays there i

- [01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=4610) yeah nothing happens it stays there i think the behavior is good

- [01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=4618) okay bootstrap icons i think we can use bootstrap i can start acting like

- [01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=4620) bootstrap i can start acting like this so you see if i add this to my page

- [01:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=4624) this so you see if i add this to my page i should be able to use these icons

- [01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=4626) i should be able to use these icons automatically

- [01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=4628) automatically there's downloads there's compile css

- [01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=4631) there's downloads there's compile css and cs

- [01:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=4659) okay it is not visible so we have something missing

- [01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=4667) paste the svg right into your project's code

- [01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=4669) code why we can't include all of it

- [01:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=4676) so if i paste this code it should be visible let's try that yeah

- [01:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=4679) visible let's try that yeah however i don't want that i want to

- [01:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=4681) however i don't want that i want to include all icons how can we do that

- [01:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=4688) oh it is pretty big so there is downloads

- [01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=4691) so there is downloads um oh there's cdn yes

- [01:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=4694) um oh there's cdn yes okay

- [01:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=4696) okay i think this is

- [01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=4698) i think this is let's add the cdn into our

- [01:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=4710) oh i can edit my layout as well so there's our layout

- [01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=4713) there's our layout inside shaded layout

- [01:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=4716) inside shaded layout you see there's body

- [01:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=4718) you see there's body and my link

- [01:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=4721) and my link i will edit as this

- [01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=4724) i will edit as this and now

- [01:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=4726) and now it will be loaded at the beginning

- [01:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=4729) it will be loaded at the beginning so let's open the index

- [01:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=4732) so let's open the index here

- [01:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=4733) here and now without this i should be able to

- [01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=4735) and now without this i should be able to use it so let's restart

- [01:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=4746) you see i'm using layouts

- [01:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=4776) okay okay now the item is visible that file might be huge but

- [01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=4779) file might be huge but it will get

- [01:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=4781) it will get loaded into cage

- [01:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=4783) loaded into cage so when we refresh we should be able to

- [01:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=4785) so when we refresh we should be able to see that where is it

- [01:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=4788) see that where is it um

- [01:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=4793) from here

- [01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=4824) i won't add that svg to my page i will just use the classes

- [01:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=4827) i will just use the classes so let's add them like this and let's

- [01:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=4830) so let's add them like this and let's replace the page

- [01:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=4851) because i need to change it to eye i think not svg

- [01:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=4855) think not svg so let's try it

- [01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=4880) i the i class equal to

- [01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=4884) the i class equal to like this

- [01:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=4887) like this let's try

- [01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=4895) okay ask exclamation triangle it is not available

- [01:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=4900) i see exclamation triangle here

- [01:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=4905) exclamation triangle here so this is the oh i see the class name

- [01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=4908) so this is the oh i see the class name is different than what i have written

- [01:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=4911) is different than what i have written and

- [01:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=4912) and when we refresh

- [01:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=4915) when we refresh yeah now we can see it

- [01:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=4917) yeah now we can see it so you see now it is

- [01:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=4920) so you see now it is it doesn't have any padding

- [01:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=4923) it doesn't have any padding to have padding i need to have

- [01:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=4927) to have padding i need to have i think this edition it's a break point

- [01:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=4932) i think this edition it's a break point it's a margin x actually

- [01:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=4935) it's a margin x actually and now when i refresh

- [01:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=4937) and now when i refresh yes now it says margin

- [01:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=4939) yes now it says margin okay

- [01:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=4944) okay um [Music]

- [01:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=4945) [Music] that's not it

- [01:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=4968) okay how to load all the strap icons from cdm

- [01:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=4971) how to load all the strap icons from cdm and use them directly with proper class

- [01:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=4972) and use them directly with proper class name

- [01:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=4974) name and

- [01:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=4975) and yeah

- [01:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=4981) so we have anything that is diminishing we have seen that

- [01:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=4984) we have seen that let's also it

- [01:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=4994) [Music] okay

- [01:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=4995) okay then we have batch

- [01:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=5010) okay so let's continue with pages and

- [01:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=5022) badges scale to match the size of the immediate parent element by using

- [01:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=5024) immediate parent element by using relative font sizing and m units

- [01:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=5027) relative font sizing and m units as a v5 badges no longer have focus or

- [01:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=5030) as a v5 badges no longer have focus or hover styles for links

- [01:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=5032) hover styles for links okay so

- [01:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=5034) okay so it takes the size of the

- [01:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=5037) it takes the size of the immediate parent element which means the

- [01:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=5040) immediate parent element which means the immediate parent element is for example

- [01:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=5042) immediate parent element is for example h1 is here

- [01:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=5044) h1 is here you can also have notification page

- [01:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=5046) you can also have notification page something like this it is pretty cool

- [01:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=5049) something like this it is pretty cool so let's try that

- [01:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=5055) okay here and when we refresh

- [01:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=5061) you see it's a notification with a badge so pages is uh taking immediate parent

- [01:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=5064) so pages is uh taking immediate parent element

- [01:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=5066) element and which is being the button

- [01:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=5069) and which is being the button this is the parent element

- [01:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=5071) this is the parent element and

- [01:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=5073) and you can have something like this as well

- [01:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=5076) you can have something like this as well there is also visually hidden unread

- [01:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=5078) there is also visually hidden unread messages

- [01:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=5080) messages you see

- [01:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=5081) you see [Music]

- [01:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=5083) [Music] so it says that

- [01:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=5086) so it says that okay so what does it do okay so you see

- [01:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=5089) okay so what does it do okay so you see this information is being used for

- [01:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=5092) this information is being used for uh screen readers and assistive

- [01:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=5094) uh screen readers and assistive technologies

- [01:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=5095) technologies you can also have different

- [01:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=5098) you can also have different batch colors like this

- [01:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=5100) batch colors like this or peel badges as well

- [01:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=5107) okay so let's add them some

- [01:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=5109) add them some color

- [01:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=5110) color to add color we just use pj success or

- [01:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=5115) to add color we just use pj success or anything which is secondary not which is

- [01:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=5118) anything which is secondary not which is secondary but i will use vg

- [01:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=5121) secondary but i will use vg success

- [01:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=5123) success and

- [01:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=5124) and pg dot um

- [01:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=5129) light okay when we refresh it

- [01:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=5132) okay when we refresh it you see they are taking the color i have

- [01:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=5134) you see they are taking the color i have given

- [01:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=5136) given okay uh so

- [01:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=5144) pages colored pages okay

- [01:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=5149) and film bridges

- [01:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=5151) film bridges okay there's nothing special here and

- [01:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=5154) okay there's nothing special here and then we have breadcrumb breadcrumb

- [01:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=5164) so breadcrumb is a hierarchical uh navigation is extremely useful and it is

- [01:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=5166) navigation is extremely useful and it is commonly used as well

- [01:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=5168) commonly used as well so let's read it is important one

- [01:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=5172) so let's read it is important one breadcrumb

- [01:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=5174) breadcrumb indicate the current page's location

- [01:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=5175) indicate the current page's location within a navigational hierarchy that

- [01:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=5178) within a navigational hierarchy that automatically adds separators via css

- [01:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=5182) automatically adds separators via css okay

- [01:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=5183) okay example

- [01:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=5185) example use an ordered or unordered list with

- [01:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=5187) use an ordered or unordered list with linked list items to create a minimally

- [01:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=5189) linked list items to create a minimally styled breadcrumb

- [01:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=5191) styled breadcrumb use our utilities to add additional

- [01:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=5193) use our utilities to add additional styles as desired

- [01:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=5195) styles as desired okay let's

- [01:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=5196) okay let's [Music]

- [01:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=5197) [Music] test this

- [01:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=5204) i also would like to see how it looks in a

- [01:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=5205) a static html file as well

- [01:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=5209) static html file as well okay so you see our breadcrumb is

- [01:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=5211) okay so you see our breadcrumb is working

- [01:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=5213) working and

- [01:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=5215) and when we test it in this html page

- [01:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=5220) when we test it in this html page it is looking like this completely

- [01:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=5222) it is looking like this completely different than this you see

- [01:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=5225) different than this you see okay and

- [01:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=5228) okay and okay there are dividers we can change

- [01:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=5230) okay there are dividers we can change the divider style

- [01:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=5242) dividers are automatically added in css through before in content

- [01:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=5245) through before in content they can be changed by modifying a local

- [01:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=5247) they can be changed by modifying a local css custom property bs breadcrumb

- [01:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=5249) css custom property bs breadcrumb divider or through the dollar breadcrumb

- [01:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=5251) divider or through the dollar breadcrumb divider says variable and dollar

- [01:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=5253) divider says variable and dollar breadcrumb divider flipped for its rtl

- [01:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=5255) breadcrumb divider flipped for its rtl counterpart if needed

- [01:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=5257) counterpart if needed okay so

- [01:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=5260) okay so let's see if this is working as well

- [01:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=5267) yes you see it has a style uh in line style

- [01:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=5271) you see it has a style uh in line style modifiers

- [01:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=5272) modifiers actually i have

- [01:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=5275) actually i have never used this i believe this is

- [01:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=5276) never used this i believe this is modifying a css

- [01:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=5283) and you are setting a new divider like this

- [01:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=5286) divider like this let's see if it is working yeah it is

- [01:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=5289) let's see if it is working yeah it is working

- [01:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=5294) okay and there is this it's also possible to use an embedded svg icon

- [01:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=5306) so for embedded svg icon we are typing it's full

- [01:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=5309) it's full url like this

- [01:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=5320) okay you see this is an svg icon where it is

- [01:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=5321) it is yes

- [01:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=5328) it's also important one to take a note if you ever need a svg icon inside

- [01:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=5331) if you ever need a svg icon inside you can type it like this however

- [01:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=5342) okay it shows on unexpected characters let's see if it is working or not

- [01:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=5346) let's see if it is working or not yeah working

- [01:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=5353) so in the url it is typing for svg or i see some escape characters

- [01:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=5368) okay let's let's chrome speedy icons

- [01:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=5372) let's chrome speedy icons let's see if there's a way for that

- [01:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=5411) okay 3. svg but i'm not sure how we're going to make

- [01:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=5413) but i'm not sure how we're going to make it something like a single line

- [01:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=5487) why not yeah so it can take you around there i can

- [01:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=5489) so it can take you around there i can have a static url here

- [01:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=5492) have a static url here i will edit the images at

- [01:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=5495) i will edit the images at existing item

- [01:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=5500) and it's inside downloads right arrow

- [01:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=5504) it's inside downloads right arrow so here's is going to be a url

- [01:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=5508) so here's is going to be a url therefore make something like this

- [01:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=5515) no okay so

- [01:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=5524) yeah let's try this show the url i'm not sure if it can work

- [01:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=5527) show the url i'm not sure if it can work or not

- [01:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=5537) no it is not working let's see if this

- [01:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=5539) let's see if this uh getting the

- [01:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=5541) uh getting the svg i can

- [01:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=5543) svg i can yeah so we have a problem with patting

- [01:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=5547) yeah so we have a problem with patting you see it is trying to get url from

- [01:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=5552) you see it is trying to get url from here

- [01:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=5554) here therefore we need to provide maybe

- [01:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=5557) therefore we need to provide maybe something like this

- [01:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=5577) bootstrap [Music]

- [01:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=5597) probably it is related to their javascript

- [01:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=5601) their javascript so

- [01:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=5642) so we need to convert that svg into base 64.

- [01:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=5685) then code svg base64 like this

- [01:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=5686) like this so i think it will work now um

- [01:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=5690) so i think it will work now um how was it

- [01:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=5695) linked yeah here

- [01:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=5697) yeah here so we will just give

- [01:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=5700) so we will just give okay something like this

- [01:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=5703) okay something like this letting you at all images video examine

- [01:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=5705) letting you at all images video examine base64

- [01:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=5708) base64 and here are

- [01:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=5709) and here are a 64

- [01:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=5712) a 64 like this

- [01:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=5713) like this yeah it's just looking pretty

- [01:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=5716) yeah it's just looking pretty layered and refresh

- [01:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=5719) layered and refresh yeah

- [01:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=5721) yeah all right

- [01:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=5723) all right we have changed it

- [01:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=5735) look at his base fix the power

- [01:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=5754) okay it shows the image here so

- [01:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=5755) so it is working correctly

- [01:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=5762) we can see the preview of svg like here as you see

- [01:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=5764) as you see however it is not visible

- [01:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=5781) url data image svg maybe we need to add some style as well

- [01:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=5791) okay data image svg examiner sweetheart but

- [01:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=5805) so in the downloaded probably we need to set

- [01:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=5808) probably we need to set pixels like this

- [01:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=5812) pixels like this [Music]

- [01:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=5822) no still not set so let's set it and hit here

- [01:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=5829) let's include one eight eight

- [01:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=5832) eight eight eight

- [01:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=5836) yeah so let's

- [01:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=5838) so let's base and cook this

- [01:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=5849) i'm not sure if it's gonna work or not yeah we have a new base encoding

- [01:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=5852) yeah we have a new base encoding and here let's edit

- [01:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=5856) and here let's edit refresh

- [01:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=5857) refresh yeah now working okay you see

- [01:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=5860) yeah now working okay you see i can also change its size to let's say

- [01:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=5864) i can also change its size to let's say 16 so it should still work i think it

- [01:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=5867) 16 so it should still work i think it will look

- [01:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=5868) will look double size

- [01:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=5871) double size so this shouldn't make any difference

- [01:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=5873) so this shouldn't make any difference you can even remove this i think

- [01:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=5877) you can even remove this i think yeah

- [01:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=5878) yeah and let's re-upload

- [01:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=5887) we can also copy paste it into svg convert i mean a base64 converter

- [01:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=5891) convert i mean a base64 converter and when i edit

- [01:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=5897) yeah okay um

- [01:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=5899) okay um so we have seen how to make a custom

- [01:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=5902) so we have seen how to make a custom breadcrumb

- [01:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=5923) how to use a custom svg image as

- [01:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=5927) a custom svg image as a breadcrumb

- [01:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=5928) a breadcrumb separator

- [01:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=5930) separator with

- [01:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=5932) with a 64 method okay

- [01:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=5942) okay so it is working uh let's move to the next which is buttons

- [01:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=5946) the next which is buttons okay buttons are one of the most

- [01:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=5948) okay buttons are one of the most commonly used elements

- [01:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=5951) commonly used elements in web development

- [01:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=5953) in web development and bootstrap already have some

- [01:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=5957) and bootstrap already have some regular buttons like this but

- [01:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=5959) regular buttons like this but you can of course have a

- [01:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=5962) you can of course have a better buttons with using a custom

- [01:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=5964) better buttons with using a custom classes

- [01:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=5967) classes so they are basically like this this is

- [01:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=5969) so they are basically like this this is a simple and elegant design however

- [01:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=5972) a simple and elegant design however of course it is up to you to

- [01:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=5979) improve your design okay let's refresh

- [01:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=5981) okay let's refresh and you see there like this they have

- [01:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=5983) and you see there like this they have hover effect they have active effect

- [01:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=5987) hover effect they have active effect uh however of course uh

- [01:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=5990) uh however of course uh you can

- [01:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=5991) you can also use custom models

- [01:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=5993) also use custom models let me show you one of my favorites

- [01:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=5995) let me show you one of my favorites button

- [01:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=5997) button that i use my own website

- [01:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=5999) that i use my own website this is also pure

- [01:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6008) okay uh you see

- [01:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6009) you see it is like this

- [01:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6011) it is like this uh so you can have gradients having

- [01:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6014) uh so you can have gradients having buttons

- [01:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6015) buttons and other custom things it's up to you

- [01:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6019) and other custom things it's up to you about this but also pretty much work

- [01:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6023) about this but also pretty much work there is also

- [01:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6024) there is also uh disabled buttons for example

- [01:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6027) uh disabled buttons for example for disabled i think just we add

- [01:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6030) for disabled i think just we add uh

- [01:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6031) uh disables let me see

- [01:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6034) disables let me see you can have uh block buttons like this

- [01:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6042) you see when you add md block it becomes block

- [01:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6044) block uh there is also justify content we have

- [01:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6047) uh there is also justify content we have already seen that

- [01:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6049) already seen that see there's toggle active circle disable

- [01:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6051) see there's toggle active circle disable toggle for disable it we just add

- [01:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6058) disable it uh word to the bottom for example like

- [01:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6060) uh word to the bottom for example like this

- [01:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6061) this and now it will become disabled you see

- [01:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6066) and now it will become disabled you see okay and

- [01:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6069) okay and let's see if there's another way

- [01:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6082) okay and then there is button group you see you can also group buttons like this

- [01:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6085) see you can also group buttons like this for buttonwood you just add class button

- [01:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6088) for buttonwood you just add class button group

- [01:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6089) group and this you can have a roll as well

- [01:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6093) and this you can have a roll as well what happens if we remove roll up under

- [01:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6097) what happens if we remove roll up under that

- [01:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6104) okay they are working as expected when we hit row

- [01:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6111) nothing changes and since this is the bottom group it is

- [01:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6113) and since this is the bottom group it is not as you see

- [01:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6116) not as you see it is in line it is not block

- [01:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6118) it is in line it is not block i think we can have

- [01:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6121) i think we can have div look like this and now it will be

- [01:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6124) div look like this and now it will be get take the entire row let me refresh

- [01:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6127) get take the entire row let me refresh you see

- [01:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6129) you see i can also add some margin

- [01:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6132) i can also add some margin uh like m4

- [01:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6135) uh like m4 and now it will have some space

- [01:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6138) and now it will have some space you see like this

- [01:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6140) you see like this and if i want only certain

- [01:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6143) and if i want only certain size to have margin

- [01:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6146) size to have margin not x exports margin

- [01:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6149) not x exports margin yeah

- [01:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6151) yeah like this it will have margin like this

- [01:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6153) like this it will have margin like this yeah

- [01:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6159) okay uh so okay so it says you need to ensure

- [01:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6161) okay so it says you need to ensure correct role provides level y

- [01:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6170) ensure correct role and provide a label in order for assistive technologies such

- [01:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6172) in order for assistive technologies such as screen readers to convey that a

- [01:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6174) as screen readers to convey that a series of buttons is grouped an

- [01:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6176) series of buttons is grouped an appropriate role attribute needs to be

- [01:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6178) appropriate role attribute needs to be provided

- [01:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6179) provided for button groups this would be role

- [01:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6181) for button groups this would be role equals group while toolbars should have

- [01:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6183) equals group while toolbars should have a role equals toolbar

- [01:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6186) a role equals toolbar in addition groups and toolbars should

- [01:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6188) in addition groups and toolbars should be given an explicit label as most

- [01:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6190) be given an explicit label as most assistive technologies will otherwise

- [01:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6192) assistive technologies will otherwise not announce them despite the presence

- [01:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6194) not announce them despite the presence of the correct role attribute

- [01:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6196) of the correct role attribute in the examples provided here we use

- [01:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6198) in the examples provided here we use aria label but alternatives such as arya

- [01:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6201) aria label but alternatives such as arya labeled by can also be used so this is

- [01:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6203) labeled by can also be used so this is for

- [01:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6204) for assistive technologies such as

- [01:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6206) assistive technologies such as imagine that there is a

- [01:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6209) imagine that there is a vision

- [01:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6210) vision problem-saving person and uses assisted

- [01:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6213) problem-saving person and uses assisted technologies

- [01:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6215) technologies and when the screen reader reads your

- [01:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6217) and when the screen reader reads your website if you don't provide role and

- [01:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6219) website if you don't provide role and area label

- [01:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6221) area label they won't be properly read to the user

- [01:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6224) they won't be properly read to the user so this improves your website usability

- [01:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6228) so this improves your website usability across

- [01:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6230) across impaired individuals as well it's pretty

- [01:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6233) impaired individuals as well it's pretty extremely useful you should use that you

- [01:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6235) extremely useful you should use that you see there is deep class button group

- [01:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6238) see there is deep class button group and

- [01:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6240) and recurrent page

- [01:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6243) recurrent page okay so

- [01:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6246) okay so yeah you can also use ref as a bottom

- [01:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6250) yeah you can also use ref as a bottom group here

- [01:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6251) group here they are a little bit different

- [01:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6259) okay um [Music]

- [01:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6262) [Music] you see this margin we have added here

- [01:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6265) you see this margin we have added here uh has changed the way

- [01:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6268) uh has changed the way adam's

- [01:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6273) margin what tell me use

- [01:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6279) i think but there's also

- [01:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6280) but there's also okay

- [01:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6282) okay we can also have a theme like this

- [01:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6302) oh i see so when i make this

- [01:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6314) yeah display block is changing the behavior of

- [01:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6317) behavior of bottom group interestingly

- [01:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6328) so this is position relative in life like i see

- [01:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6331) like i see that is how it is done

- [01:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6334) that is how it is done so about the change in life like it's

- [01:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6336) so about the change in life like it's breaking

- [01:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6337) breaking however we can just

- [01:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6340) however we can just encapsulate it with another dive

- [01:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6344) encapsulate it with another dive and now it will be like this okay

- [01:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6348) and now it will be like this okay you can have mixed styles like this

- [01:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6352) you can have mixed styles like this and or outline styles like this check

- [01:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6356) and or outline styles like this check boxes

- [01:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6358) boxes you see they are also toggled

- [01:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6362) you see they are also toggled so you can toggle them

- [01:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6364) so you can toggle them or to have toggle we just add

- [01:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6368) or to have toggle we just add input type checkbox class button check

- [01:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6372) input type checkbox class button check and there is

- [01:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6379) label for that one you see it uses ptn checkpoint which is the id of this

- [01:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6383) checkpoint which is the id of this input

- [01:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6385) input it's pretty cool

- [01:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6399) okay and you can also have radio or you can even have button toolbars

- [01:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6407) there are you see multiple button groups in button toolbars

- [01:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6410) in button toolbars you can also mix them

- [01:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6413) you can also mix them you can also have sizing you can also

- [01:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6415) you can also have sizing you can also have nesting

- [01:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6416) have nesting with drop down menu

- [01:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6419) with drop down menu you can also very

- [01:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6420) you can also very vertical

- [01:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6459) we don't need to memorize it you just need to know what to look for and what

- [01:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6462) need to know what to look for and what options there are

- [01:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6495) cards bootstraps cards provide a flexible and

- [01:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6497) bootstraps cards provide a flexible and extensible content container with

- [01:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6499) extensible content container with multiple variants and options

- [01:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6502) multiple variants and options okay it's important to understand this

- [01:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6504) okay it's important to understand this about

- [01:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6506) about a card is a flexible and extensible

- [01:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6508) a card is a flexible and extensible content container

- [01:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6510) content container it includes options for headers and

- [01:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6512) it includes options for headers and footers a wide variety of content

- [01:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6521) if you're familiar with bootstrap 3 cards replace our old panels wells and

- [01:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6523) cards replace our old panels wells and thumbnails

- [01:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6525) thumbnails similar functionality to those

- [01:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6527) similar functionality to those components is available as modifier

- [01:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6529) components is available as modifier classes for cards

- [01:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6531) classes for cards example

- [01:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6533) example cards are built with as little markup

- [01:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6535) cards are built with as little markup and styles as possible but still manage

- [01:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6537) and styles as possible but still manage to deliver a ton of control and

- [01:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6539) to deliver a ton of control and customization

- [01:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6540) customization built with flexbox they offer easy

- [01:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6543) built with flexbox they offer easy alignment and mix well with other

- [01:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6544) alignment and mix well with other bootstrap components

- [01:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6546) bootstrap components they have no margin by default so use

- [01:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6549) they have no margin by default so use spacing utilities as needed

- [01:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6551) spacing utilities as needed so spacing utilities are m this is

- [01:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6554) so spacing utilities are m this is margin p padding

- [01:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6556) margin p padding and

- [01:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6557) and t is top p is bottom s is left

- [01:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6563) t is top p is bottom s is left and e is right

- [01:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6564) and e is right x is left and right i is top and bottom

- [01:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6569) x is left and right i is top and bottom so it is light is mt zero this is top s

- [01:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6573) so it is light is mt zero this is top s is i think

- [01:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6575) is i think left

- [01:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6577) left yeah

- [01:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6578) yeah you can also make negative margin

- [01:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6582) you can also make negative margin okay let's uh

- [01:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6584) okay let's uh test

- [01:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6585) test this card so for card we use class cards

- [01:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6590) this card so for card we use class cards we can also have style

- [01:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6640) you see card is here it is looking great it's so few lines of code

- [01:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6644) it's so few lines of code uh it can be also customized you see

- [01:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6647) uh it can be also customized you see there's card body title text links

- [01:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6660) these groups are also inside the card like this

- [01:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6662) card like this so card is extremely useful for

- [01:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6667) so card is extremely useful for grouping

- [01:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6668) grouping elements you see

- [01:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6670) elements you see and if i want a margin i need to add

- [01:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6674) and if i want a margin i need to add like this

- [01:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6675) like this so i'm b5 it will have

- [01:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6679) so i'm b5 it will have margin bottom

- [01:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6688) and you can have future card header like this

- [01:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6690) like this card folder

- [01:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6691) card folder kitchen sink

- [01:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6693) kitchen sink okay

- [01:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6694) okay so you see this

- [01:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6696) so you see this this is the cart

- [01:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6698) this is the cart and it combines

- [01:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6701) and it combines multiple elements for example

- [01:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6715) okay like this card title an item an item an item a link link

- [01:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6718) item an item a link link and an image

- [01:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6720) and an image you can also have header footers so it

- [01:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6723) you can also have header footers so it is looking great let's copy this as well

- [01:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6738) and let's refresh we say features so it is taking full

- [01:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6741) we say features so it is taking full space by default

- [01:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6743) space by default however i think i can add call

- [01:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6747) however i think i can add call for

- [01:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6748) for call 6 so it will take only half of the

- [01:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6750) call 6 so it will take only half of the space

- [01:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6751) space not the full space i'm pretty sure it

- [01:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6753) not the full space i'm pretty sure it supports yeah

- [01:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6755) supports yeah you see now it is taking half of the

- [01:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6757) you see now it is taking half of the space of the my

- [01:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6759) space of the my entire screen

- [01:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6762) entire screen so when i even make this small it will

- [01:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6765) so when i even make this small it will still take a half of space

- [01:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6767) still take a half of space but other things will take uh the ram

- [01:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6772) but other things will take uh the ram and when they get smaller they may also

- [01:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6775) and when they get smaller they may also get smaller according to yeah why

- [01:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6778) get smaller according to yeah why changes because ram is

- [01:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6781) changes because ram is based on screen size i think

- [01:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6796) and it probably changes when you make a screen smaller

- [01:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6800) okay and

- [01:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6802) and you can also have quarter cards like

- [01:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6804) you can also have quarter cards like this and another card with text center

- [01:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6808) this and another card with text center you see when you are working with

- [01:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6809) you see when you are working with bootstrap

- [01:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6810) bootstrap you just can uh nest

- [01:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6814) you just can uh nest uh or

- [01:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6816) uh or or let's say nas nest but append

- [01:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6818) or let's say nas nest but append multiple classes

- [01:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6820) multiple classes so this is the combination of card and

- [01:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6822) so this is the combination of card and text center so it is entire text

- [01:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6826) text center so it is entire text centered you can also have size

- [01:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6834) so you see for sizing they have used a

- [01:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6837) you see for sizing they have used a column like i did

- [01:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6839) column like i did you can also use

- [01:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6841) you can also use utilities so

- [01:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6843) utilities so bw75 i think it will take 75 percent

- [01:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6847) bw75 i think it will take 75 percent so it should be equal to call eight

- [01:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6858) and i think we can also set

- [01:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6860) i think we can also set custom i'm not sure let's see

- [01:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6863) custom i'm not sure let's see oh no there's no custom

- [01:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6866) oh no there's no custom yeah

- [01:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6869) yeah and what does that is

- [01:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6871) and what does that is that is using custom css

- [01:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6879) yeah like this text alignment

- [01:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6881) text alignment navigation or you see even navigation

- [01:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6884) navigation or you see even navigation can be

- [01:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6885) can be made as a cart

- [01:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6888) made as a cart so let's copy paste it and analyze it so

- [01:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6892) so let's copy paste it and analyze it so there's card text centers

- [01:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6894) there's card text centers i can also set this as

- [01:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6916) i'm still having memorization problem not used to that

- [01:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6929) okay when we add a container class to this

- [01:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6934) yeah it should have some default positioning

- [01:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6935) positioning yeah

- [01:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6936) yeah now it is position centered and yeah it

- [01:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6939) now it is position centered and yeah it is working

- [01:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6941) is working as expected

- [01:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6947) it also has some default padding as you see

- [01:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6948) see we can also analyze it and see the

- [01:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6950) we can also analyze it and see the padding

- [01:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6951) padding since we added a container class

- [01:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6954) since we added a container class so from the container class it is

- [01:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6956) so from the container class it is getting

- [01:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6963) let's see where is it so margin left margin right padding left yeah so the

- [01:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6966) margin right padding left yeah so the padding is 0.75

- [01:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6970) padding is 0.75 irm by default when i remove them you

- [01:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6972) irm by default when i remove them you see padding is gone

- [01:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6975) see padding is gone that is how container works i can also

- [01:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6977) that is how container works i can also set a custom padding i think like this

- [01:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6981) set a custom padding i think like this zero so it will it should overwrite yeah

- [01:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6983) zero so it will it should overwrite yeah it has overridden the

- [01:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6986) it has overridden the uh

- [01:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6986) uh padding of container and it has

- [01:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6989) padding of container and it has important pack

- [01:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6990) important pack that is how it overrides it

- [01:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6994) that is how it overrides it okay

- [01:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6995) okay as you use it you will

- [01:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6997) as you use it you will get

- [01:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=6999) get used to it

- [01:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=7000) used to it you see there's also image cop

- [01:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=7004) you see there's also image cop oh image overlay let's test this tool

- [01:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=7007) oh image overlay let's test this tool so for image overlay

- [01:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=7011) so for image overlay let's uh

- [01:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=7013) let's uh get

- [01:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=7014) get and

- [01:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=7020) a wallpaper from here for example

- [01:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=7022) for example here this one

- [01:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=7025) here this one and

- [01:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=7026) and from here

- [01:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=7031) okay let's see how it looks

- [01:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=7038) yeah this is working it's taking the full space

- [01:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=7040) full space right now um

- [01:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=7043) right now um can i make this smaller i'm not sure

- [01:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=7046) can i make this smaller i'm not sure let's add

- [01:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=7051) four it should be automatically resize it

- [01:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=7055) it should be automatically resize it yeah yeah it is resized to fit

- [01:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=7058) yeah yeah it is resized to fit and that is the

- [01:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=7061) and that is the um

- [01:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=7066) text text is not very much visible though

- [01:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=7067) though so for text maybe we can add some

- [01:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=7069) so for text maybe we can add some backgrounds

- [01:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=7074) pg dark let's see how it makes what kind of

- [01:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=7076) dark let's see how it makes what kind of difference

- [01:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=7078) difference yeah

- [01:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=7079) yeah not working

- [01:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=7099) oh this child this just uses

- [01:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=7102) this child this just uses row and columns you see there is a row

- [01:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=7104) row and columns you see there is a row and there is a column and there is

- [01:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=7105) and there is a column and there is another column

- [01:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=7107) another column that is how you can horizontally

- [01:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=7110) that is how you can horizontally set it it's pretty convenient to use

- [01:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=7112) set it it's pretty convenient to use it's pretty easy elegant

- [01:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=7116) it's pretty easy elegant okay when i refresh the page

- [01:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=7123) you see it is here okay there's also card style so we can

- [01:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=7127) okay there's also card style so we can set a card style as well

- [01:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=7141) like border primary border secondary border success border dangers

- [01:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=7144) border success border dangers and i can mix them with um

- [01:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=7147) and i can mix them with um background as well for example for

- [01:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=7150) background as well for example for borders info let's add

- [01:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=7170) different border as you see so when i set border danger as well

- [01:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=7177) how it looks yeah it looks like this

- [01:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=7183) you can also set another for example let's set the borders warning

- [01:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=7187) let's set the borders warning we can also set borders i think

- [01:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=7194) which so border 3 it should be related to size of the

- [01:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=7196) it should be related to size of the border yeah

- [01:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=7198) border yeah and what other options we have we have

- [02:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=7201) and what other options we have we have borders button

- [02:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=7856) and no

- [02:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=7871) let's check the source code so

- [02:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=7872) so this has corrosol inners

- [02:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=7875) this has corrosol inners and we have cortisone like this

- [02:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=7879) and we have cortisone like this yeah so the corrosion is taking full

- [02:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=7881) yeah so the corrosion is taking full space

- [02:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=7882) space so i'll probably i need to set the

- [02:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=7884) so i'll probably i need to set the border to corrosol in the not the

- [02:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=7886) border to corrosol in the not the correspond itself

- [02:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=7888) correspond itself so let's remove this and

- [02:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=7890) so let's remove this and let's get this border into the corrosion

- [02:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=7893) let's get this border into the corrosion image like this

- [02:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=7899) okay let's refresh okay still not visible

- [02:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=7913) okay there is border but i don't see the borders

- [02:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=7920) border with border colors but it is not visible

- [02:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=7922) but it is not visible yeah very weird

- [02:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=7931) overflow hidden wait position

- [02:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=7966) background workspace border is not working yeah

- [02:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=7968) working yeah you see since i have remote it's uh our

- [02:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=7972) you see since i have remote it's uh our phone healing yeah

- [02:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=7974) phone healing yeah not working

- [02:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=8020) oh regular border is working

- [02:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=8023) regular border is working this is b i see

- [02:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=8025) this is b i see first i need to add border

- [02:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=8027) first i need to add border and then i need to add the border style

- [02:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=8030) and then i need to add the border style like this

- [02:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=8031) like this now it'll work here

- [02:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=8034) now it'll work here okay you see it is working as expected

- [02:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=8038) okay you see it is working as expected um [Music]

- [02:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=8041) [Music] the bottom color is still pretty

- [02:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=8047) uh invisible so we if we remove aria

- [02:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=8050) invisible so we if we remove aria let's make this false

- [02:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=8056) and yeah no difference

- [02:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=8062) so i need to change the color of this i think

- [02:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=8088) there provide the next next icon [Music]

- [02:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=8090) [Music] let's see if we can change icon of this

- [02:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=8093) let's see if we can change icon of this color

- [02:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=8104) yeah someone already asked probably that arrow icon colors

- [02:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=8107) arrow icon colors how can we change it

- [02:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=8121) oh you can even set svg

- [02:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=8124) you can even set svg so let's try that

- [02:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=8127) so let's try that we have already learned how to

- [02:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=8129) we have already learned how to set svg

- [02:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=8140) so you see it is using the same oh it will work

- [02:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=8143) using the same oh it will work oh it worked

- [02:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=8145) oh it worked but image is still uh

- [02:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=8152) as you see it's a bigger image though as you can see

- [02:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=8159) i think we can provide an image here directly

- [02:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=8161) directly so

- [02:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=8163) so or url you see now it is

- [02:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=8165) or url you see now it is telling me to root

- [02:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=8167) telling me to root then images

- [02:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=8169) then images then

- [02:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=8170) then [Music]

- [02:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=8171) [Music] let's find and color

- [02:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=8174) let's find and color arrow icon

- [02:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=8181) i think you already have arrow icon here so it is the right arrow svg

- [02:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=8189) and then refresh yeah

- [02:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=8190) yeah oh nice

- [02:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=8192) oh nice it's looking nice as you see

- [02:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=8195) it's looking nice as you see it even have fading effect as well

- [02:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=8202) so what i need is i need to

- [02:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=8204) what i need is i need to reverse image

- [02:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=8208) reverse image um

- [02:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=8209) um background image reverse function

- [02:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=8211) background image reverse function movement

- [02:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=8218) let's see css rotate

- [02:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=8221) css rotate reverse image

- [02:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=8240) but since the background oh no no it's working

- [02:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=8241) working and

- [02:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=8243) and now this will say

- [02:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=8245) now this will say we don't use scale

- [02:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=8248) we don't use scale okay

- [02:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=8249) okay you see now we have custom

- [02:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=8262) you can even have indicators so four indicators what do we have

- [02:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=8266) so four indicators what do we have here here are the indicators

- [02:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=8269) here here are the indicators let's add it to our corosal

- [02:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=8272) let's add it to our corosal here

- [02:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=8274) here let's refresh

- [02:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=8275) let's refresh so indicators are you see at the bottom

- [02:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=8279) so indicators are you see at the bottom however they are not clickable

- [02:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=8286) and with captions if you want so for captions we just add colors or

- [02:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=8289) so for captions we just add colors or caption

- [02:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=8299) where do we edit we added on inside the correspond item

- [02:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=8303) inside the correspond item uh yeah now the caption is visible

- [02:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=8310) okay and crossfade crossfade

- [02:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=8313) crossfade crossfade oh nice

- [02:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=8314) oh nice so let's add it to the it is just a

- [02:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=8317) so let's add it to the it is just a close addition

- [02:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=8319) close addition um

- [02:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=8320) um to the colossal here

- [02:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=8322) to the colossal here like this

- [02:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=8324) like this so when we refresh

- [02:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=8326) so when we refresh yeah now fading is working

- [02:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=8345) yeah same thing yeah same effect so if you want this you can make it like this

- [02:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=8348) you want this you can make it like this i don't know if we can fade it faster

- [02:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=8351) i don't know if we can fade it faster page

- [02:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=8357) no probably not can we change the page speech

- [02:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=8381) oh there is what is this

- [02:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=8388) there is some options options can pass the javascript

- [02:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=8392) the javascript so internal methods i see

- [02:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=8400) so you see we can change the corosal interval as well

- [02:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=8403) the corosal interval as well by the way is our corrosion

- [02:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=8405) by the way is our corrosion automatically

- [02:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=8406) automatically changing no

- [02:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=8409) changing no for it to change let's add the

- [02:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=8411) for it to change let's add the javascript to the

- [02:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=8413) javascript to the very end such as script

- [02:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=8417) very end such as script corrosons so it will affect all corrosor

- [02:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=8420) corrosons so it will affect all corrosor classes

- [02:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=8433) maybe we also need to set auto starts or something

- [02:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=8439) or also interval very oh i see so there is an interval here

- [02:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=8449) so let's set partisan

- [02:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=8451) partisan this is for

- [02:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=8465) so you can also have dark color colors of dark

- [02:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=8467) colors of dark you see it changes our

- [02:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=8469) you see it changes our colors

- [02:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=8470) colors as custom

- [02:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=8472) as custom oh there is transition duration

- [02:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=8479) how do we set it you can say that it's css i think

- [02:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=8496) so [Music]

- [02:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=8498) [Music] let's try it

- [02:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=8511) and i will type it inside here uh by the way this this has to be self

- [02:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=8515) uh by the way this this has to be self uh

- [02:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=8517) uh executing

- [02:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=8519) executing uh

- [02:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=8521) uh let's set is that a function

- [02:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=8523) let's set is that a function test

- [02:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=8538) we have our corosal and we need to set corrosion or something

- [02:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=8588) okay now when we refresh

- [02:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=8596) yeah now auto changing with 2000 interval

- [02:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=8598) 2000 interval let's make this one thousands

- [02:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=8615) okay interval seems like not working so when i remove this

- [02:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=8617) so when i remove this let's see what happens

- [02:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=8620) let's see what happens i think it has some automatic

- [02:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=8626) interval here so we can change the corrosion interval

- [02:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=8629) so we can change the corrosion interval from

- [02:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=8638) let's see where is the entire wall we don't need javascript for that

- [02:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=8640) we don't need javascript for that okay here

- [02:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=8642) okay here um

- [02:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=8645) i think [Music]

- [02:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=8647) [Music] we can set it from here perhaps

- [02:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=8651) we can set it from here perhaps database interval 1000

- [02:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=8659) so let's test it out yeah you see now what each one second it

- [02:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=8662) yeah you see now what each one second it is

- [02:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=8663) is changing

- [02:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=8665) changing however it stops changing when i hover

- [02:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=8667) however it stops changing when i hover my mouse over it

- [02:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=8669) my mouse over it and then it starts automatic changing as

- [02:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=8672) and then it starts automatic changing as well

- [02:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=8673) well so if i make this 100 millisecond it

- [02:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=8675) so if i make this 100 millisecond it should be pretty fast

- [02:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=8684) okay and yeah

- [02:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=8686) and yeah this is it

- [02:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=8692) so let's

- [02:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=8699) see what is crucial correspond is hard to pronounce

- [02:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=8701) correspond is hard to pronounce always works

- [02:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=8725) custom svg image yeah

- [02:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=8727) yeah with indicators

- [02:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=8733) and with captions

- [02:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=8739) and crossfade

- [02:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=8748) okay individual custom gross lighting interval

- [02:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=8752) um disable touch swiping you can also

- [02:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=8755) disable touch swiping you can also disable touch swiping with

- [02:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=8758) disable touch swiping with here database touch false

- [02:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=8761) here database touch false so it will be disabled with touch

- [02:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=8762) so it will be disabled with touch swiping that means that you will need to

- [02:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=8766) swiping that means that you will need to click the arrow that's it

- [02:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=8768) click the arrow that's it there is also dark variants with corroso

- [02:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=8771) there is also dark variants with corroso dark

- [02:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=8778) okay that's it's you can also custom transition

- [02:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=8785) such as let's change the transition of painting

- [02:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=8787) painting to do that i think we need to have class

- [02:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=8790) to do that i think we need to have class corrosor item

- [02:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=8792) corrosor item here and then

- [02:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=8798) uh i'm going to have transition like this

- [02:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=8800) this and i also need to set very important

- [02:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=8802) and i also need to set very important for it to work i guess

- [02:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=8804) for it to work i guess so let's refresh and see how the

- [02:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=8806) so let's refresh and see how the transition changes

- [02:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=8814) oh i need to remove fate by the way right

- [02:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=8821) so i need to remove this well let's see

- [02:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=8840) anyway you can look for options

- [02:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=8856) okay so let's move to the next which is close

- [02:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=8859) let's move to the next which is close mode

- [02:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=8872) close button a generic close button for dismissing

- [02:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=8874) a generic close button for dismissing content like modals and alerts

- [02:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=8876) content like modals and alerts okay an example example

- [02:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=8880) okay an example example provide an option to dismiss or close a

- [02:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=8882) provide an option to dismiss or close a component with dot btn close

- [02:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=8885) component with dot btn close default styling is limited but highly

- [02:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=8887) default styling is limited but highly customizable

- [02:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=8889) customizable modify the sas variables to replace the

- [02:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=8891) modify the sas variables to replace the default background image

- [02:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=8894) default background image be sure to include text for screen

- [02:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=8895) be sure to include text for screen readers as we've done with aria label

- [02:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=8912) okay there is a button button close label close

- [02:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=8991) i think we have seen this but let's find an example

- [02:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=9002) okay so it has data dismissed

- [02:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=9016) let's see data dismiss let's make it like this and i wonder if

- [02:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=9018) let's make it like this and i wonder if it will work or not

- [02:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=9021) it will work or not [Music]

- [02:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=9024) [Music] okay not working

- [02:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=9047) you see we can code jquery but i am looking for

- [02:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=9050) jquery but i am looking for a better example

- [02:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=9057) okay so that is data toggle model data targets

- [02:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=9060) targets where is the close

- [02:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=9080) this missing where is the model

- [02:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=9087) okay there is data toggle model which is

- [02:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=9089) which is where

- [02:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=9098) data target point we are here here my model and it dismisses

- [02:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=9105) the parents model probably

- [02:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=9139) and i add this button inside to the model and then i will add another one

- [02:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=9142) model and then i will add another one here

- [02:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=9145) here okay one of them will be inside a model

- [02:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=9147) okay one of them will be inside a model the other one will not

- [02:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=9152) okay so the model is by default

- [02:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=9159) not visible so to make it visible

- [02:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=9168) i need to have my id my model okay like this

- [02:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=9171) okay like this and then i need another button to open

- [02:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=9173) and then i need another button to open it

- [02:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=9183) okay open model or return off online

- [02:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=9215) maybe it is because there is nothing inside it

- [02:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=9244) so opening this model is

- [02:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=9247) this model is not working why

- [02:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=9289) let's see the console if there is any errors no there is no enough

- [02:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=9307) okay we will get into the model example so let's just uh

- [02:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=9309) so let's just uh go there

- [02:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=9310) go there so there is collapse

- [02:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=9313) so there is collapse and there is collapse show

- [02:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=9316) and there is collapse show it is like this so let's try this first

- [02:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=9319) it is like this so let's try this first we will see modules as well

- [02:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=9322) we will see modules as well and let's add some

- [02:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=9324) and let's add some new ones here

- [02:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=9335) okay so we have paragraph you see it has data via struggle

- [02:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=9337) you see it has data via struggle collapse

- [02:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=9339) collapse that is collapse example and

- [02:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=9342) that is collapse example and by here we are giving id

- [02:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=9345) by here we are giving id uh which is here

- [02:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=9347) uh which is here and it is classes collapse

- [02:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=9349) and it is classes collapse and aliexpress false alec underscore

- [02:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=9352) and aliexpress false alec underscore labs example

- [02:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=9355) labs example link with ref and then we have

- [02:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=9358) link with ref and then we have button and button has

- [02:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=9361) button and button has database toggle collapse

- [02:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=9363) database toggle collapse target collapse example

- [02:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=9366) target collapse example okay bottom with ps targets

- [02:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=9377) okay uh one moment it opens it yeah

- [02:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=9381) it opens it yeah what is working however

- [02:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=9384) what is working however you see when we click

- [02:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=9386) you see when we click yeah that's right

- [02:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=9388) yeah that's right [Music]

- [02:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=9389) [Music] okay working great

- [02:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=9399) okay so when we remove here does it still work

- [02:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=9406) i think it is related earlier let's see where we remove area controls what

- [02:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=9408) where we remove area controls what happens

- [02:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=9416) still working so what does audio controls do

- [02:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=9422) maybe it is for screen readers

- [02:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=9438) okay looks like it is not mandatory and there can be multiple

- [02:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=9440) and there can be multiple targets

- [02:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=9451) so for multiple targets there is multi-collapse

- [02:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=9454) there is multi-collapse and it

- [02:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=9456) and it targets the

- [02:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=9458) targets the class as you see

- [02:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=9459) class as you see instead of

- [02:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=9461) instead of id this is the id it is targeting a

- [02:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=9464) id this is the id it is targeting a class and it changes all

- [02:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=9477) okay it's also be shooted area expanded controlling there's

- [02:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=9491) okay so let's test that

- [02:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=9498) toggle version second element both elements here

- [02:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=9500) elements here okay

- [02:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=9512) collapse how it works examples

- [02:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=9523) and then we have drop-downs okay so drop-downs is another uh really

- [02:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=9527) so drop-downs is another uh really important

- [02:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=9529) important aspect of web development

- [02:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=9532) aspect of web development you see drop down link drop down button

- [02:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=9534) you see drop down link drop down button you can have button or you can have link

- [02:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=9538) you can have button or you can have link for button

- [02:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=9544) we just use dropped on item and button secondary

- [02:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=9548) and button secondary i don't see any difference between these

- [02:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=9550) i don't see any difference between these two

- [02:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=9551) two only difference is

- [02:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=9554) only difference is type button

- [02:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=9556) type button and this one is not a type pattern but

- [02:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=9559) and this one is not a type pattern but rolled

- [02:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=9566) um but you see when you do it with graph you can do mouse

- [02:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=9569) you can do mouse for example mouse

- [02:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=9570) for example mouse [Music]

- [02:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=9578) mouse wheeler click like this for button it is not possible but for link it is

- [02:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=9580) it is not possible but for link it is possible

- [02:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=9581) possible to click the mouse wheel so that is the

- [02:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=9583) to click the mouse wheel so that is the difference

- [02:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=9585) difference and then there is also

- [02:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=9587) and then there is also separated buttons with different format

- [02:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=9590) separated buttons with different format split buttons like this

- [02:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=9593) split buttons like this you are just adding uh classes that

- [02:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=9596) you are just adding uh classes that seats drop down toggle speed and

- [02:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=9597) seats drop down toggle speed and dropdown toggle

- [02:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=9600) dropdown toggle that's it and it also has a

- [02:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=9602) that's it and it also has a target

- [02:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=9604) target database toggle which takes the id of

- [02:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=9632) okay so there's bait i think it is taking from the book btn group

- [02:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=9636) taking from the book btn group so we just provide

- [02:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=9646) class names we don't provide any id and since they're inside in the same

- [02:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=9648) and since they're inside in the same group it just works like this

- [02:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=9652) group it just works like this they can be linked

- [02:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=9654) they can be linked you see action is another button here

- [02:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=9657) you see action is another button here it can be anything

- [02:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=9658) it can be anything and then there is a toggle drop down

- [02:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=9661) and then there is a toggle drop down like here

- [02:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=9663) like here and there are also other links

- [02:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=9671) and it is the drop down item i think i can give this different

- [02:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=9677) styling as well such as this one you see

- [02:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=9688) dark drop down like this and you can also have

- [02:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=9690) and you can also have navigation bar with now bar number

- [02:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=9692) navigation bar with now bar number expand a

- [02:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=9694) expand a large number dark

- [02:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=9696) large number dark bg dark you see

- [02:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=9698) bg dark you see and the

- [02:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=9700) and the link

- [02:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=9702) link at the beginning then you have a drop

- [02:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=9704) at the beginning then you have a drop down here so this is the first link

- [02:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=9706) down here so this is the first link here

- [02:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=9707) here now we have button here

- [02:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=9756) want to set its responsiveness with brake

- [02:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=9758) responsiveness with brake breakers

- [02:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=9760) breakers i think it was inside

- [02:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=9763) i think it was inside yeah breakpoints it's inside layout

- [02:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=9766) yeah breakpoints it's inside layout you can also have direction like this

- [02:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=9772) drop right like this not that

- [02:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=9774) not that menu items

- [02:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=9776) menu items active

- [02:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=9783) disabled menu alignments responsive alignments

- [02:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=9788) um write it up etc

- [02:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=9791) write it up etc you can also have

- [02:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=9793) you can also have lines like this

- [02:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=9800) many contents so you can have headers like here drop down headers

- [02:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=9803) like here drop down headers to either text

- [02:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=9810) like here forms inside inside dropdown i think you can even have form

- [02:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=9815) so let's

- [02:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=9815) let's change

- [02:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=9817) change a drop down

- [02:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=9819) a drop down so there's a drop down item

- [02:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=9831) yeah i will put this inside drop down item here

- [02:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=9833) item here so let's see what happens

- [02:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=9848) yeah not working so for it to work

- [02:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=9863) this is wrote on many what's how do we make it stroke download

- [02:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=9879) okay so there is drop down menu

- [02:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=9916) okay they didn't uh [Music]

- [02:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=9918) [Music] pro

- [02:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=9920) pro put a proper example

- [02:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=9951) so they have written it inside the class drop down

- [02:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=9954) let's test it okay we have

- [02:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=9995) let's put it here so this is inside

- [02:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=9997) so this is inside which

- [02:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=9999) which example

- [02:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=10018) yeah here another action something here separate

- [02:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=10021) another action something here separate the thing it is not working

- [02:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=10050) okay let's figure this out how to make it work

- [02:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=10069) there is drop down menu and inside it is lee

- [02:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=10081) okay so far our examples are not working so

- [02:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=10175) so when we click this drop down it is supposed to expand this

- [02:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=10178) supposed to expand this yeah example less range

- [02:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=10188) yeah x1 is working and here i would like to have a menu

- [02:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=10191) and here i would like to have a menu i mean

- [02:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=10192) i mean f4 so when i put this

- [02:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=10196) f4 so when i put this inside here

- [02:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=10216) so we have only here and it is

- [02:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=10219) and it is expand here

- [02:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=10243) i will remove this so this is a drop down menu and i will

- [02:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=10246) so this is a drop down menu and i will [Music]

- [02:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=10248) [Music] remove okay let's test it out

- [02:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=10252) remove okay let's test it out no

- [02:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=10254) no let's remove this as well

- [02:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=10264) oh now what okay so i had to remove that drop down many

- [02:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=10266) so i had to remove that drop down many thing so inside lee i am able to put f4

- [02:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=10270) thing so inside lee i am able to put f4 like this

- [02:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=10272) like this everything is working and they are

- [02:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=10274) everything is working and they are separated with

- [02:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=10278) separated with the same

- [02:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=10281) the same drop-down divider

- [02:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=10283) drop-down divider then i i can have other drop-down items

- [02:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=10286) then i i can have other drop-down items like this yeah

- [02:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=10287) like this yeah they are fully compatible with

- [02:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=10290) they are fully compatible with like glass okay this is a good example

- [02:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=10299) so even inside drop down you can even have a form to submit

- [02:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=10302) have a form to submit that is great

- [02:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=10304) that is great you see how uh it is easier to work with

- [02:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=10308) you see how uh it is easier to work with uh

- [02:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=10314) bootstrap when i add this to my uh generic

- [02:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=10316) generic page

- [02:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=10317) page let's see how it looks

- [02:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=10323) it's looking like this completely different completely

- [02:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=10325) completely different completely unrelated

- [02:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=10327) unrelated and completely bad

- [02:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=10333) okay so what else there is that you would like to learn

- [02:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=10335) would like to learn drop down options

- [02:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=10338) drop down options of sets

- [02:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=10339) of sets you see with offset you can

- [02:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=10341) you see with offset you can set it to be under here there is an

- [02:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=10344) set it to be under here there is an offset here follow my

- [02:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=10346) offset here follow my mouse or here

- [02:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=10350) mouse or here there is also auto close behavior some

- [02:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=10352) there is also auto close behavior some of them can be

- [02:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=10373) so there is clickable outside it uses drop down toggle lighting here so when i

- [02:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=10376) drop down toggle lighting here so when i add

- [02:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=10377) add drop down toggle

- [02:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=10383) no not that where do we edit

- [02:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=10403) i don't see how to close inside to the example this is

- [02:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=10405) example this is oh i see

- [02:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=10406) oh i see so you see you add a

- [02:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=10408) so you see you add a database auto close outside

- [02:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=10412) database auto close outside so by default it is autoclosure working

- [02:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=10416) so by default it is autoclosure working and when i change it let's see

- [02:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=10420) and when i change it let's see so it is here

- [02:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=10422) so it is here it has database toggle collapse it

- [02:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=10424) it has database toggle collapse it targets now breakdown here

- [02:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=10428) targets now breakdown here audio controls toggle navigation and

- [02:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=10431) audio controls toggle navigation and when we hit auto close outside

- [02:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=10454) so auto class

- [02:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=10469) oh there is insight maybe i need to set it inside let's

- [02:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=10471) maybe i need to set it inside let's refresh

- [02:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=10473) refresh okay still not working

- [02:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=10477) okay still not working oh when i click inside now it is not

- [02:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=10479) oh when i click inside now it is not also closing so it's

- [02:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=10481) also closing so it's auto close it on the outside

- [02:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=10485) auto close it on the outside and then there's auto close force yeah i

- [02:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=10487) and then there's auto close force yeah i need to set it as false

- [02:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=10518) not here but [Music]

- [03:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=10829) and you can also have auto close behaviors

- [03:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=10834) yeah all right

- [03:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=10842) all right so let's continue with

- [03:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=10843) let's continue with this group

- [03:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=10852) list group list groups are a flexible and powerful

- [03:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=10854) list groups are a flexible and powerful component for displaying a series of

- [03:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=10856) component for displaying a series of content

- [03:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=10858) content modify and extend them to support just

- [03:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=10860) modify and extend them to support just about any content within

- [03:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=10863) about any content within okay

- [03:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=10863) okay [Music]

- [03:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=10865) [Music] basic example

- [03:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=10867) basic example the most basic list group is an

- [03:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=10869) the most basic list group is an unordered list with list items and the

- [03:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=10871) unordered list with list items and the proper classes

- [03:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=10873) proper classes build upon it with the options that

- [03:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=10874) build upon it with the options that follow or with your own css as needed

- [03:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=10878) follow or with your own css as needed all right so let's compare the

- [03:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=10880) all right so let's compare the uh boosts of

- [03:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=10881) uh boosts of this group with uh html list

- [03:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=10885) this group with uh html list so it uses basic html ul unordered list

- [03:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=10889) so it uses basic html ul unordered list and li list element

- [03:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=10892) and li list element so let's compare both of them

- [03:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=10897) so let's compare both of them okay this is the regular list how it

- [03:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=10899) okay this is the regular list how it looks and this is the least group of

- [03:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=10901) looks and this is the least group of bootstrap okay

- [03:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=10909) and you can set active items uh with adding uh active

- [03:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=10911) adding uh active tag like this

- [03:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=10914) tag like this so

- [03:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=10915) so let's test it as well

- [03:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=10924) okay [Music]

- [03:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=10932) oh by the way there is no active here it is a class of octave

- [03:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=10935) is a class of octave yeah now you see it is differently

- [03:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=10937) yeah now you see it is differently colored

- [03:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=10939) colored you can also have disabled items and it

- [03:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=10942) you can also have disabled items and it has a disabled class

- [03:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=10945) has a disabled class there's also links and buttons if we

- [03:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=10947) there's also links and buttons if we want them so

- [03:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=10948) want them so for links links

- [03:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=10951) for links links you can still use this group and you

- [03:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=10953) you can still use this group and you don't even need to use

- [03:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=10955) don't even need to use ul and li

- [03:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=10958) ul and li you just

- [03:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=10960) you just do a regular div

- [03:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=10963) do a regular div and change class to this group and

- [03:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=10966) and change class to this group and regular graph

- [03:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=10968) regular graph a item and you just add this group item

- [03:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=10972) a item and you just add this group item and this group item action

- [03:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=10975) and this group item action so

- [03:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=10976) so it's automatically

- [03:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=10978) it's automatically changing it to this group and you can

- [03:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=10981) changing it to this group and you can even click even

- [03:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=10983) even click even you can click them as well

- [03:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=10985) you can click them as well you can use buttons too

- [03:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=10987) you can use buttons too same

- [03:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=10989) same and there is also flash which to remove

- [03:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=10992) and there is also flash which to remove assemble those on the corners

- [03:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=10995) assemble those on the corners so if we add this

- [03:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=10997) so if we add this to our excluded plus

- [03:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=11004) it becomes something like this here and you can also have numbers for

- [03:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=11008) here and you can also have numbers for numbers we just add telescope numbered

- [03:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=11010) numbers we just add telescope numbered class

- [03:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=11011) class it will be automatically numbered

- [03:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=11014) it will be automatically numbered or not

- [03:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=11021) i think numbered works only on uh action this could not on div

- [03:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=11024) action this could not on div so let's test yeah

- [03:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=11027) so let's test yeah one two three four five and the number

- [03:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=11029) one two three four five and the number is not applicable

- [03:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=11031) is not applicable copy

- [03:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=11032) copy one

- [03:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=11034) one you can also have

- [03:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=11036) you can also have you see this is a notification with

- [03:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=11040) you see this is a notification with um

- [03:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=11045) badges yeah this look this is looking awesome

- [03:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=11047) yeah this look this is looking awesome actually

- [03:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=11048) actually so let's copy and paste it so it's a

- [03:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=11051) so let's copy and paste it so it's a ordered list

- [03:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=11053) ordered list uh you see this group number

- [03:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=11056) uh you see this group number um

- [03:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=11060) a memory refresh yeah it's looking like this

- [03:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=11063) refresh yeah it's looking like this subheading

- [03:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=11064) subheading text and batch

- [03:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=11067) text and batch of course if you want it to be

- [03:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=11069) of course if you want it to be taking small size you can add coldly or

- [03:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=11073) taking small size you can add coldly or width

- [03:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=11074) width as usual like this

- [03:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=11078) as usual like this and you can have horizontal support

- [03:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=11080) and you can have horizontal support horizontal

- [03:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=11082) horizontal and let's group horizontal like this

- [03:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=11085) and let's group horizontal like this it is looking like a table

- [03:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=11087) it is looking like a table and it also supports contextual items

- [03:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=11090) and it also supports contextual items like uh this group item primary

- [03:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=11093) like uh this group item primary secondary

- [03:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=11094) secondary so this is just basically adding a

- [03:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=11097) so this is just basically adding a colored scheme to it

- [03:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=11100) colored scheme to it it can be applied for anything

- [03:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=11102) it can be applied for anything pages

- [03:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=11104) pages custom content here this is also looking

- [03:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=11107) great so this is a regular div but with this

- [03:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=11109) so this is a regular div but with this group

- [03:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=11114) it has just very content between

- [03:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=11117) just very content between this group item heading with h5

- [03:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=11120) this group item heading with h5 and the small something

- [03:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=11139) okay for this uh three days ago to be

- [03:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=11142) three days ago to be visible here

- [03:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=11143) visible here i think it uses justify content between

- [03:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=11146) i think it uses justify content between when i

- [03:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=11147) when i change it

- [03:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=11149) change it yeah it is becoming like this you see

- [03:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=11152) yeah it is becoming like this you see so justify content between means

- [03:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=11155) so justify content between means left and right ally

- [03:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=11157) left and right ally alignment and i will also add some

- [03:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=11161) alignment and i will also add some column

- [03:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=11162) column like this

- [03:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=11164) like this yeah

- [03:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=11166) yeah i can also make this like five

- [03:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=11204) so you can even have checkboxes and radios as lists

- [03:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=11206) radios as lists you see input form check inputs

- [03:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=11209) you see input form check inputs with a margin

- [03:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=11223) okay but you see when i click this label it's

- [03:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=11225) but you see when i click this label it's not checking to

- [03:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=11247) okay and here if i make it

- [03:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=11249) if i make it like this the fourth one

- [03:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=11252) like this the fourth one now it is checkable with uh you see text

- [03:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=11255) now it is checkable with uh you see text as well

- [03:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=11257) as well okay and yeah that's it

- [03:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=11288) for disabled we just had disabled uh class

- [03:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=11295) exam buttons flash

- [03:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=11296) flash okay

- [03:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=11305) and for horizontal i wouldn't use horizontally it's exactly looking like a

- [03:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=11308) horizontally it's exactly looking like a table

- [03:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=11309) table so when uh when we add something like

- [03:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=11312) so when uh when we add something like this it will be much more

- [03:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=11314) this it will be much more understandable i just added a single

- [03:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=11318) understandable i just added a single item and you see instead of vertical

- [03:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=11320) item and you see instead of vertical like this it is horizontal like this

- [03:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=11322) like this it is horizontal like this nothing else

- [03:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=11324) nothing else and

- [03:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=11326) and contextual classes

- [03:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=11329) contextual classes so these contextual classes exist with

- [03:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=11332) so these contextual classes exist with many of the bootstrap

- [03:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=11334) many of the bootstrap classes

- [03:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=11339) okay coming with additive assistive technologies with badges

- [03:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=11359) okay yeah and then there is models

- [03:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=11362) and then there is models and models are also really cool and

- [03:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=11367) and models are also really cool and normally hard to achieve features

- [03:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=11370) normally hard to achieve features component you can say

- [03:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=11373) component you can say okay

- [03:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=11380) modal use bootstrap's javascript modal plugin

- [03:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=11383) use bootstrap's javascript modal plugin to add dialogs to your site for light

- [03:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=11385) to add dialogs to your site for light boxes user notifications or completely

- [03:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=11387) boxes user notifications or completely custom content so this requires

- [03:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=11390) custom content so this requires javascript and we already have that

- [03:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=11393) javascript and we already have that in our

- [03:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=11399) layout page how it works

- [03:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=11401) how it works before getting started with bootstrap's

- [03:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=11403) before getting started with bootstrap's modal component be sure to read the

- [03:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=11405) modal component be sure to read the following as our menu options have

- [03:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=11406) following as our menu options have recently changed

- [03:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=11409) recently changed modals are built with html css and

- [03:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=11412) modals are built with html css and javascript

- [03:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=11413) javascript they're positioned over everything else

- [03:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=11415) they're positioned over everything else in the document and remove scroll from

- [03:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=11417) in the document and remove scroll from the body so that modal content scrolls

- [03:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=11419) the body so that modal content scrolls instead

- [03:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=11421) instead clicking on the modal backdrop will

- [03:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=11423) clicking on the modal backdrop will automatically close the modal

- [03:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=11426) automatically close the modal bootstrap only supports one modal window

- [03:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=11428) bootstrap only supports one modal window at a time

- [03:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=11429) at a time nested modals aren't supported as we

- [03:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=11431) nested modals aren't supported as we believe them to be poor user experiences

- [03:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=11434) believe them to be poor user experiences so that is how models are closed with

- [03:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=11437) so that is how models are closed with close button because there is only

- [03:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=11439) close button because there is only single model

- [03:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=11440) single model at a time in a page therefore it will

- [03:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=11443) at a time in a page therefore it will close that one

- [03:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=11445) close that one experiences

- [03:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=11447) experiences modals use position fixed which can

- [03:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=11449) modals use position fixed which can sometimes be a bit particular about its

- [03:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=11451) sometimes be a bit particular about its rendering

- [03:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=11453) rendering whenever possible place your modal html

- [03:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=11456) whenever possible place your modal html in a top level position to avoid

- [03:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=11457) in a top level position to avoid potential interference from other

- [03:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=11459) potential interference from other elements

- [03:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=11460) elements you'll likely run into issues when

- [03:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=11462) you'll likely run into issues when nesting a dot modal within another fixed

- [03:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=11464) nesting a dot modal within another fixed element

- [03:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=11466) element once again due to position fixed there

- [03:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=11469) once again due to position fixed there are some caveats with using modals on

- [03:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=11471) are some caveats with using modals on mobile devices

- [03:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=11473) mobile devices see our browser support docs for details

- [03:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=11476) see our browser support docs for details due to how html5 defines its semantics

- [03:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=11480) due to how html5 defines its semantics the autofocus html attribute has no

- [03:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=11483) the autofocus html attribute has no effect in bootstrap models

- [03:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=11485) effect in bootstrap models to achieve the same effect use some

- [03:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=11487) to achieve the same effect use some custom javascript

- [03:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=11490) custom javascript okay

- [03:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=11495) okay example so let's start with an example

- [03:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=11503) okay so it starts with the model top index minus one

- [03:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=11505) index minus one why do we need top index i'm not sure

- [03:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=11507) why do we need top index i'm not sure and inside that we have model dialog and

- [03:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=11509) and inside that we have model dialog and we have model content

- [03:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=11512) we have model content and inside model content you can have

- [03:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=11513) and inside model content you can have model header

- [03:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=11515) model header which has a

- [03:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=11518) which has a button which closes the model

- [03:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=11522) button which closes the model since there is only single model at a

- [03:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=11524) since there is only single model at a time it closes that one

- [03:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=11526) time it closes that one you can have model body

- [03:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=11528) you can have model body and model footage

- [03:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=11530) and model footage and inside that model you can have

- [03:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=11532) and inside that model you can have anything you can have forms

- [03:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=11534) anything you can have forms uh other things

- [03:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=11537) uh other things okay

- [03:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=11539) okay why i don't see it ah i don't see it

- [03:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=11541) why i don't see it ah i don't see it because that model is not visible right

- [03:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=11543) because that model is not visible right now so i need to have a button to open

- [03:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=11546) now so i need to have a button to open it

- [03:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=11548) it so to open that model i need to have a

- [03:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=11551) so to open that model i need to have a button actually i have a button for

- [03:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=11553) button actually i have a button for opening model

- [03:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=11555) opening model which is here

- [03:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=11558) which is here okay it doesn't open

- [03:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=11577) so here and yeah i need an id to trigger it so i

- [03:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=11581) and yeah i need an id to trigger it so i leave it with this

- [03:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=11583) leave it with this and now it will work

- [03:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=11586) and now it will work okay now this is working

- [03:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=11589) okay now this is working and i can close i can click save i can

- [03:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=11592) and i can close i can click save i can close

- [03:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=11594) close there is some

- [03:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=11595) there is some fading

- [03:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=11608) on fading you see with painting it has a background fading

- [03:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=11610) background fading so i just need to add that

- [03:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=11612) so i just need to add that my model here

- [03:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=11620) and when i refresh my page you see the background is faded

- [03:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=11627) okay static background what is that oh it means that you can click uh

- [03:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=11630) oh it means that you can click uh uh

- [03:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=11632) uh other

- [03:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=11633) other places than the model and it will have

- [03:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=11637) places than the model and it will have um [Music]

- [03:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=11641) [Music] click effect so you see in this one when

- [03:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=11644) click effect so you see in this one when i click somewhere else it is

- [03:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=11645) i click somewhere else it is automatically closing

- [03:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=11647) automatically closing however if i want to prevent that i add

- [03:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=11649) however if i want to prevent that i add as

- [03:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=11656) database backdrop as static and now

- [03:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=11658) and now it won't get closer when i click

- [03:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=11660) it won't get closer when i click somewhere else you see

- [03:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=11661) somewhere else you see it will get close without the close

- [03:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=11663) it will get close without the close button

- [03:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=11665) button scrolling long content so you can have a

- [03:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=11667) scrolling long content so you can have a low content model as well

- [03:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=11672) and you can also have

- [03:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=11674) you can also have a scroll bar bar having

- [03:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=11677) a scroll bar bar having a scrollable

- [03:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=11679) a scrollable model

- [03:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=11681) model so since our content is not that big it

- [03:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=11683) so since our content is not that big it wouldn't have a pro

- [03:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=11684) wouldn't have a pro [Music]

- [03:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=11686) [Music] effect probably

- [03:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=11688) effect probably yeah

- [03:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=11689) yeah well to be able to see that

- [03:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=11693) well to be able to see that i think i will just add

- [03:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=11697) i think i will just add some style

- [03:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=11699) some style page 1000 pixel

- [03:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=11701) page 1000 pixel so it will take 1000 pixels

- [03:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=11720) so this didn't work so let's just expand it with some copy paste

- [03:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=11735) and then go to paste

- [03:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=11755) oh i need to set it to model dialog scrollable

- [03:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=11757) scrollable is making an entire page scrollable like

- [03:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=11760) is making an entire page scrollable like this

- [03:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=11766) if i make it like this it will just be model dialogue not scrollable

- [03:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=11796) let's check the source code so it is going to start

- [03:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=11800) so it is going to start an example model scrollable which is

- [03:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=11802) an example model scrollable which is bash

- [03:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=11852) oh i know i know i know i know you see you need to

- [03:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=11855) you see you need to make this dialogue window scrollable

- [03:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=11857) make this dialogue window scrollable [Music]

- [03:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=11858) [Music] not uh the other thing

- [03:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=11862) not uh the other thing so

- [03:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=11868) yeah now it is working okay okay and

- [03:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=11870) okay and what else there is static drop one that

- [03:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=11872) what else there is static drop one that looks explodable

- [03:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=11875) looks explodable and varying model content what is this

- [03:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=11884) so it says that

- [03:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=11899) so there are buttons you see this

- [03:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=11900) you see this database whatever

- [03:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=11902) database whatever with database whatever

- [03:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=11905) with database whatever we are able to change

- [03:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=11915) let's copy and paste this to see so with different buttons we are able to

- [03:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=11917) so with different buttons we are able to change the openness message

- [03:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=11920) change the openness message there is message text from control

- [03:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=11923) there is message text from control [Music]

- [03:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=11930) okay let's make this double pads

- [03:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=11948) what is this being written recipient recipient name

- [03:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=11973) you see there is some id maybe this no

- [03:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=11980) oh it is not working this here so there's something extra

- [03:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=11982) there's something extra i see there is a javascript

- [03:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=11985) i see there is a javascript which adds a model listeners

- [03:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=11989) which adds a model listeners from this

- [03:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=11990) from this listener it is getting the whatever

- [03:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=11992) listener it is getting the whatever attribute

- [03:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=11993) attribute so when i add this to end of my page

- [03:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=11997) so when i add this to end of my page it should just work

- [03:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=12001) it should just work so it will get this

- [03:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=12007) and then it will add an event listener so it will be leave for entire page

- [03:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=12012) so it will be leave for entire page and

- [03:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=12013) and yeah now working

- [03:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=12016) yeah now working so it is adding a listener as show bs

- [03:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=12019) so it is adding a listener as show bs model

- [03:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=12031) so this is an event that is being triggered by

- [03:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=12039) i think bootstrap okay

- [03:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=12044) i think this would work with click as well

- [03:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=12045) well but i need to get there in that case the

- [03:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=12047) but i need to get there in that case the buttons

- [03:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=12049) buttons so let's try that actually so these are

- [03:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=12052) so let's try that actually so these are button

- [03:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=12060) and for this button i will add another class

- [03:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=12062) class for example gg1

- [03:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=12065) for example gg1 okay there is no such class of course in

- [03:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=12067) okay there is no such class of course in bootstrap

- [03:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=12068) bootstrap but i am going to add all buttons with

- [03:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=12071) but i am going to add all buttons with gg1 class

- [03:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=12073) gg1 class so simply

- [03:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=12080) by the way it requires get element single element ic

- [03:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=12083) single element ic so it wouldn't work yeah

- [03:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=12090) maybe this can work so let's try that

- [03:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=12139) it is probably not working because probably

- [03:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=12140) probably this click event is overridden by

- [03:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=12144) this click event is overridden by bootstrap

- [03:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=12156) yeah i let's put a full class here maybe that will fix it

- [03:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=12160) class here maybe that will fix it yeah this is the full class

- [03:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=12162) yeah this is the full class i'm not sure let's try it

- [03:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=12171) what what about if we give an id for this id

- [03:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=12173) this id test gg1

- [03:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=12192) yeah it's definitely overrated therefore not working

- [03:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=12201) probably this event this click event is already overridden by

- [03:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=12204) already overridden by bootstrap therefore it is not working

- [03:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=12215) i can have another button with same name but this time i won't

- [03:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=12217) with same name but this time i won't have database toggle

- [03:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=12220) have database toggle it will be like this

- [03:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=12223) it will be like this so let's see i think this will work

- [03:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=12230) oh and this is not opening the model of course

- [03:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=12231) course but we can't even see it

- [03:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=12234) but we can't even see it [Music]

- [03:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=12235) [Music] anyway let's reverse back

- [03:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=12239) anyway let's reverse back so that it will work

- [03:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=12248) okay yeah uh toggle between models open first

- [03:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=12251) uh toggle between models open first model open second module

- [03:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=12253) model open second module is working

- [03:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=12255) is working so in the seconds model click we just

- [03:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=12258) so in the seconds model click we just opened another logo here

- [03:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=12260) opened another logo here then we can have change animation

- [03:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=12268) uh fate transforms go transform modern dialogue

- [03:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=12275) it's like i said there is also dynamic hates

- [03:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=12284) okay large model like this large model there's also full screen model

- [03:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=12286) there's also full screen model yeah like this

- [03:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=12288) yeah like this you see

- [03:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=12290) you see uh full screen with e6

- [03:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=12300) so you can also set full second band to be delegate

- [03:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=12302) be delegate for example

- [03:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=12304) for example not yet

- [03:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=12306) not yet not yet

- [03:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=12307) not yet yes

- [03:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=12308) yes if your screen is below certain size you

- [03:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=12311) if your screen is below certain size you can trigger full screen model

- [03:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=12314) can trigger full screen model and how it behaves when we make it okay

- [03:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=12317) and how it behaves when we make it okay so it is

- [03:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=12318) so it is it is by default with the size of

- [03:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=12322) it is by default with the size of bootstrap yeah

- [03:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=12328) and okay it looks cool responsible screen models are generated

- [03:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=12330) responsible screen models are generated like this yeah

- [03:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=12336) okay these are not very important there's trouble

- [03:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=12338) there's trouble that's okay

- [03:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=12360) let's see what's in one yeah

- [03:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=12369) uh example some modal components examples small components

- [03:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=12373) examples small components okay we don't need static backdrop is

- [03:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=12375) okay we don't need static backdrop is important

- [03:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=12377) important to know

- [03:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=12378) to know you see you just need to know how can

- [03:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=12380) you see you just need to know how can you set

- [03:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=12381) you set you can set a

- [03:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=12384) you can set a model that when you click somewhere else

- [03:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=12386) model that when you click somewhere else it won't get disappeared

- [03:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=12389) it won't get disappeared and you can also have you can also

- [03:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=12392) and you can also have you can also enable

- [03:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=12393) enable [Music]

- [03:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=12401) scroll bar these are important things to know

- [03:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=12407) there's also two tips and pop oh wow

- [03:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=12409) pop oh wow you see these have tooltips and

- [03:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=12412) you see these have tooltips and pop hours

- [03:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=12414) pop hours for that we just add a tooltip test and

- [03:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=12417) for that we just add a tooltip test and a tooltip

- [03:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=12419) a tooltip and for pop over we just add pop over

- [03:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=12422) and for pop over we just add pop over test

- [03:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=12424) test so here's

- [03:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=12426) so here's this trigger pop over title which is it

- [03:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=12428) this trigger pop over title which is it is also a model

- [03:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=12431) is also a model now we just missed this for a while

- [03:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=12434) now we just missed this for a while but there's also grid and other things

- [03:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=12436) but there's also grid and other things here we haven't done this yet

- [03:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=12438) here we haven't done this yet so let's copy and paste this

- [03:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=12440) so let's copy and paste this [Music]

- [03:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=12455) i need [Music]

- [03:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=12457) [Music] oh this is just a model body so just

- [03:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=12460) oh this is just a model body so just replace our model body

- [03:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=12463) replace our model body actually we can append it to our model

- [03:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=12465) actually we can append it to our model body yeah

- [03:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=12467) body yeah so let's append it to our model body

- [03:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=12469) so let's append it to our model body here

- [03:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=12471) here like this

- [03:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=12474) like this and when i refresh

- [03:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=12477) and when i refresh i will see now it is available

- [03:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=12503) for this we need publish mean yeah you must include proper mean

- [03:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=12511) or usable some bundle i think they are already using bootstrap bundle

- [03:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=12514) already using bootstrap bundle so why is this not working

- [03:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=12546) okay it says pop over body content is set this attribute

- [03:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=12562) so do we have an error or something in console

- [03:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=12564) console no also

- [03:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=12565) no also tooltip is also not working

- [03:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=12602) yeah this is well let's check our

- [03:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=12608) stateless layout and we have bootstrap main

- [03:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=12611) and we have bootstrap main we have lots of icons

- [03:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=12614) we have lots of icons and we have bootstrap bundled mean yeah

- [03:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=12616) and we have bootstrap bundled mean yeah we have all of them

- [03:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=12618) we have all of them so why is this not working

- [03:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=12631) using the grids this is the regular grid nothing

- [03:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=12633) nothing new

- [03:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=12649) oh it says that tooltips are opting for performance reasons so you must

- [03:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=12650) performance reasons so you must initialize them

- [03:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=12652) initialize them so they are not initialized to be able

- [03:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=12655) so they are not initialized to be able to initialize them

- [03:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=12657) to initialize them i need to have

- [03:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=12661) this javascript code at the end of my page

- [03:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=12665) javascript code at the end of my page for example here

- [03:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=12667) for example here so it will get

- [03:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=12669) so it will get all tooltip and then trigger them yeah

- [03:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=12673) all tooltip and then trigger them yeah like here

- [03:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=12688) refresh still not working maybe i need

- [03:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=12704) maybe i need to check source code of this page

- [03:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=12732) database toggle tooltip so what is our database toggle

- [03:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=12741) we have database node we don't have database toggle

- [03:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=12743) database toggle we have class

- [03:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=12746) we have class so let's ask data yes toggle

- [03:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=12758) oh not this [Music]

- [03:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=12766) oh i need to edit here so it's mandatory edge

- [03:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=12768) so it's mandatory edge then

- [03:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=12774) let's open it yes i'm not working

- [03:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=12796) let's add this to not inside the model but here and let's see what happens

- [03:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=12863) okay there is an easier called self-executing code like this

- [03:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=12866) self-executing code like this start executing function actually

- [03:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=12870) start executing function actually so let's test it out

- [03:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=12915) okay let's try this so this will get executed when the

- [03:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=12918) so this will get executed when the document is ready

- [03:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=12926) not working we have included also bundle

- [03:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=12931) um so therefore it should have

- [03:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=12934) so therefore it should have tooltip as well

- [03:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=12937) tooltip as well let's see what this page uses as a

- [03:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=12941) let's see what this page uses as a javascript bundle

- [03:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=12947) here actually it is the same bundle we have i

- [03:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=12950) actually it is the same bundle we have i think

- [03:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=12955) like here let's

- [03:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=12957) let's reload it

- [03:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=12969) lock switch distribute yes both swap boundaries here

- [03:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=12972) boundaries here do they have any others ps

- [03:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=12975) do they have any others ps document search and document mean

- [03:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=13024) okay let's check our

- [03:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=13026) let's check our page sort

- [03:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=13071) maybe i need to add bs that i cannot just stop the table yes

- [03:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=13098) it did become slow somehow i can appreciate yeah now working

- [03:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=13101) appreciate yeah now working and

- [03:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=13102) and yeah

- [03:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=13104) yeah so

- [03:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=13106) so this is the correct way

- [03:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=13108) this is the correct way you need to add database toggle tooltip

- [03:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=13110) you need to add database toggle tooltip to your objects and it will start

- [03:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=13112) to your objects and it will start working

- [03:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=13114) working so

- [03:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=13116) so um

- [03:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=13117) um you see it they use this and on our

- [03:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=13120) you see it they use this and on our model

- [03:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=13122) model where is our tooltip

- [03:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=13127) okay here database toggle bluetip so this one

- [03:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=13129) database toggle bluetip so this one works

- [03:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=13131) works and for other tooltip

- [03:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=13137) which is here i also need to add database solo tooltip

- [03:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=13140) database solo tooltip and now it will work

- [03:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=13145) you see this is still not working so for pop

- [03:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=13147) this is still not working so for pop over

- [03:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=13151) do we need anything else let's check it out too

- [03:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=13156) um so for pop overs

- [03:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=13160) so for pop overs we need some yeah

- [03:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=13162) we need some yeah we need an initializer for pop

- [03:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=13182) let's add this inside stuff executing function

- [03:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=13185) stuff executing function why the code is not working i don't know

- [03:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=13187) why the code is not working i don't know but it's not working

- [03:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=13190) but it's not working so let's try this

- [03:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=13195) yeah so

- [03:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=13206) to enable pop over let's see what they suggest

- [03:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=13219) it's something like this why did they have some

- [03:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=13221) have some um

- [03:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=13223) um by the way this is like this or there's

- [03:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=13225) by the way this is like this or there's bs i don't know

- [03:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=13236) no so where is the pop over

- [03:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=13242) oh it is database content [Music]

- [03:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=13253) yeah i need to add add this to that otherwise it won't work

- [03:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=13256) that otherwise it won't work so for initialization

- [03:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=13264) okay now it should work so let's refresh

- [03:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=13274) okay so how to enable initialize

- [03:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=13281) both strap tool [Music]

- [03:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=13283) [Music] and pop

- [03:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=13284) and pop overs properly yeah this is also

- [03:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=13286) overs properly yeah this is also important

- [03:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=13289) important let's see the correct wording of

- [03:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=13291) let's see the correct wording of initialize

- [03:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=13308) okay and using the creates the greatest regular grids there is

- [03:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=13310) the greatest regular grids there is nothing different running model content

- [03:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=13314) nothing different running model content yeah we already have that

- [03:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=13319) okay um

- [03:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=13331) yeah this is nothing fancy here okay

- [03:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=13341) okay let's continue with knows and taps

- [03:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=13344) knows and taps so

- [03:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=13349) navs and tabs documentation and examples for how to

- [03:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=13351) documentation and examples for how to use bootstraps included navigation

- [03:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=13353) use bootstraps included navigation components so this is related to

- [03:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=13355) components so this is related to navigation

- [03:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=13358) navigation nav

- [03:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=13360) nav navigation available in bootstrap share

- [03:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=13362) navigation available in bootstrap share general markup and styles from the

- [03:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=13364) general markup and styles from the base.nav class to the active and

- [03:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=13366) base.nav class to the active and disabled states

- [03:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=13368) disabled states swap modifier classes to switch between

- [03:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=13370) swap modifier classes to switch between each style

- [03:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=13372) each style the base dot nav component is built with

- [03:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=13375) the base dot nav component is built with flexbox and provide a strong foundation

- [03:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=13377) flexbox and provide a strong foundation for building all types of navigation

- [03:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=13379) for building all types of navigation components

- [03:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=13381) components it includes some style overrides for

- [03:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=13383) it includes some style overrides for working with lists some link padding for

- [03:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=13385) working with lists some link padding for larger hit areas and basic disabled

- [03:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=13387) larger hit areas and basic disabled styling

- [03:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=13389) styling okay

- [03:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=13391) okay there is an important thing the base dot

- [03:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=13393) there is an important thing the base dot nav component does not include any dot

- [03:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=13396) nav component does not include any dot active state

- [03:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=13397) active state the following examples include the class

- [03:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=13399) the following examples include the class mainly to demonstrate that this

- [03:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=13401) mainly to demonstrate that this particular class does not trigger any

- [03:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=13403) particular class does not trigger any special styling

- [03:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=13405) special styling to convey the active state to assistive

- [03:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=13407) to convey the active state to assistive technologies use the aria current

- [03:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=13409) technologies use the aria current attribute using the page value for

- [03:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=13411) attribute using the page value for current page or true for the current

- [03:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=13413) current page or true for the current item in a set

- [03:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=13415) item in a set okay so there is an easy

- [03:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=13417) okay so there is an easy example let's start with that

- [03:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=13432) okay you see our navigation is here

- [03:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=13435) navigation is here since it is not big uh

- [03:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=13437) since it is not big uh it doesn't change

- [03:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=13440) it doesn't change any

- [03:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=13448) styling when we made the page a lower screen reservation oh

- [03:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=13450) screen reservation oh yeah it is just getting to the next line

- [03:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=13452) yeah it is just getting to the next line so it is not supporting

- [03:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=13459) mobile friendliness right now because it's a simple one let's continue to see

- [03:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=13462) it's a simple one let's continue to see so here it has a ul class navigation

- [03:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=13466) so here it has a ul class navigation and an i class now item each item and

- [03:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=13469) and an i class now item each item and inside each item we have a link

- [03:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=13473) inside each item we have a link like this active link and other links

- [03:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=13475) like this active link and other links are regular but i don't see any

- [03:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=13477) are regular but i don't see any difference between active and other

- [03:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=13478) difference between active and other links

- [03:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=13485) um so you can also have a now and now class like this

- [03:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=13487) class like this it is looking exactly same

- [03:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=13497) and let's continue with available styles there's just for content centers there's

- [03:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=13499) there's just for content centers there's party vertical

- [03:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=13502) party vertical and then there's tabs like this so with

- [03:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=13505) and then there's tabs like this so with tabs we just add nav tabs like this

- [03:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=13508) tabs we just add nav tabs like this so they become a tab and it is better

- [03:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=13511) so they become a tab and it is better than

- [03:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=13513) than using the simple case

- [03:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=13516) using the simple case okay like this

- [03:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=13522) and then you can also have no pills like this

- [03:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=13526) you can also have no pills like this you can have fill and justify

- [03:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=13529) you can have fill and justify here

- [03:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=13533) and you can save them item as long as

- [03:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=13535) you can save them item as long as knowledge you can also use now link

- [03:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=13537) knowledge you can also use now link instead of now item here

- [03:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=13541) instead of now item here okay

- [03:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=13542) okay [Music]

- [03:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=13543) [Music] there is flex utilities

- [03:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=13546) there is flex utilities using drop downs here

- [03:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=13548) using drop downs here so here a little better

- [03:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=13550) so here a little better navigation

- [03:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=13552) navigation which has now tabs and a drop down

- [03:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=13555) which has now tabs and a drop down here

- [03:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=13565) okay it is url uh unordered list knocked up

- [03:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=13567) up one one item is now item drop down you

- [03:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=13570) one one item is now item drop down you see it is merging now item and drop down

- [03:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=13583) in here and yeah

- [03:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=13584) yeah okay let's continue

- [03:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=13588) okay let's continue here's the drop downs

- [03:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=13595) okay so to make this um mobile friendly

- [03:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=13597) mobile friendly which was available here as you see

- [03:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=13601) which was available here as you see let's check our now bar

- [03:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=13609) and it uses now

- [03:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=13611) it uses now number expand and be

- [03:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=13618) okay and it has a container fluid i think it is related to container

- [03:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=13620) think it is related to container affiliates

- [03:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=13641) hmm yeah it is not the way we want

- [03:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=13644) yeah it is not the way we want so instead of making this

- [03:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=13663) okay so now what expense may fix our problem

- [03:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=13666) problem no

- [03:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=13673) why did they didn't at example here i don't know

- [03:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=13681) javascript behavior so there is a number with id in my tab

- [03:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=13683) with id in my tab and role presentation

- [03:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=13686) and role presentation [Music]

- [03:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=13688) [Music] so there is

- [03:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=13690) so there is a

- [03:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=13691) a tab content

- [03:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=13710) here okay so there is another example

- [03:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=13712) example using data attributes

- [03:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=13715) using data attributes by the first method constructor

- [03:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=13729) i think they will explain it in inside now but

- [03:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=13731) they will explain it in inside now but instead of nav

- [03:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=13734) instead of nav so now is related to navigation and tabs

- [03:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=13737) so now is related to navigation and tabs you can use it for other proposals as

- [03:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=13739) you can use it for other proposals as well

- [03:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=13743) okay there is now

- [03:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=13748) and another styles

- [03:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=13754) you like to go okay that's not very important tabs

- [03:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=13757) important tabs like here's

- [03:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=13784) so it has id you see

- [03:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=13787) it has id you see it has a home type id profile tab id and

- [03:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=13790) it has a home type id profile tab id and contact tab id

- [03:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=13796) then i think

- [03:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=13798) i think this one requires some javascript

- [03:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=13800) this one requires some javascript because

- [03:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=13801) because i don't see any oh here id home id

- [03:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=13805) i don't see any oh here id home id profile id contact

- [03:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=13818) let's try this if it works or not with our javascript initialization

- [03:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=13830) yeah it is working yeah so we can add some text here

- [03:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=13833) so we can add some text here say

- [03:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=13846) and contact so basically

- [03:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=13850) contact so basically we just type

- [03:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=13851) we just type id as profile and it emits

- [03:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=13855) id as profile and it emits it removes the top here you see there is

- [03:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=13858) it removes the top here you see there is a tab edition

- [03:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=13860) a tab edition and which database toggle top

- [03:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=13864) and which database toggle top and target home

- [03:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=13869) so with tab content here

- [03:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=13872) with tab content here um

- [03:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=13880) okay area neighbors home type i think it is taking this from here

- [03:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=13883) i think it is taking this from here not from these ids

- [03:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=13885) not from these ids so we can basically remove this probably

- [03:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=13889) so we can basically remove this probably remember the id's here

- [03:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=13891) remember the id's here so with area label that's by i think

- [03:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=13895) so with area label that's by i think no i'm not sure let's try that

- [03:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=13898) no i'm not sure let's try that on profile contact it didn't work

- [03:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=13906) so let's try this way okay working so

- [03:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=13909) okay working so it uses the id home and the id here is

- [03:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=13912) it uses the id home and the id here is home tab

- [03:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=13926) there is a idea controls home maybe this is the way it is

- [03:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=13928) is the way it is so when we remove these other controls i

- [03:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=13930) so when we remove these other controls i think it will yeah this is it

- [03:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=13934) think it will yeah this is it let's see what happens

- [03:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=13937) let's see what happens well still working that is not the case

- [03:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=13946) there is target maybe the target is the key

- [03:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=13948) key you see target is id

- [03:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=13954) yeah so target is the key so from these

- [03:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=13956) so target is the key so from these targets

- [03:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=13958) targets uh database target

- [03:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=13961) uh database target it is taking

- [03:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=13963) it is taking which

- [03:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=13964) which tab will be activated

- [03:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=13966) tab will be activated so these are top panes fade show active

- [03:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=13969) so these are top panes fade show active and others are the default when you

- [03:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=13972) and others are the default when you click this button

- [03:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=13973) click this button you see it has data ps toggle top and

- [03:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=13976) you see it has data ps toggle top and database target

- [03:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=13978) database target home

- [03:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=13979) home so from that it is just

- [03:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=13982) so from that it is just having a

- [03:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=13983) having a knob

- [03:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=13986) knob tagging so when i refresh it will start

- [03:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=13988) tagging so when i refresh it will start working again you see

- [03:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=13995) yeah tab associated content it is associated with a database target here

- [03:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14000) associated with a database target here and it works with pills as well

- [03:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14005) and it works with pills as well okay

- [03:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14007) okay what prepares

- [03:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14009) what prepares using data attributes

- [03:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14012) using data attributes are there anything special here

- [03:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14015) are there anything special here let's test this

- [03:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14018) let's test this probably no

- [03:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14028) okay and fade effect

- [03:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14035) okay so you see there is fate

- [03:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14038) so you see there is fate that is how it gets its effect we

- [03:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14041) that is how it gets its effect we [Music]

- [03:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14042) [Music] do we have that snow item where do we

- [03:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14045) do we have that snow item where do we edit

- [03:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14046) edit we add it to the top content

- [03:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14069) okay so then fade oh i don't see any difference here

- [03:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14071) difference here looks same

- [03:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14073) looks same you see selected element has a rather

- [03:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14075) you see selected element has a rather different coloring as well

- [03:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14079) different coloring as well and

- [03:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14090) okay i think it's not very important let's move to the now bar

- [03:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14098) navbar documentation and examples for

- [03:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14100) documentation and examples for bootstrap's powerful responsive

- [03:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14102) bootstrap's powerful responsive navigation header the navbar

- [03:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14105) navigation header the navbar includes support for branding navigation

- [03:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14107) includes support for branding navigation and more including support for our

- [03:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14109) and more including support for our collapse plugin so now bar is the one

- [03:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14111) collapse plugin so now bar is the one that we are looking for

- [03:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14113) that we are looking for which will

- [03:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14115) which will change bar to be

- [03:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14117) change bar to be um

- [03:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14119) um menu like this you see it is like this

- [03:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14122) menu like this you see it is like this when you are when you are in mobile

- [03:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14124) when you are when you are in mobile and dimension resolution and it becomes

- [03:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14127) and dimension resolution and it becomes full bar

- [03:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14129) full bar so how it works

- [03:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14131) so how it works how it works

- [03:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14133) how it works here's what you need to know before

- [03:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14135) here's what you need to know before getting started with the nav bar

- [03:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14137) getting started with the nav bar nav bars require a wrapping dot nav bar

- [03:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14140) nav bars require a wrapping dot nav bar with dot nav bar expand sm nd lg excel

- [03:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14145) with dot nav bar expand sm nd lg excel xxl for responsive collapsing and color

- [03:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14147) xxl for responsive collapsing and color scheme classes

- [03:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14149) scheme classes nav bars and their contents are fluid by

- [03:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14151) nav bars and their contents are fluid by default

- [03:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14153) default change the container to limit their

- [03:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14155) change the container to limit their horizontal width in different ways

- [03:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14158) horizontal width in different ways use our spacing and flex utility classes

- [03:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14160) use our spacing and flex utility classes for controlling spacing and alignment

- [03:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14162) for controlling spacing and alignment within nav bars

- [03:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14164) within nav bars nav bars are responsive by default but

- [03:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14166) nav bars are responsive by default but you can easily modify them to change

- [03:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14168) you can easily modify them to change that responsive behavior depends on our

- [03:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14171) that responsive behavior depends on our collapse javascript plug-in

- [03:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14175) collapse javascript plug-in ensure accessibility by using anav

- [03:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14177) ensure accessibility by using anav element or if using a more generic

- [03:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14179) element or if using a more generic element such as adiv add a role equals

- [03:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14182) element such as adiv add a role equals navigation to every navbar to explicitly

- [03:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14185) navigation to every navbar to explicitly identify it as a landmark region for

- [03:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14187) identify it as a landmark region for users of assistive technologies

- [03:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14190) users of assistive technologies okay

- [03:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14191) okay and support content number brand for

- [03:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14194) and support content number brand for your company product or project name

- [03:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14197) your company product or project name now but now for full hit and lightweight

- [03:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14199) now but now for full hit and lightweight navigation

- [03:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14201) navigation logger now now particular for use with

- [03:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14203) logger now now particular for use with our close plugin

- [03:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14205) our close plugin now our text

- [03:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14208) now our text okay let's start with examples so

- [03:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14218) okay here it starts then now and close now

- [03:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14220) here it starts then now and close now and number expand lg so it will be

- [03:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14223) and number expand lg so it will be expanded when our screen is large it

- [03:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14226) expanded when our screen is large it will have a light bar styling and

- [03:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14229) will have a light bar styling and background will be light

- [03:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14231) background will be light so when i replace i will see all of this

- [03:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14234) so when i replace i will see all of this yeah you see

- [03:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14235) yeah you see it is light

- [03:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14237) it is light uh it is taking full space right now if

- [03:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14239) uh it is taking full space right now if i wanted to take a rather

- [03:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14246) uh if i wanted to have some paddings

- [03:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14250) if i wanted to have some paddings yeah when i make it container it will be

- [03:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14253) yeah when i make it container it will be like this

- [03:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14254) like this i could also achieve this with

- [03:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14257) i could also achieve this with margin

- [03:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14263) okay margin which

- [03:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14265) margin which which

- [03:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14266) which resolution and b5 perhaps

- [03:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14276) okay margin bottom so this is not mx5

- [03:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14283) yeah a mix is making margin bit like this so if i remove x it will be full

- [03:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14285) this so if i remove x it will be full margin

- [03:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14292) yeah and

- [03:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14294) and i could also add margin top probably

- [03:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14297) i could also add margin top probably but there is no element in the top so

- [03:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14299) but there is no element in the top so maybe that is why it's not

- [03:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14301) maybe that is why it's not getting margin from the top of the page

- [03:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14304) getting margin from the top of the page yeah

- [03:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14306) yeah okay

- [03:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14308) okay so

- [03:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14309) so you see it has a container fluid

- [03:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14312) you see it has a container fluid uh

- [03:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14313) uh so with container videos it is able to

- [03:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14316) so with container videos it is able to change its behavior

- [03:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14319) change its behavior um

- [03:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14321) um then it starts with a class number brand

- [03:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14324) then it starts with a class number brand and it is number so this is the brand

- [03:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14328) and it is number so this is the brand oh oh i see it is our margin type is

- [03:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14331) oh oh i see it is our margin type is also working

- [03:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14332) also working so let's change our brand to turtle's

- [03:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14337) so let's change our brand to turtle's lecture for example

- [03:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14342) like this so you can also put an image here

- [03:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14346) so you can also put an image here let's put an image from my website for

- [03:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14348) let's put an image from my website for example

- [03:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14353) okay um from media

- [03:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14355) from media let me turn this into

- [03:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14358) let me turn this into english okay

- [03:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14360) english okay uh from media here let's see some game

- [03:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14364) uh from media here let's see some game banners

- [03:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14366) banners and

- [03:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14369) and for example let's add this as a brand

- [03:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14373) for example let's add this as a brand so instead of our a class brands it is

- [03:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14378) so instead of our a class brands it is like this

- [03:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14380) like this i think we can have an image as a brand

- [03:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14384) i think we can have an image as a brand no i'm not sure

- [03:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14390) class equal to brand

- [03:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14392) brand okay src equal to this

- [03:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14396) okay src equal to this and let's remove this let's see if it

- [03:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14399) and let's remove this let's see if it will work or not

- [04:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14401) will work or not it won't be clickable but

- [04:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14404) it won't be clickable but yeah oh it's working so you see this now

- [04:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14407) yeah oh it's working so you see this now brand class is handling everything for

- [04:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14409) brand class is handling everything for us

- [04:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14410) us it is not clickable i could make it

- [04:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14412) it is not clickable i could make it clickable

- [04:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14414) clickable uh with

- [04:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14415) uh with for example

- [04:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14416) for example [Music]

- [04:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14419) [Music] instead of this i can add

- [04:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14422) instead of this i can add it's like this and let's see how it

- [04:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14424) it's like this and let's see how it looks

- [04:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14429) yeah now i can click it if i remove the now class here what

- [04:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14432) if i remove the now class here what happens

- [04:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14438) working nice uh so a brand image with a

- [04:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14442) uh so a brand image with a clickable link you can make the link

- [04:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14444) clickable link you can make the link every anything you want instead of this

- [04:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14446) every anything you want instead of this i can

- [04:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14448) i can make it to

- [04:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14450) make it to surf

- [04:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14451) surf url yeah like this you see now it's

- [04:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14454) url yeah like this you see now it's using your full page

- [04:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14456) using your full page refresh

- [04:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14457) refresh and there is home link drop down let's

- [04:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14460) and there is home link drop down let's continue to analyze the code

- [04:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14464) continue to analyze the code so there is button class now bar toggle

- [04:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14467) so there is button class now bar toggle type button database toggle collapse

- [04:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14470) type button database toggle collapse database target number supported content

- [04:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14474) database target number supported content area controls numbers for your content

- [04:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14476) area controls numbers for your content false label token navigation and there

- [04:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14479) false label token navigation and there is a spawn number together item

- [04:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14481) is a spawn number together item so why do we need this

- [04:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14487) um i think this will be used

- [04:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14490) i think this will be used for this menu let's check it out

- [04:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14499) yeah so now particular is the thing that is becoming visible when

- [04:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14502) is becoming visible when our screen size is lower than large here

- [04:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14507) our screen size is lower than large here and that is it so this is used for

- [04:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14511) and that is it so this is used for this button is used for

- [04:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14518) it is i think called as hamburger menu so this is used for mobile uh

- [04:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14521) so this is used for mobile uh friendliness

- [04:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14523) friendliness then there is we have collapse number

- [04:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14525) then there is we have collapse number collapse id number supported content

- [04:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14528) collapse id number supported content it is the rest of the

- [04:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14530) it is the rest of the uh navar so this is the thing that is

- [04:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14532) uh navar so this is the thing that is collapsible

- [04:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14534) collapsible then

- [04:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14536) then screen resolution gets

- [04:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14538) screen resolution gets smaller like this

- [04:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14544) okay and then there is an ordered list inside it

- [04:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14547) an ordered list inside it then there is a form

- [04:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14549) then there is a form so form is this search box and unordered

- [04:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14553) so form is this search box and unordered list is here

- [04:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14555) list is here so inside unordered list we have

- [04:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14558) so inside unordered list we have navar navigation

- [04:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14565) it has auto margin and break two and break large zero

- [04:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14569) and break two and break large zero i think uh this is merging break two

- [04:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14581) okay you can look for what they mean this is perhaps right and left i'm not

- [04:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14583) this is perhaps right and left i'm not sure

- [04:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14585) sure and there is navigation items and there

- [04:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14589) and there is navigation items and there is a navigation

- [04:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14590) is a navigation item but it is a drop down like this

- [04:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14593) item but it is a drop down like this so just for just by looking these

- [04:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14596) so just for just by looking these examples you can

- [04:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14598) examples you can make your

- [04:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14600) make your navigation as you want

- [04:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14607) okay and then there is d flex uh so this form is uh

- [04:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14610) there is d flex uh so this form is uh set as b flex display flex

- [04:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14614) set as b flex display flex and it has a form control input

- [04:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14618) and it has a form control input here

- [04:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14620) here with margin two

- [04:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14622) with margin two when i increase this margin five let's

- [04:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14625) when i increase this margin five let's see how it changed

- [04:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14633) you see now it is five margin it to the uh search button

- [04:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14636) uh search button uh the place all the research area name

- [04:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14639) uh the place all the research area name so area label is used for

- [04:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14645) assistive technologies like screen readers and then there is a button

- [04:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14648) readers and then there is a button okay so of course you need to

- [04:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14651) okay so of course you need to set for postfake currently it will

- [04:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14653) set for postfake currently it will prospect to the

- [04:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14656) prospect to the okay this page

- [04:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14659) okay this page uh with just this and this input doesn't

- [04:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14663) uh with just this and this input doesn't have any name or id so you can't even

- [04:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14665) have any name or id so you can't even read it at the code behind

- [04:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14668) read it at the code behind anyway that is not the topic right now

- [04:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14670) anyway that is not the topic right now so this is a

- [04:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14671) so this is a now verb fully responsive and fully

- [04:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14674) now verb fully responsive and fully customizable

- [04:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14676) customizable i can even make this now a bar as a dark

- [04:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14680) i can even make this now a bar as a dark so instead of light i will make it dark

- [04:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14683) so instead of light i will make it dark and bg will be dark as well

- [04:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14685) and bg will be dark as well so when i refresh

- [04:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14688) so when i refresh you see now the color coloring changes

- [04:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14691) you see now the color coloring changes and background changes

- [04:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14694) and background changes button change it as well

- [04:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14697) button change it as well actually the button is same but it is

- [04:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14698) actually the button is same but it is looking different to

- [04:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14700) looking different to background color change there is a

- [04:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14702) background color change there is a bronze round is working

- [04:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14704) bronze round is working you can even change now brands with a

- [04:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14708) you can even change now brands with a image which we already did that

- [04:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14711) image which we already did that you can even put a

- [04:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14713) you can even put a svg

- [04:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14715) svg okay so

- [04:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14716) okay so this is what we did exactly actually

- [04:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14719) this is what we did exactly actually and

- [04:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14721) and image and text is also supported wow

- [04:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14724) image and text is also supported wow cool

- [04:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14726) cool like this

- [04:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14727) like this so let's add

- [04:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14729) so let's add [Music]

- [04:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14731) [Music] text as well to our brand

- [04:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14737) such as i think where do we put it

- [04:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14739) i think where do we put it and we put it inside

- [04:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14741) and we put it inside attack like

- [04:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14745) attack like this

- [04:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14746) this this is the game that i developed

- [04:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14753) yeah not working and

- [04:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14756) and we have seen nav there is nothing

- [04:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14758) we have seen nav there is nothing special here

- [04:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14764) okay i don't see anything different forms

- [04:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14766) forms now our inside number you can put

- [04:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14768) now our inside number you can put anything you want

- [04:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14770) anything you want input group such as this

- [04:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14772) input group such as this we have seen that

- [04:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14774) we have seen that uh text number text

- [04:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14778) uh text number text color schemes there is color schemes

- [04:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14780) color schemes there is color schemes dark primary and light there are three

- [04:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14783) dark primary and light there are three main color schemes

- [04:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14786) main color schemes i don't know if there is another

- [04:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14787) i don't know if there is another as well let's check it out

- [04:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14789) as well let's check it out so it should automatically show me

- [04:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14797) there is now bar dark light

- [04:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14798) light text

- [04:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14800) text brand

- [04:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14801) brand [Music]

- [04:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14810) so i think it is dark

- [04:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14811) dark light and

- [04:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14820) i see so this is still dark but with primary background

- [04:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14823) primary background so what does dark or light makes it it

- [04:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14825) so what does dark or light makes it it changes the color of the

- [04:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14829) changes the color of the text i think

- [04:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14831) text i think yeah

- [04:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14833) yeah okay and

- [04:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14839) then you use containers although it is not required you can wrap number inside

- [04:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14841) not required you can wrap number inside the container to center it on a page

- [04:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14843) the container to center it on a page though dotnet internet content is still

- [04:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14845) though dotnet internet content is still required so inner container is always

- [04:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14847) required so inner container is always required this one and you can also

- [04:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14852) required this one and you can also wrap it with a container

- [04:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14855) wrap it with a container instead of wrapping with a container we

- [04:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14857) instead of wrapping with a container we just added a

- [04:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14858) just added a margin

- [04:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14860) margin but we can do that as well

- [04:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14863) but we can do that as well so there's placements

- [04:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14871) okay fix it top oh i see you can also fix it tough so

- [04:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14874) oh i see you can also fix it tough so this is an important thing let me show

- [04:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14876) this is an important thing let me show you what does this do

- [04:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14877) you what does this do currently when i navigate to the

- [04:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14880) currently when i navigate to the you see when i scroll down the bar is

- [04:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14883) you see when i scroll down the bar is not visible

- [04:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14884) not visible but if i add a fixed top

- [04:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14887) but if i add a fixed top close to the bar let's see what happens

- [04:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14890) close to the bar let's see what happens and now it is always visible like this

- [04:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14893) and now it is always visible like this you see

- [04:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14899) and fix it bottom stick it up let's see what i'll stick it up to

- [04:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14901) what i'll stick it up to do

- [04:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14909) okay so it is oh nice city top is better so when

- [04:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14911) oh nice city top is better so when you're at the top it is like this and as

- [04:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14913) you're at the top it is like this and as you go down it is like this yeah

- [04:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14916) you go down it is like this yeah i i would prefer stick it up

- [04:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14919) i i would prefer stick it up and scrolling so what is this scrolling

- [04:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14928) so scrolling does what i don't see anything relates to

- [04:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14930) what i don't see anything relates to scrolling

- [04:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14943) so let's try scrolling where is the scroll

- [04:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14946) scroll we say that i was scrolled but i don't

- [04:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14948) we say that i was scrolled but i don't see

- [04:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14960) okay so let's expand this drop down

- [04:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14968) okay refresh

- [04:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14976) and it is taking entire uh

- [04:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14977) uh screen size and when i refresh

- [04:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14981) screen size and when i refresh yeah there is no secret so i can't even

- [04:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14983) yeah there is no secret so i can't even see the bottom of the

- [04:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14985) see the bottom of the drop down right now so when i add now

- [04:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14987) drop down right now so when i add now we're screwing let's see what happens

- [04:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14994) okay now uh

- [04:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=14996) uh now wash

- [04:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=15006) is this the correct plus yeah and let's see if it changes behaviors

- [04:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=15013) oh yeah yeah so you see now the number is scrollable

- [04:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=15016) so you see now the number is scrollable um

- [04:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=15017) um however i need to also set some

- [04:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=15020) however i need to also set some size

- [04:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=15022) size so

- [04:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=15024) so the style is like this yeah i need to

- [04:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=15026) the style is like this yeah i need to add this

- [04:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=15027) add this style override

- [04:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=15029) style override here

- [04:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=15031) here yeah

- [04:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=15032) yeah so when i make it

- [04:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=15034) so when i make it like this

- [04:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=15036) like this okay not 100 like let's make it 200

- [04:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=15039) okay not 100 like let's make it 200 pixel

- [04:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=15054) um this is not the thing that we need

- [04:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=15065) now bar head i think i need to change this

- [04:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=15086) you see these numbers scroll maybe i need to add it to the

- [04:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=15089) need to add it to the this drop down

- [04:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=15091) this drop down so now item though

- [04:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=15097) so probably i need to make this scrollable

- [04:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=15100) scrollable let's see drop down

- [04:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=15101) let's see drop down [Music]

- [04:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=15103) [Music] scroll now

- [04:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=15140) okay there is already a question related to this

- [04:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=15141) to this well when we open it

- [04:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=15159) so there is not a regular class we just need to

- [04:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=15161) regular class we just need to make our own class

- [04:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=15164) make our own class that we're in the

- [04:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=15169) building class so i'm making it like this 300 pixel

- [04:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=15173) this 300 pixel and here we are adding our custom

- [04:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=15176) and here we are adding our custom class and when we refresh

- [04:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=15183) now it is scrollable here i would expect to have a building class

- [04:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=15185) i would expect to have a building class but i don't see it

- [04:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=15192) and when we make it like this what happens

- [04:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=15193) happens so oh nice it is still scrollable nice

- [04:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=15196) so oh nice it is still scrollable nice very good

- [04:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=15201) all right so what else there is responsive behaviors now particular

- [04:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=15202) responsive behaviors now particular collapse number expands together here we

- [04:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=15205) collapse number expands together here we already tested that

- [04:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=15208) already tested that external content

- [04:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=15230) so this is a d class collapsible by default it is being collapsed

- [04:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=15232) default it is being collapsed and uh database toggle so we add a

- [04:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=15235) and uh database toggle so we add a button

- [04:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=15237) button which targets this

- [04:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=15240) which targets this and the target is the external content

- [04:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=15242) and the target is the external content here

- [04:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=15248) database target database toggle and it was ic

- [04:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=15253) so you can also use something like this if you ever needed to

- [04:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=15256) if you ever needed to um

- [04:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=15258) um yes

- [04:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=15260) yes and we refresh

- [04:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=15262) and we refresh you see it will just open it so let's

- [04:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=15265) you see it will just open it so let's assume that this is your menu and when

- [04:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=15267) assume that this is your menu and when people click it they will see this

- [04:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=15270) people click it they will see this okay

- [04:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=15272) okay and

- [04:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=15273) and yeah that's it

- [04:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=15281) all right so there are still so many things

- [04:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=15297) actually looks like we may need to have lectures

- [04:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=15298) lectures 17 as well because it is over four hours

- [04:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=15302) 17 as well because it is over four hours already so we have finished it now brush

- [04:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=15306) already so we have finished it now brush i think i will

- [04:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=15308) i think i will and the lecture here

- [04:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=15315) yeah bullstrap is taking too much time because it is huge

- [04:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=15317) because it is huge actually these lectures should be

- [04:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=15319) actually these lectures should be separated into two

- [04:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=15328) semesters not a single semester no but you get the idea you already have

- [04:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=15330) but you get the idea you already have the idea of how to use a bootstrap how

- [04:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=15334) the idea of how to use a bootstrap how it's what is its logic

- [04:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=15341) so you can also look and find what you need for

- [04:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=15343) and find what you need for and you can fix your problems and

- [04:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=15347) and you can fix your problems and you can solve your

- [04:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=15349) you can solve your uh

- [04:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=15350) uh problems as well

- [04:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=15353) problems as well so this is we already

- [04:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=15355) so this is we already we have already covered the

- [04:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=15357) we have already covered the uh

- [04:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=15358) uh most of the

- [04:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=15360) most of the bootstrap already

- [04:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=15365) now there's color schemes i think i will still continue this

- [04:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=15381) okay stick it up stick it up is really important let's

- [04:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=15383) important let's type it as well do you know why i type

- [04:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=15385) type it as well do you know why i type this content because it may help

- [04:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=15397) search or google search and it also gives an idea of what is

- [04:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=15400) what's worth what is inside the video

- [04:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=15406) um scroll

- [04:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=15407) scroll [Music]

- [04:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=15409) [Music] okay drop down menu

- [04:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=15416) okay togglers are really important part of bootstrap

- [04:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=15420) are really important part of bootstrap okay external content here

- [04:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=15423) okay external content here all rights then there is of canvas

- [04:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=15432) off canvas build hidden sidebars into your project

- [04:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=15434) build hidden sidebars into your project for navigation shopping carts and more

- [04:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=15436) for navigation shopping carts and more with a few classes and our javascript

- [04:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=15438) with a few classes and our javascript plugin

- [04:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=15439) plugin okay so what is this

- [04:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=15442) okay so what is this how it works

- [04:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=15444) how it works off canvas is a sidebar component that

- [04:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=15446) off canvas is a sidebar component that can be toggled via javascript to appear

- [04:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=15448) can be toggled via javascript to appear from the left right or bottom edge of

- [04:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=15450) from the left right or bottom edge of the viewport

- [04:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=15452) the viewport buttons or anchors are used as triggers

- [04:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=15454) buttons or anchors are used as triggers that are attached to specific elements

- [04:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=15455) that are attached to specific elements you toggle and data attributes are used

- [04:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=15458) you toggle and data attributes are used to invoke our javascript

- [04:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=15460) to invoke our javascript so data is used for invoking

- [04:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=15463) so data is used for invoking and

- [04:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=15464) and there is

- [04:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=15466) there is attaching

- [04:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=15470) off canvas shares some of the same javascript code as modals

- [04:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=15472) javascript code as modals conceptually they are quite similar but

- [04:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=15474) conceptually they are quite similar but they are separate plugins

- [04:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=15477) they are separate plugins similarly some source says variables for

- [04:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=15479) similarly some source says variables for of canvas's styles and dimensions are

- [04:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=15481) of canvas's styles and dimensions are inherited from the modals variables

- [04:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=15485) inherited from the modals variables when shown off canvas includes a default

- [04:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=15487) when shown off canvas includes a default backdrop that can be clicked to hide the

- [04:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=15489) backdrop that can be clicked to hide the off canvas

- [04:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=15491) off canvas similar to modals only one off canvas

- [04:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=15493) similar to modals only one off canvas can be shown at a time

- [04:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=15495) can be shown at a time so it supports only one of of canvas

- [04:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=15500) so it supports only one of of canvas okay there are some examples so let's

- [04:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=15502) okay there are some examples so let's start with an example

- [04:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=15511) okay so it has it is a div with class of canvas and offline must start

- [04:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=15514) canvas and offline must start its top index is minus one

- [04:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=15517) its top index is minus one top index minus one i think it it makes

- [04:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=15520) top index minus one i think it it makes it uh invisible

- [04:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=15540) um okay someone already asked that in stack overflow

- [04:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=15542) stack overflow okay what is the top index attribute in

- [04:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=15544) okay what is the top index attribute in bootstrap tree for its documentation

- [04:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=15545) bootstrap tree for its documentation don't say anything for and as such

- [04:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=15563) okay tab index minus one value removes the element from default navigation flow

- [04:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=15566) the element from default navigation flow yeah user cannot type to it but it

- [04:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=15568) yeah user cannot type to it but it allows it to receive programmatic focus

- [04:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=15570) allows it to receive programmatic focus meaning focus can be set it from a link

- [04:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=15572) meaning focus can be set it from a link or scripting

- [04:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=15582) so it removes it from the default navigation flow basically it is becoming

- [04:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=15585) navigation flow basically it is becoming invisible

- [04:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=15587) invisible when we refresh i think it won't be here

- [04:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=15590) when we refresh i think it won't be here yeah you see i cannot see it anywhere it

- [04:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=15593) yeah you see i cannot see it anywhere it is not

- [04:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=15594) is not available in the flow of the html

- [04:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=15598) available in the flow of the html you see it is here

- [04:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=15607) but its computed position is where it is

- [04:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=15631) when i click focus i can't even see it when i focus

- [04:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=15650) okay scroll into view means it is going there

- [04:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=15653) there when i click and scroll into weave it is

- [04:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=15655) when i click and scroll into weave it is not available so top index minus it

- [04:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=15657) not available so top index minus it removes it from the

- [04:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=15660) removes it from the dom

- [04:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=15661) dom so i need a trigger

- [04:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=15663) so i need a trigger to make it visible

- [04:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=15665) to make it visible so

- [04:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=15666) so here a full example

- [04:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=15672) okay so let's remove this

- [04:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=15674) so let's remove this okay let's analyze it so we have two

- [04:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=15676) okay let's analyze it so we have two buttons

- [04:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=15677) buttons you see database toggle is off canvas

- [04:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=15680) you see database toggle is off canvas ref is target by the way you can i think

- [04:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=15683) ref is target by the way you can i think we can even use

- [04:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=15685) we can even use targets

- [04:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=15686) targets yeah target is used for button and graph

- [04:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=15689) yeah target is used for button and graph is used for

- [04:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=15690) is used for uh attack

- [04:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=15693) uh attack road is burden earlier control of

- [04:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=15695) road is burden earlier control of converse link with the ref and bottom

- [04:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=15697) converse link with the ref and bottom with a date abs target

- [04:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=15700) with a date abs target they both have

- [04:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=15702) they both have database toggle

- [04:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=15703) database toggle and aws target

- [04:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=15707) and aws target so here are of canvas and id is of

- [04:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=15710) so here are of canvas and id is of course example you see target is of

- [04:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=15712) course example you see target is of course example

- [04:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=15714) course example when you use

- [04:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=15716) when you use a target or hiref you need to add it's

- [04:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=15719) a target or hiref you need to add it's it's its id you can also target multiple

- [04:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=15722) it's its id you can also target multiple uh

- [04:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=15724) uh elements with a class selector but

- [04:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=15727) elements with a class selector but of commas can we only have one at a time

- [04:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=15730) of commas can we only have one at a time active

- [04:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=15731) active okay so

- [04:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=15733) okay so let's save and refresh to test

- [04:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=15742) okay now it's opening from the left

- [04:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=15744) left and when we click somewhere else it is

- [04:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=15746) and when we click somewhere else it is getting auto closed

- [04:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=15747) getting auto closed so we can also i think change auto close

- [04:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=15750) so we can also i think change auto close behavior as well

- [04:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=15765) i wonder if this will work for off cameras

- [04:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=15771) no didn't work

- [04:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=15803) okay it is working when we remove um database toggle i wonder if it will work

- [04:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=15805) database toggle i wonder if it will work probably not

- [04:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=15808) probably not so it won't

- [04:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=15810) so it won't trigger the

- [04:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=15813) trigger the okay yeah it's not working

- [04:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=15815) okay yeah it's not working okay let's continue to example placement

- [04:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=15819) okay let's continue to example placement so start place of converse on the left

- [04:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=15821) so start place of converse on the left and right top top

- [04:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=15825) and right top top okay let's try with

- [04:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=15828) okay let's try with top

- [04:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=15830) top which is here not a start or top

- [04:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=15841) and what else that is

- [04:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=15843) what else that is backdrop

- [04:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=15853) so chronic body element is disabled from our spectrum are visible

- [04:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=15859) back robot is flowing okay

- [04:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=15864) i see so you see um

- [04:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=15866) um when we enable backdrop

- [04:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=15877) of course with petrol i cannot scroll the page you see there is no scrolling

- [04:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=15880) the page you see there is no scrolling and when we enable both scrolling and

- [04:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=15883) and when we enable both scrolling and backdrop i can

- [04:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=15886) backdrop i can scroll

- [04:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=15887) scroll and when i enable both scrolling i can

- [04:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=15889) and when i enable both scrolling i can scroll

- [04:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=15894) so let's see the difference this is of converse start of commerce

- [04:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=15897) this is of converse start of commerce start start

- [04:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=15899) start start and where the behavior is added

- [04:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=15911) um off scrolling label converse title

- [04:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=15914) off scrolling label converse title you see here database backdrop so this

- [04:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=15917) you see here database backdrop so this is

- [04:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=15918) is what changes the behavior

- [04:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=15925) there is also let's see

- [04:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=15941) okay when we don't add anything as database backdrop it is by default true

- [04:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=15944) database backdrop it is by default true probably

- [04:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=15950) and in this case database dismiss of commas

- [04:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=15951) commas i see so i if i change this

- [04:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=15956) i see so i if i change this uh where is it

- [04:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=15957) uh where is it it is added to the

- [04:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=15967) yes this means equal to

- [04:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=15971) this means equal to of course

- [04:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=16000) um [Music]

- [04:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=16003) [Music] bootstrap of

- [04:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=16005) bootstrap of canvas dismiss

- [04:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=16010) i will explain you what i am looking for in a

- [04:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=16013) explain you what i am looking for in a minute

- [04:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=16015) minute so i want that it won't disappear

- [04:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=16018) so i want that it won't disappear when click it somewhere else

- [04:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=16062) this means we already had example for that

- [04:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=16063) that model i guess

- [04:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=16065) model i guess database dismiss this external internal

- [04:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=16069) database dismiss this external internal backdrop

- [04:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=16107) yeah it was probably this database backdrop

- [04:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=16109) backdrop so let's add it to our of canvas

- [04:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=16113) so let's add it to our of canvas and see if it is working

- [04:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=16158) okay off canvas back

- [04:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=16160) off canvas back row

- [04:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=16176) okay so there's backdrop blogging ah i see so this is

- [04:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=16178) see so this is also true not static

- [04:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=16181) also true not static so when i set it false

- [04:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=16184) so when i set it false let's refresh

- [04:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=16187) let's refresh and when i click somewhere else you see

- [04:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=16189) and when i click somewhere else you see it is not getting closer i need to click

- [04:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=16191) it is not getting closer i need to click this close button

- [04:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=16193) this close button okay uh yeah we have

- [04:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=16196) okay uh yeah we have uh did everything we did

- [04:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=16206) off cameras and how it works

- [04:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=16211) examples okay

- [04:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=16213) okay of course components

- [04:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=16225) placement right left

- [04:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=16227) right left bottom

- [04:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=16229) bottom um

- [04:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=16230) um spectrum

- [04:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=16244) and database spectrum yeah

- [04:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=16262) okay and yeah so then

- [04:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=16264) so then there is pagination

- [04:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=16280) pagination documentation and examples for showing

- [04:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=16282) documentation and examples for showing pagination to indicate a series of

- [04:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=16284) pagination to indicate a series of related content exists across multiple

- [04:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=16286) related content exists across multiple pages

- [04:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=16291) this is just a [Music]

- [04:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=16292) [Music] regular overview

- [04:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=16295) regular overview we use a large block of connected links

- [04:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=16297) we use a large block of connected links for our pagination making links hard to

- [04:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=16299) for our pagination making links hard to miss and easily scalable all while

- [04:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=16302) miss and easily scalable all while providing large hit areas

- [04:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=16304) providing large hit areas pagination is built with list html

- [04:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=16307) pagination is built with list html elements so screen readers can announce

- [04:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=16309) elements so screen readers can announce the number of available

- [04:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=16311) the number of available a wrapping nav element to identify it as

- [04:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=16314) a wrapping nav element to identify it as a navigation section to screen readers

- [04:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=16316) a navigation section to screen readers and other assistive technologies

- [04:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=16319) and other assistive technologies in addition as pages likely have more

- [04:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=16321) in addition as pages likely have more than one such navigation section it's

- [04:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=16323) than one such navigation section it's advisable to provide a descriptive aria

- [04:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=16325) advisable to provide a descriptive aria label for the nav to reflect its purpose

- [04:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=16329) label for the nav to reflect its purpose for example if the pagination component

- [04:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=16331) for example if the pagination component is used to navigate between a set of

- [04:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=16333) is used to navigate between a set of search results an appropriate label

- [04:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=16335) search results an appropriate label could be aria label equal search results

- [04:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=16338) could be aria label equal search results pages

- [04:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=16339) pages yeah like this

- [04:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=16345) so these are regular links uh so it is up to you how to

- [04:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=16348) so it is up to you how to uh done your pagination

- [04:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=16351) uh done your pagination it will of course um

- [04:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=16355) it will of course um sends database to server and receive

- [04:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=16357) sends database to server and receive data

- [04:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=16358) data i think it should also have some active

- [04:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=16360) i think it should also have some active class or something

- [04:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=16362) class or something yeah

- [04:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=16363) yeah let's test it out

- [04:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=16371) yeah active is showing which page is now active

- [04:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=16377) uh working with icons you can also add icons so

- [04:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=16379) icons so for icons

- [04:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=16390) this this html icon

- [04:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=16400) image as well as feature or something disabled active state

- [04:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=16408) okay sizing alignment

- [04:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=16416) okay what about uh too many pages for pagination

- [04:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=16417) pagination then we would need to have i think a

- [04:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=16421) then we would need to have i think a drop down

- [04:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=16422) drop down menu inside pagination

- [04:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=16430) so how can we have that i think we can copy and paste this drop-down

- [04:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=16433) we can copy and paste this drop-down menu here

- [04:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=16435) menu here and instead of three

- [04:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=16439) and instead of three let's test it out how it looks

- [04:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=16441) let's test it out how it looks um

- [04:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=16442) um we can add one two three

- [04:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=16445) we can add one two three actually since it is page three so let's

- [04:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=16448) actually since it is page three so let's add

- [04:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=16449) add three

- [04:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=16450) three or

- [04:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=16452) or five

- [04:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=16459) and let's refresh okay

- [04:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=16460) okay so bootstrap uh pagination drop down

- [04:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=16464) so bootstrap uh pagination drop down pages yeah

- [04:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=16469) okay [Music]

- [04:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=16471) [Music] how do we make it

- [04:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=16484) so there's pagination yeah and no

- [04:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=16494) okay so there is a jump page oh it's not working

- [04:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=16501) okay so what we need is a jump page how do we have it

- [04:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=16510) pulse drop jump page

- [04:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=16548) okay you'll see there is something oh it is getting loaded

- [04:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=16553) and here so how do we select

- [04:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=16556) so how do we select it is still not like

- [04:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=16561) yeah this is still not like what we want

- [04:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=16565) like what we want we can also see the source code here

- [04:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=16568) we can also see the source code here you see

- [04:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=16577) so there is a data url here uh data pagination true data search true

- [04:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=16580) uh data pagination true data search true data jumps through

- [04:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=16588) and it initializes it with the bootstrap table

- [04:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=16590) table this is an extension of page jump to

- [04:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=16592) this is an extension of page jump to bootstrap table

- [04:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=16605) but actually i'm looking for a drop down jumping

- [04:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=16610) not this one [Music]

- [04:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=16628) let's try this source code inside our application

- [04:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=16630) application okay

- [04:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=16638) okay it should work because we are adding our scripts

- [04:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=16646) it is loaded and here i'm going to change

- [04:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=16652) data show jump to search pagination there was

- [04:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=16653) there was an example somewhere else

- [04:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=16675) maybe this one data

- [04:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=16677) data show

- [04:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=16682) jump through

- [04:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=16683) through my pages

- [04:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=16686) my pages am i typing correct

- [04:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=16698) equals true let's see

- [04:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=16710) so if you wonder what is this data let's look for it

- [04:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=16720) data you see it shows the number of items not filtered

- [04:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=16722) items not filtered and rose id name price

- [04:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=16725) and rose id name price yeah

- [04:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=16726) yeah so this plugin is using

- [04:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=16729) so this plugin is using json data

- [04:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=16739) but what i'm looking for is pagination with the dropdown

- [04:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=16750) we'll stop landing paste things okay this is not what we're looking for

- [04:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=16766) oh i see so it has it uses a select option

- [04:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=16783) that's actually what we use what we added and an order of this drop down

- [04:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=16785) added and an order of this drop down menu

- [04:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=16792) maybe i also need to add a page item to this

- [04:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=16793) this oh shift

- [04:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=16832) okay don't be searched like this let's see what happens

- [04:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=16878) let's look to demo this is what we are looking for

- [04:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=16904) i would ask these on stack overflow if anybody

- [04:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=16906) stack overflow if anybody know it or not but

- [04:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=16910) know it or not but currently we are at the video so i can't

- [04:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=16913) currently we are at the video so i can't do it

- [04:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=16922) so inside page item our drop down menu is not visible

- [04:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=16924) is not visible what about if i make this page item as a

- [04:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=16927) what about if i make this page item as a drop down menu

- [04:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=16929) drop down menu and add more

- [04:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=16931) and add more list item inside it

- [04:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=16947) maybe instead of this let's make this and i as

- [04:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=16949) and i as drop down items

- [04:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=16967) [Music] this we have to inside

- [04:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=16993) when we inspect the code what we see okay we see

- [04:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=16996) okay we see page item

- [04:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=16999) page item and a page item here

- [04:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=17002) and a page item here but it is not visible

- [04:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=17021) okay drop down menu page nation

- [04:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=17025) down menu page nation stop

- [04:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=17070) okay something like oh this is not the case

- [04:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=17072) case let's see

- [04:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=17075) let's see okay someone asked that but i don't see

- [04:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=17077) okay someone asked that but i don't see it yes

- [04:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=17082) this is the regular drop-down menus but it is not working inside the page

- [04:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=17103) maybe we can append it as a nave item here instead of here

- [04:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=17106) here instead of here let's append it to unordered list like

- [04:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=17109) let's append it to unordered list like this

- [04:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=17111) this and let's see what happens

- [04:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=17141) let's make this let's rocket it

- [04:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=17172) let's try this div class

- [04:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=17173) class containers

- [04:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=17205) why it's not visible anywhere i don't understand

- [04:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=17229) yeah so probably these need to be inside active id drop down

- [04:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=17236) maybe that is why we were not able to see it

- [04:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=17240) okay let's make it like this and see what happens

- [04:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=17293) our drop-down menu is not visible

- [04:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=17338) okay drop down toggle type button

- [04:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=17341) type button and

- [04:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=17342) and id drop down menu button

- [04:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=17348) two so

- [04:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=17365) i don't think this id is really important

- [04:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=17371) let's see okay now which is visible yeah

- [04:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=17373) okay now which is visible yeah so this button is necessary

- [04:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=17377) so this button is necessary to display

- [04:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=17379) to display page

- [04:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=17381) page and i will make this as a button

- [04:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=17388) let's say let's remove it it's really default

- [04:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=17399) and yeah

- [04:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=17401) yeah probably we don't even need this id

- [04:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=17404) probably we don't even need this id so let's put this inside our

- [04:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=17408) so let's put this inside our page item

- [04:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=17415) here i will cover it with

- [04:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=17417) i will cover it with as

- [04:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=17418) as an eye

- [04:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=17421) an eye like this

- [04:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=17426) you see as you do copy and pasting

- [04:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=17429) as you do copy and pasting you won't learn it immediately you need

- [04:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=17431) you won't learn it immediately you need to make examples

- [04:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=17433) to make examples and now it is working here

- [04:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=17439) now i can have a page nation like this select page

- [04:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=17443) page nation like this select page jump page whatever i want

- [04:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=17446) jump page whatever i want for example

- [04:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=17452) let's make this as btn

- [04:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=17454) btn um

- [04:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=17461) dark and jump

- [04:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=17463) jump yeah

- [04:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=17479) some class to this instead of drop down item i can i think i can

- [04:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=17482) item i can i think i can make them as

- [04:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=17485) make them as page

- [04:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=17486) page item let's see

- [04:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=17532) okay maybe we can mix them

- [04:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=17533) mix them like this

- [04:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=17546) that's not okay uh we have achieved what we wanted

- [04:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=17549) uh we have achieved what we wanted instead of jump you can also have a drop

- [04:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=17551) instead of jump you can also have a drop down like that you can also have a jump

- [04:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=17553) down like that you can also have a jump button

- [04:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=17554) button it is totally up to you

- [04:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=17571) working with icons so basically you can i think we can put

- [04:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=17573) so basically you can i think we can put anything as an icon here

- [04:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=17576) anything as an icon here let's put our svg

- [04:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=17580) let's put our svg which is um

- [04:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=17598) okay so this is our previous so i just need to

- [04:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=17602) previous so i just need to put a spawn inside here

- [04:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=17632) okay a class page link is this

- [04:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=17634) is this and inside is

- [04:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=17636) and inside is because of here i will just start class

- [04:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=17639) because of here i will just start class equal to

- [04:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=17641) equal to [Music]

- [04:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=17662) okay our previous icon is working as you see i can also change its size with some

- [04:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=17665) see i can also change its size with some styling

- [04:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=17667) styling such as

- [04:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=17668) such as style

- [04:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=17671) style weight equal to

- [04:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=17673) weight equal to 25 pixel

- [04:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=17675) 25 pixel weight equal to 25 pixel

- [04:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=17678) weight equal to 25 pixel it is bothered up to you

- [04:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=17699) so this has got some padding you see and this is the spawn

- [04:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=17718) so you can also add a custom link like this

- [04:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=17719) this and

- [04:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=17721) and i think you need to

- [04:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=17724) i think you need to change padding

- [04:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=17726) change padding to make it better

- [04:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=17807) you see it is not exactly centered there is some extra space at the bottom

- [04:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=17815) i think it is because of the page link so when we get to computers maybe we can

- [04:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=17818) so when we get to computers maybe we can see here

- [04:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=17823) let's see if there's some padding or margin there's some padding mark here

- [04:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=17866) okay so the item inside it is no

- [04:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=17868) no is so based

- [04:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=17874) i don't see what can causing this extra space here

- [04:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=17880) anyway you can make it like this you can

- [04:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=17883) you can make it like this you can look for a solution to fix that as well

- [04:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=17885) look for a solution to fix that as well it is possible probably

- [04:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=17894) instead of this maybe we can just put our

- [04:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=17895) our icon as an image

- [04:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=17897) icon as an image let's try that

- [04:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=17899) let's try that so this is our mutual

- [04:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=17903) so this is our mutual and instead of spawn i will comment this

- [04:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=17906) and instead of spawn i will comment this out

- [04:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=17916) i think this should mean to the root

- [04:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=17923) okay the image is not working because we didn't set any width and heat

- [04:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=17926) didn't set any width and heat since it is uh an svg we need to set

- [04:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=17931) since it is uh an svg we need to set wait and hate for it

- [04:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=17934) wait and hate for it and now

- [04:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=17936) and now it is working without any extra space

- [04:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=17939) it is working without any extra space here

- [04:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=17941) here however it is right position so you need

- [04:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=17944) however it is right position so you need to

- [04:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=17944) to transform it if you want

- [04:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=17947) transform it if you want like here

- [04:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=17959) okay by the way this inline styling is not suggested you should

- [04:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=17962) styling is not suggested you should instead of you should compose a class

- [04:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=17964) instead of you should compose a class now it is

- [04:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=17966) now it is looking almost as

- [04:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=17968) looking almost as exactly same as

- [04:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=17971) exactly same as next

- [04:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=17975) okay 45.51

- [04:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=17982) and this one is 44. so there is still a slight

- [04:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=17993) which is caused by you see it's not equal

- [05:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=18013) i don't know this image may have some

- [05:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=18035) maybe we need to change its size for example here it is

- [05:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=18038) for example here it is 26 pixel oh no i need 24 pixels here

- [05:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=18048) maybe it's 23 pixels it is exactly the same right now

- [05:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=18055) anyway okay

- [05:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=18060) you can also style this link to padding 0 like

- [05:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=18064) style this link to padding 0 like style padding or even instead of this

- [05:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=18067) style padding or even instead of this let's add a class

- [05:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=18070) let's add a class as p0

- [05:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=18088) yeah it becomes like this so now that you can increase its

- [05:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=18091) so now that you can increase its image size to

- [05:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=18094) image size to for example with 100 percent

- [05:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=18097) for example with 100 percent and hate 100 percent

- [05:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=18101) and hate 100 percent actually we can add a class for this yes

- [05:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=18103) actually we can add a class for this yes let's use the classes of bootstrap as we

- [05:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=18108) let's use the classes of bootstrap as we 108

- [05:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=18109) 108 [Music]

- [05:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=18111) [Music] so for eight 100 year here

- [05:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=18115) so for eight 100 year here and let's refresh

- [05:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=18139) um [Music]

- [05:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=18145) so 100 variant good

- [05:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=18152) i think we need to set still maybe we can make 25 first

- [05:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=18171) okay we did spend too much time so i am leaving that to you to find correct

- [05:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=18175) leaving that to you to find correct styling

- [05:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=18177) styling and

- [05:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=18179) and yeah you can also set the pagination

- [05:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=18181) yeah you can also set the pagination size

- [05:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=18183) size like large small beak

- [05:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=18186) like large small beak there's also alignment justify content

- [05:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=18190) there's also alignment justify content centers you see

- [05:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=18197) or justify content and okay

- [05:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=18205) then pop overs we have already see a small example of this

- [05:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UliHXOQh00&t=18213) i think i will end the lecture here so we will be needed to have lecture 17
