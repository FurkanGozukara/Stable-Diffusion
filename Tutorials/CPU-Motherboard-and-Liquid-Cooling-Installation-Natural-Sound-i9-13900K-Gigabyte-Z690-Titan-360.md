### Video Transcription


- [00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD8qwlXiSVI&t=1) Greetings everyone, in this video I will install Core i9-13900K CPU into Gigabyte Z690 motherboard

- [00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD8qwlXiSVI&t=11) along with Titan 360 liquid cooler.

- [00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD8qwlXiSVI&t=13) The video speed is 2x with natural sound.

- [00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD8qwlXiSVI&t=17) At the end of the video I will do a Cinebench CPU testing and show you the temperatures.

- [00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD8qwlXiSVI&t=1744) So the installation took longer than expected because I had used PCI Express pin here instead

- [00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD8qwlXiSVI&t=1751) of this CPU pin and it was causing motherboard to not start.

- [00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD8qwlXiSVI&t=1757) I had to spend a lot of time to figure this out.

- [00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD8qwlXiSVI&t=1761) Unfortunately this caused me to lose a lot of time.

- [00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD8qwlXiSVI&t=1765) So these are the current values by using hardware info.

- [00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD8qwlXiSVI&t=1769) I am right now recording a video therefore it is using some CPU.

- [00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD8qwlXiSVI&t=1774) There are also some other applications running on the background.

- [00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD8qwlXiSVI&t=1778) However I am using in a very powerful mode so the CPU is not in the default settings.

- [00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD8qwlXiSVI&t=1785) We can say that it is overclocked.

- [00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD8qwlXiSVI&t=1788) So these are the settings.

- [00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD8qwlXiSVI&t=1789) Now I will start Cinebench for testing and you will see how much temperature will rise.

- [00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD8qwlXiSVI&t=1795) So let's test with CPU multi-core and let's see the temperatures.

- [00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD8qwlXiSVI&t=1805) You see it already reached 100 degree in some of the cores.

- [00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD8qwlXiSVI&t=1809) As soon as CPU reaches 100 Celsius it bottlenecks the CPU and reduces temperature back.

- [00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD8qwlXiSVI&t=1816) So it never passed 100 Celsius temperature.

- [00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD8qwlXiSVI&t=1819) This CPU is very powerful using a lot of power.

- [00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD8qwlXiSVI&t=1823) Let me show you.

- [00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD8qwlXiSVI&t=1824) So when all of the threads of the CPU are used these are the effective clock speed.

- [00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD8qwlXiSVI&t=1831) These are the clock speeds that we are getting right now.

- [00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD8qwlXiSVI&t=1834) And these are the voltages that CPU is using right now.

- [00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD8qwlXiSVI&t=1837) Also let me show you the power usage of the CPU.

- [00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD8qwlXiSVI&t=1841) So here you are seeing how much power the CPU is using.

- [00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD8qwlXiSVI&t=1844) It is using about 300 watts therefore it is also getting more hot than it should be because

- [00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD8qwlXiSVI&t=1851) I am using in an overclocked mode from the motherboard.

- [00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD8qwlXiSVI&t=1855) Even though I have liquid cooling and even though my case is open these are the temperatures

- [00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD8qwlXiSVI&t=1861) I am getting.

- [00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD8qwlXiSVI&t=1862) By the way the weather temperature is about 25 to 30 degrees right now in the room.

- [00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD8qwlXiSVI&t=1867) However I found out that there is a possible solution for this problem.

- [00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD8qwlXiSVI&t=1871) So it appears that if you purchase a contact frame for LGA1700 you will get better cooling

- [00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD8qwlXiSVI&t=1880) with liquid cooling.

- [00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD8qwlXiSVI&t=1882) Therefore I have purchased a Thermalright CPU contact frame.

- [00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD8qwlXiSVI&t=1885) It already arrived to my home but I haven't installed it yet.

- [00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD8qwlXiSVI&t=1890) Hopefully I will make another video and show you the difference between these and with

- [00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD8qwlXiSVI&t=1894) the default contact frame.

- [00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD8qwlXiSVI&t=1896) I hope you have enjoyed from this video.

- [00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD8qwlXiSVI&t=1898) Normally I am mostly making about AI videos.

- [00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD8qwlXiSVI&t=1902) However I am also making some videos like this.

- [00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD8qwlXiSVI&t=1905) So if you subscribe, like, join, comment I would appreciate that.

- [00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD8qwlXiSVI&t=1909) Without your support I wouldn't be able to purchase this CPU.

- [00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD8qwlXiSVI&t=1912) With your support I am improving my hardware power so that I can produce better quality

- [00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD8qwlXiSVI&t=1917) videos for you.

- [00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD8qwlXiSVI&t=1919) Therefore your support on my Patreon is extremely important.

- [00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD8qwlXiSVI&t=1922) I am also sharing Patreon exclusive content and I already recorded the video that I show

- [00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD8qwlXiSVI&t=1930) the power of new CPU.

- [00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD8qwlXiSVI&t=1932) I compare it with my older CPU.

- [00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD8qwlXiSVI&t=1934) It is already posted on the Patreon but a video coming for that so don't worry if you

- [00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD8qwlXiSVI&t=1938) are not my Patreon supporter you will also have that video.

- [00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD8qwlXiSVI&t=1942) Actually when you are watching this video it should be on the channel.

- [00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD8qwlXiSVI&t=1945) Hopefully see you in another amazing video.
