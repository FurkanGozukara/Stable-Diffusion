VEO 3 has been announced and published by Google DeepMind today. It is literally insane and mind blowing. But in literal sense. There has never been anything like this before. It is able to generate 8 seconds HD videos with ultra realistic and perfect audio. I have collected 60 user generated wild non-cherry pick examples from Twitter. You know seeing the user generated examples is only real compared to hyped releases of publishers.

Google Unveils Veo 3: A Game-Changing AI Video Generator with Native Audio

Published May 21, 2025

At Google I/O 2025, held on May 20‚Äì21 in Mountain View, California, Google announced the launch of Veo 3, its latest AI-powered video generation model, marking a significant leap in creative technology. This third-generation model, succeeding Veo 2, introduces groundbreaking features, most notably its ability to generate high-quality videos with integrated audio, including dialogue, sound effects, and ambient noise. Alongside Veo 3, Google introduced Flow, a new AI-driven video editing suite designed to empower filmmakers and content creators. Here‚Äôs an in-depth look at Veo 3, its capabilities, and its potential to reshape AI filmmaking.

What is Veo 3?

Veo 3 is Google‚Äôs state-of-the-art video generation model, built to create short video clips from text or image prompts. Unlike its predecessors and competitors like OpenAI‚Äôs Sora, Veo 3 stands out for its ability to produce videos with synchronized audio, such as character dialogue, background traffic noise, or birds chirping in a park scene. This advancement addresses a long-standing limitation in AI video generation, where tools could create realistic visuals but lacked integrated sound, often requiring separate audio editing.

The model excels in prompt adherence, accurately interpreting complex instructions to generate scenes with realistic physics, consistent movement, and precise lip-syncing for dialogue. Google claims Veo 3 delivers higher-quality video content than Veo 2, with improved rendering of intricate details like fabrics, water, and animal fur when paired with Google‚Äôs new image generation model, Imagen 4.

Key Features of Veo 3

Native Audio Generation: Veo 3 can produce videos with sound effects, ambient noise, and dialogue, creating a more immersive experience. For example, a prompt describing a bustling city street can yield a clip with honking cars and pedestrian chatter, all generated dynamically.

Enhanced Prompt Accuracy: The model better understands narrative prompts, allowing users to describe short stories or specific actions, which Veo 3 translates into cohesive video clips. This makes it a powerful tool for storytellers and filmmakers.

Realistic Physics and Visuals: Veo 3‚Äôs rendering engine ensures accurate real-world physics, such as fluid motion or object interactions, enhancing the realism of generated content.

Integration with Flow: Google‚Äôs new AI video editing suite, Flow, combines Veo 3, Imagen 4, and the Gemini AI model to streamline video creation. Flow offers features like ‚ÄúCamera Controls‚Äù for manipulating angles, ‚ÄúScenebuilder‚Äù for editing or extending shots, and ‚ÄúAsset Management‚Äù to organize creative elements. A ‚ÄúFlow TV‚Äù showcase highlights videos created with Veo 3, complete with prompts to inspire users.

SynthID Watermarking: To combat misinformation, all Veo 3 outputs are watermarked with Google‚Äôs SynthID, identifying them as AI-generated. Since 2023, SynthID has watermarked over 10 billion pieces of content, ensuring transparency.

Availability and Access

Veo 3 is available as of May 20, 2025, but access is limited to specific platforms and subscription tiers in the United States:

Google AI Ultra Plan ($249.99/month): Subscribers to this premium plan, aimed at AI enthusiasts, can access Veo 3 with native audio generation through the Gemini app and Flow. This plan offers the highest usage limits.

Google AI Pro Plan: This tier provides access to Flow with 100 generations per month and Veo 2, but not Veo 3‚Äôs audio features.

Vertex AI: Enterprise users on Google‚Äôs Vertex AI platform can also leverage Veo 3 for professional applications.

Flow is currently available only to U.S. subscribers of the Pro and Ultra plans, with Google hinting at broader access in the future.

Industry Impact and Partnerships

Veo 3‚Äôs launch coincides with a strategic partnership with acclaimed filmmaker Darren Aronofsky, who is leveraging the technology for his new AI-driven storytelling venture, Primordial Soup.
