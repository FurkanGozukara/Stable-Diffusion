- [00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8WESfPwlYw&t=56) And from this post you need to download all these 3 files in the attachments.

- [00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8WESfPwlYw&t=61) Click every one of them to download one by one.

- [00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8WESfPwlYw&t=69) Okay when you first time install the RunPod enter inside Stable Diffusion Web UI folder.

- [00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8WESfPwlYw&t=74) Click this upload icon.

- [00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8WESfPwlYw&t=77) Upload relauncher.py overwrite.

- [00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8WESfPwlYw&t=92) Just patiently wait.

- [00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8WESfPwlYw&t=93) It should be very very fast.

- [00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8WESfPwlYw&t=96) Okay the restart has been completed.

- [00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8WESfPwlYw&t=100) Then go back to inside workspace.

- [00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8WESfPwlYw&t=104) Upload install files.

- [00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8WESfPwlYw&t=106) You see.

- [00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8WESfPwlYw&t=108) Upload them.

- [00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8WESfPwlYw&t=109) And from this post you will see the scripts that you need to execute.

- [00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8WESfPwlYw&t=113) First select this part.

- [00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8WESfPwlYw&t=116) Copy.

- [00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8WESfPwlYw&t=117) Terminal.

- [00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8WESfPwlYw&t=118) Copy-paste it and wait until you get the Automatic1111 Web UI fully started.

- [00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8WESfPwlYw&t=124) It should be pretty fast actually.

- [00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8WESfPwlYw&t=127) Just wait.

- [00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8WESfPwlYw&t=130) Okay the installation has been completed.

- [00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8WESfPwlYw&t=132) This was only first installation.

- [00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8WESfPwlYw&t=135) Therefore we have some errors.

- [00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8WESfPwlYw&t=136) Now we will install the second part.

- [00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8WESfPwlYw&t=139) So open another terminal.

- [00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8WESfPwlYw&t=140) Go back to the post.

- [00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8WESfPwlYw&t=142) Copy this part.

- [00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8WESfPwlYw&t=144) Copy it.

- [00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8WESfPwlYw&t=145) Copy paste it.

- [00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8WESfPwlYw&t=146) And it will install the second part for the DreamBooth extension of Automatic1111 Web

- [00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8WESfPwlYw&t=152) UI on a RunPod with the perfectly working version.

- [00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8WESfPwlYw&t=156) We are installing perfectly working version right now.

- [00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8WESfPwlYw&t=159) The second installation will be much faster than the first time.

- [00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8WESfPwlYw&t=166) And you will also get this message.

- [00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8WESfPwlYw&t=168) But this is not an error.

- [00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8WESfPwlYw&t=169) We got our Automatic1111 Web UI started.

- [00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8WESfPwlYw&t=173) All I need to do is now let's go back to here.

- [00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8WESfPwlYw&t=177) Click connect.

- [00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8WESfPwlYw&t=178) Connect to HTTP port 3001 and we will get our Automatic1111 Web UI with perfectly working

- [00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8WESfPwlYw&t=185) DreamBooth extension as you are seeing right now.

- [00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8WESfPwlYw&t=188) We have installed specific versions for it to work because the latest version is not

- [00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8WESfPwlYw&t=193) working.

- [00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8WESfPwlYw&t=194) On this instance you can use SD 1.5 based models perfectly fine.

- [00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8WESfPwlYw&t=198) Train them perfectly fine.

- [00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8WESfPwlYw&t=199) But SDXL will not work on this version.

- [00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8WESfPwlYw&t=202) That's it.
