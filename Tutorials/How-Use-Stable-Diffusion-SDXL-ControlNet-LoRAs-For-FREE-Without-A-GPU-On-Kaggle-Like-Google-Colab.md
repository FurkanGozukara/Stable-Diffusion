### Video Transcription


- [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=0) Have you ever wanted to harness the full power of image-generation AI, Stable Diffusion,

- [00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=5) but felt held back by the limitations of your computer or budget?

- [00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=10) Today I have just the solution for you.

- [00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=13) In this comprehensive tutorial, I will guide you through a Kaggle notebook detailing how

- [00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=19) to utilize custom models from CivitAI and Hugging Face such as the renowned Realistic

- [00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=25) Vision.

- [00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=26) Explore the capabilities of Stable Diffusion X-Large commonly referred to as SDXL.

- [00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=33) Implement custom LoRAs from CivitAI like the Pixel Art XL.

- [00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=38) Incorporate your very own trained LoRAs compatible even with SDXL.

- [00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=43) Dive into the advanced extensions of Stable Diffusion ControlNet, tailored for both Stable

- [00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=50) Diffusion 1.5 based models and the SDXL models.

- [00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=56) The SDXL support for Automatic1111 Web UI just arrived today.

- [00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=62) I will show you how to use ControlNet models for SDXL in this tutorial.

- [00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=67) Hopefully, a much more comprehensive tutorial for ControlNet for SDXL is coming.

- [00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=74) Moreover, install any extension you want such as After Detailer.

- [00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=79) And finally, download all of the generated images with just one click.

- [00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=85) The best part, we will achieve all of these by using Kaggle, a leading machine learning

- [00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=92) platform.

- [00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=93) Not only does Kaggle offer free GPU capabilities akin to the Google Colab, but it stands out

- [00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=100) in its generosity.

- [00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=101) With Kaggle, you gain access to powerful T4 GPU for 30 hours weekly, and you are always

- [00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=108) in the know about your usage and refresh times.

- [00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=112) You can follow this tutorial even from your mobile phone.

- [00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=115) You don't even need a computer.

- [00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=118) So if you are ready to elevate your AI capabilities without spending any money, without owning

- [00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=123) a strong GPU, without owning a strong computer, this tutorial is tailor-made for you.

- [00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=129) And we will use the best and most easy to use UI for Stable Diffusion models, Automatic1111

- [00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=136) Web UI.

- [00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=137) It will be exactly as using in your computer like you have a very strong computer.

- [00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=142) I have prepared a very detailed GitHub readme file for this tutorial.

- [00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=147) Everything that you are going to need will be in this file, the links, the codes, and

- [00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=152) everything else.

- [00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=154) I will update this file if it be necessary in future.

- [00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=158) Also, the link of this file will be in the description of the video and also in the pinned

- [00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=163) comments of the video.

- [00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=164) So we will begin with registering and logging in to our Kaggle account.

- [00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=171) If you don't have a Kaggle account, open this link.

- [00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=174) Register with either Google or with email.

- [00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=177) I prefer to register with Google.

- [00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=179) I have already registered my account.

- [00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=182) After you registered your account and logged in, go to settings.

- [00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=185) You can click this link to go to settings.

- [00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=188) And in here, you have to verify your phone number.

- [00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=191) As you are seeing right now, my phone is verified.

- [00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=194) This is necessary to be able to use the free GPUs that the Kaggle provides us.

- [00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=200) If your phone number verification fails for any reason, you can contact the support of

- [00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=206) the Kaggle from this link.

- [00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=208) After registered and logged into your account, we will begin with creating a new notebook.

- [00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=214) Click this create button here and click new notebook.

- [00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=218) It will start a new fresh notebook like you are seeing right now.

- [00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=222) There are two important things before you start.

- [00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=225) First of all, you need to select accelerator from here.

- [00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=229) Select GPU T4 x 2.

- [00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=232) This will provide us dual T4 GPU.

- [00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=236) You see, you can use it 30 hours every week.

- [00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=239) This is amazing.

- [00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=240) This is for free and each week this resets.

- [00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=244) So each week you can use 30 hours this dual GPU.

- [00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=248) These GPUs will be only assigned to you while you are using.

- [00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=252) This is not like Hugging Face spaces if you have ever used them.

- [00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=256) This will be totally reserved to you so you will have full control of these dual GPUs.

- [00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=262) And one another thing is Internet on.

- [00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=264) You need to set Internet on otherwise you will get error.

- [00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=268) You can also select persistence.

- [00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=270) However, this is not working very well in many cases.

- [00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=274) Also, it will slow you down when you start your session, restart your session to reload

- [00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=280) the data.

- [00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=281) But you can also enable persistence if you wish.

- [00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=284) I don't prefer it.

- [00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=286) So what you need to do is you need to delete this code and use the codes I shared here.

- [00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=292) You see, for example, copy this one, paste it and run the notebook.

- [00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=296) Then copy this one, paste it and run the code and continue.

- [00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=301) You can also add new code, copy paste the new code to there like this, and execute them.

- [00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=308) However, if you are my Patreon supporter, which I hope you will be, you can download

- [00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=313) the entire notebook from this link.

- [00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=316) Let me download it.

- [00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=317) When you open this link, you will get to this Patreon page and you can download the notebook

- [00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=323) from this attachment or you can also click here to download.

- [00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=326) The notebook is downloaded.

- [00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=328) Then we are going to click file and import notebook.

- [00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=333) Then browse files, go to download, select the notebook, click import and the entire

- [00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=340) notebook is imported.

- [00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=342) I am going to show entire code in this video.

- [00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=346) So if you are not my Patreon supporter, you can still follow this video perfectly fine

- [00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=352) and you will be able to do everything that we are doing with this notebook because the

- [00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=357) code that is necessary and the instructions are all shared in this GitHub readme file.

- [00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=364) So read this readme file very carefully.

- [00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=366) Moreover, I will update this readme file if it be necessary in future.

- [00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=371) So if it gets broken, just reply to this video or join our Discord channel and ask me questions

- [00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=378) or tell me what is broken.

- [00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=380) Moreover, before starting, I suggest you to check out the suggested resources.

- [00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=385) For example, this link will open the ControlNet extension development for Stable Diffusion

- [00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=393) XL with Automatic1111 Web UI.

- [00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=396) Also, I suggest you to watch this tutorial video where I have shown how to train your

- [00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=403) own Stable Diffusion XL LoRA on a free Kaggle account.

- [00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=407) You can also do Stable Diffusion 1.5 based versions training as well.

- [00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=413) So it is not limited to SDXL.

- [00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=415) Whatever I show is not limited to Stable Diffusion XL.

- [00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=420) SDXL.

- [00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=421) You can do everything with Stable Diffusion 1.5 based versions as well.

- [00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=426) And I also suggest you to watch this ControlNet tutorial.

- [00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=430) This is a huge tutorial where I have shown how to install Automatic1111 Web UI, how to

- [00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=435) install ControlNet, how to download its models, which ControlNet model and option do what.

- [00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=441) So this is a huge tutorial that you should watch.

- [00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=445) After that, you are ready to start following this tutorial.

- [00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=448) First of all, we need to start our session.

- [00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=451) So we click this icon.

- [00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=453) It will start our session.

- [00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=455) Once the session has been started, you will get a green circle here.

- [00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=459) When you click this tab, it will open the session details.

- [00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=464) You see, I am using 4GB of my maximum temporary disk, which is 73GB, which is a huge disk

- [00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=472) space.

- [00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=473) We are using 500MB RAM memory at the moment.

- [00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=476) We are not using any of the GPUs that we have.

- [00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=480) You see, I have 2 GPUs.

- [00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=482) You should also have dual GPU here.

- [00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=484) Then we will begin with installing everything written here.

- [00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=488) This is going to install this library to manage the RAM better in a Kaggle notebook.

- [00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=495) This is going to clone the Stable Diffusion Web UI into our working directory.

- [00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=500) These lines are going to generate these temporary folders because we are going to download ControlNet

- [00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=507) models and the Stable Diffusion models into the temporary disk.

- [00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=510) Because the temporary disk is 70GB.

- [00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=513) However, our working directory is only 20GB.

- [00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=517) Since we have cloned our repo into our working directory, it is now shown here.

- [00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=523) So this right section of the notebook is really important.

- [00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=526) This right section can be hidden and opened back from here as you are seeing right now.

- [00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=532) So the Kaggle working directory is our main directory.

- [00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=536) I will show everything, so don't worry.

- [00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=538) You see, everything were properly installed.

- [00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=541) Let's clear the output.

- [00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=542) So for clearing the output, right click anywhere and clear all outputs and it will clear all

- [00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=547) the output.

- [00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=548) Now the second step.

- [00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=550) In here, I am going to download the SDXL base model, SDXL refiner model, SDXL best VAE model

- [00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=559) into the respected folders.

- [00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=561) I am going to download the main models into the Kaggle temporary models folder because

- [00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=566) as I said, we have much more space in the temporary folder.

- [00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=569) However, I am going to download the best VAE into the working directory.

- [00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=575) Don't worry, these are all explained here.

- [00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=578) The logic is so simple.

- [00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=580) First, you need to find the repository.

- [00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=582) For example Stable Diffusion XL base repository on Hugging Face.

- [00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=587) Then go to the files and versions tab and in here you need to copy the link of the file.

- [00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=593) To copy the download link, you see there is a download arrow here.

- [00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=597) Right click and copy link address.

- [00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=599) Then all you need to do is come here, change this link with that one.

- [00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=605) For example, I deleted it and copy pasted it.

- [00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=608) Then change the model file name that you want it to be saved as.

- [00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=613) You can also change this.

- [00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=614) So with this strategy, you can use any custom model on Hugging Face or even on CivitAI.

- [00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=620) The difference with CivitAI is that it is like this.

- [00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=625) Let me show an example from CivitAI.

- [00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=628) For example, this model.

- [00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=631) This is a pixel art SDXL LoRA.

- [00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=634) Let me open its page from CivitAI.

- [00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=637) So this is the CivitAI page of this LoRA file.

- [00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=641) Either it can be LoRA or it can be model.

- [00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=643) It doesn't matter.

- [00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=644) The logic is same so I am teaching you the logic.

- [00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=647) So to download this, right click here and copy the link address from here.

- [00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=651) Then go back to your notebook, delete this link, paste it.

- [00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=656) You see the link is here.

- [00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=658) And in here, just define its path and the download file name.

- [00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=663) The extension of the file name is really important.

- [00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=665) Since this is a SafeTensors file, I need to make it a SafeTensors extension.

- [00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=672) What if it was a checkpoint like you are seeing Juggernaut XL?

- [00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=677) Still same.

- [00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=678) I just right click, copy the link address.

- [00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=680) And in the Kaggle, then this time I need to download it into the models folder here.

- [00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=686) So I just need to change the download link from here, paste it and download it into the

- [00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=692) models folder with its name.

- [00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=695) If you also reply to the Patreon post and if you need any additional models that you

- [00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=699) need here, I will change and modify the notebook file, update the Patreon post.

- [00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=706) So I will make it easier for you.

- [00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=708) So when I click this link, it will start downloading the models one by one.

- [00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=712) You see the download speed is huge on Kaggle.

- [00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=716) You are seeing 300 megabytes, 200 megabytes at the moment.

- [00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=719) 200 megabytes per second means that actually it is around 2000 megabits per second.

- [00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=726) So this is a huge speed.

- [00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=727) You see the entire SDXL model is being downloaded in just under one minute as you are seeing

- [00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=734) right now.

- [00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=735) So Kaggle is super fast in downloads as well.

- [00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=739) Kaggle is much better than Google Colab if you ask my opinion.

- [00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=744) So the entire download is completed in just 32 seconds for the SDXL main model as you

- [00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=751) are seeing right now.

- [00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=752) 32 seconds.

- [00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=753) So it will download all of the models written here.

- [00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=756) If you don't need any model, just put a hashtag like this in front of it and it will get commented

- [00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=764) out and that line will not be executed.

- [00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=767) So wait until you see this circle has been stopped.

- [00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=771) That means the cell execution has been completed.

- [00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=775) You can only execute one cell at a time.

- [00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=778) This is a rule commonly shared in Google Colab or Kaggle or other similar platforms that

- [00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=785) you may have used or you may use.

- [00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=788) So it is downloading all of the models.

- [00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=790) And you see while that cell is being executed, I have cancel run option here.

- [00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=795) So when you see this option is gone, that means that the cell execution has been completed.

- [00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=802) You can also watch the parameters here.

- [00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=804) You see our disk usage is getting increased.

- [00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=806) Okay, all files have been downloaded.

- [00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=809) You see 7 gigabytes file downloaded in just 51 seconds.

- [00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=813) This is super fast.

- [00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=815) And that cancel run option is not here anymore.

- [00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=819) So I right click and clear all outputs.

- [00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=821) Now the next thing is whether you want to use ControlNet or not.

- [00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=825) The ControlNet is the best extension and the most advanced extension of the Stable Diffusion

- [00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=831) and Automatic1111 Web UI.

- [00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=834) So if you don't know what is ControlNet, as I said, watch this ControlNet tutorial.

- [00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=840) This is a huge tutorial, about 100 minutes fully chaptered.

- [00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=845) So by watching this tutorial, you will learn a lot of things, almost everything about ControlNet.

- [00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=852) Let's begin with downloading the ControlNet for Stable Diffusion X-Large, SDXL.

- [00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=858) This just arrived like yesterday.

- [00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=860) This wasn't supported by Automatic 1111 Web UI.

- [00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=864) However, now Automatic 1111 Web UI also supporting ControlNet models for SDXL.

- [00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=870) Hopefully, I will make a new whole tutorial about ControlNet in SDXL.

- [00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=876) But it is not ready yet.

- [00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=877) So in this tutorial, I will just show an example of how to use it.

- [00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=882) So wait my next tutorial about ControlNet in Stable Diffusion XL when using Automatic1111

- [00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=887) Web UI.

- [00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=888) Previously, you had to use Comfy UI to use SDXL and ControlNet.

- [00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=895) However, now we can both use SDXL Refiner and ControlNet with Automatic 1111 Web UI.

- [00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=902) All thanks to the guy that develops this extension, which is this guy you see.

- [00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=910) The name is Lyumin Zhang.

- [00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=912) I am not sure how am I pronouncing it.

- [00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=915) Lyumin Zhang.

- [00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=916) Yes, he written his pronouns.

- [00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=918) So this guy is an amazing developer.

- [00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=920) You can also read this thread to learn a lot of information regarding Stable Diffusion

- [00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=926) XL ControlNet models.

- [00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=928) Okay, all ControlNet models are downloaded while I was talking in just few minutes because

- [00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=935) of download speed of Kaggle.

- [00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=937) Then I am going to skip this cell for now because this is going to download ControlNet

- [00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=942) models for SD 1.5 based models.

- [00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=944) You see, we are already using 50 GB of our disk space.

- [00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=950) Now, whether you want to use LoRA or not, this is the cell you need.

- [00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=955) We are also going to download the LoRA's into the temporary folder.

- [00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=960) So I will just download the LoRA of this pixel art as an example.

- [00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=965) But you can download and use any LoRA's.

- [00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=967) I will also show example of your trained LoRA's how to use them.

- [00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=972) But let's just begin with a custom LoRA hosted on either CivitAI or HuggingFace.

- [00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=979) Currently I am going to use from CivitAI.

- [00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=982) So the LoRA file is also downloaded.

- [00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=983) It is already very small file only 160 MB.

- [00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=988) And now we are ready.

- [00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=990) These are our Automatic1111 Web UI command line arguments.

- [00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=994) You see xFormers, share and I am giving a custom folder name for the model files.

- [00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1001) Why?

- [00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1002) Because I downloaded models not inside models Stable Diffusion folder, but inside Kaggle

- [00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1007) temporary models folder.

- [00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1009) This is really really important because we are utilizing the temporary folder that Kaggle

- [00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1013) gives us.

- [00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1015) If you use my Patreon Kaggle notebook you don't need to make any changes.

- [00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1019) This is also shared in the GitHub readme file in the bottom as you are seeing right now.

- [00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1024) So don't worry about that either.

- [00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1026) And we are going to start with no-half-vae command because this command is for SDXL.

- [00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1033) I think they also added a new command.

- [00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1036) Let's also find it with you.

- [00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1038) So this is the space where all of the command line arguments are shared.

- [00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1043) Okay it is not written here yet.

- [00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1046) So let's search the repository.

- [00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1048) Okay I couldn't find it.

- [00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1050) Currently they added --medvram-sdxl option which enables the medium VRAM only for SDXL.

- [00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1058) I believe I have seen they added the similar option for VAE as well.

- [00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1064) So let me look one more time.

- [00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1066) Okay I couldn't find it, but we are going to start with no half VAE.

- [00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1071) This is going to make the SD 1.5 based models image generation slower.

- [00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1077) So if you are not going to use SDXL, you should also comment this VAE precision like this.

- [00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1085) But if you are going to use SDXL make it like this.

- [00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1089) Okay let's begin.

- [00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1090) So I will click this cell and start Web UI.

- [00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1093) The first time when you start this cell.

- [00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1096) When you execute this cell, it will install the necessary requirements of the Stable Diffusion

- [00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1102) Automatic1111 Web UI.

- [00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1103) You see it is downloading Torch version 2.0.1.

- [00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1107) So this is only first time installation.

- [00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1112) After that if you just stop this cell and restart it, it won't install the libraries

- [00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1117) again until you restart your session or terminate your session and start again.

- [00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1122) The installation has been completed.

- [00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1124) How will you know?

- [00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1125) You will get this Gradio live link.

- [00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1128) This is really important.

- [00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1129) Let me zoom in.

- [00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1131) This link.

- [00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1132) Open this link.

- [00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1133) After opening this link, you can right click and clear all outputs like this.

- [00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1138) And this cell is still being executed because this is the cell which is running our Automatic1111

- [00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1145) Web UI instance.

- [00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1147) And our instance is getting loaded.

- [00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1149) When you first time load your Web UI the load of the model may take a lot of time because

- [00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1156) we have a very limited RAM as you are seeing here.

- [00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1159) So it has loaded with Realistic Vision version 5.1 because we have also downloaded that model.

- [00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1166) First let's go to the settings.

- [00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1168) Go to the interface in the settings section.

- [00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1172) You will find it here.

- [00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1173) User interface.

- [00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1175) Go to the info quick settings list.

- [00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1178) Type VAE and select SD VAE.

- [00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1180) This is really important because with this we will be able to select which VAE to use.

- [00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1187) Apply settings.

- [00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1188) Then reload UI.

- [00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1190) But before doing that since we are also going to use ControlNet.

- [00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1194) Let's also select its folder.

- [00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1197) So go to the ControlNet tab in here.

- [00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1200) And you see it has extra path to scan for ControlNet models.

- [00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1204) This is really important.

- [00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1205) This is the place where we will set the model folder.

- [00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1209) So the model folder is going to be.

- [00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1212) Let's find it in here.

- [00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1214) Kaggle temp CN models.

- [00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1216) This is the folder we have given.

- [00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1218) You can also define different folder pathing.

- [00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1221) It is totally up to you.

- [00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1223) The Kaggle temp part is the important part.

- [00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1226) Apply settings.

- [00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1227) Now ControlNet will scan this folder.

- [00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1230) Then reload UI.

- [00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1231) When you reload UI you will get a new Gradio public link.

- [00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1235) This won't work anymore.

- [00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1237) So close this.

- [00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1239) Wait link to appear here.

- [00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1241) You see now we got a new public URL for the Gradio live.

- [00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1246) Open it.

- [00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1247) And Automatic1111 Web UI has been started successfully.

- [00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1251) This is now going to work as in your computer as it is running locally.

- [00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1257) But this is going to run on the remote server.

- [00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1260) So nothing will be actually executed in your computer.

- [00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1264) Everything will be executed on the cloud.

- [00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1266) However you will be able to use it as easy as in your computer.

- [00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1271) So let's begin with generating some images with Realistic Vision.

- [00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1274) Therefore I am going to select the best SD 1.5 based models VAE from here.

- [00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1282) If you want to use the embedded VAE of the model you need to select none option from

- [00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1289) this selection.

- [00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1290) You see none.

- [00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1291) When you select none it will use the embedded VAE.

- [00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1294) If you don't know what is VAE just search Google.

- [00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1296) You will get a lot of information.

- [00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1298) So let's generate an example image.

- [00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1300) Photo of an amazing sports car.

- [00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1304) Let's make the resolution 768.

- [00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1306) 768.

- [00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1308) I find that the best sampler is DPM++ 2M SDE Karras.

- [00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1315) So I am going to select it.

- [00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1317) And let's hit generate.

- [00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1318) The first generation may be slower than expected.

- [00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1321) Let's see the speed.

- [00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1322) So you see for the speed I am checking here.

- [00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1325) It is reaching about 2.4 IT per second which is a very very good speed because we are generating

- [00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1331) with a higher resolution.

- [00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1333) When the first time it is generating image, the VAE decomposition decoding part is going

- [00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1340) to take more time as you are seeing right now.

- [00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1343) So it has generated all the steps and now generating the final image.

- [00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1347) So the entire generation took 24 seconds.

- [00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1351) Let's look at the image.

- [00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1352) So this is the image we got.

- [00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1354) We didn't use any negative prompts.

- [00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1356) Let's generate another one.

- [00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1358) Okay it is generating with 2.4 IT per second.

- [00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1362) You see this time VAE didn't take almost any time because it was cached in the RAM memory.

- [00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1368) And this time the total generation took 9 seconds.

- [00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1372) So the first time was 24 seconds.

- [00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1374) The second time is 9 seconds.

- [00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1376) And we got another image.

- [00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1377) When you are running on Kaggle you can also install extensions.

- [00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1382) All you need to do is go to extensions tab.

- [00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1384) Install from let's say available.

- [00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1387) Click load from.

- [00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1388) Let's install After Detailer which is one of the favorite extensions that I have.

- [00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1393) You see After Detailer.

- [00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1394) Click install.

- [00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1396) After you clicked install you should watch what is happening in here.

- [00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1401) This is the command line interface that we have when we are running on our local computer.

- [00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1405) You see it is installing all of the extension requirements.

- [00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1408) And it is successfully installed.

- [00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1411) Also this screen is now unfrozen.

- [00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1413) When we go to text to image tab.

- [00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1415) Why?

- [00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1416) Because we need to reload the UI.

- [00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1417) So I clicked to reload UI.

- [00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1420) It is going to reload the UI.

- [00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1422) You see it is downloading the necessary files for that extension to become available.

- [00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1427) And then I have got a new link.

- [00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1429) Click it.

- [00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1430) Now I have the After Detailer extension installed.

- [00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1433) So it is also supporting extension installation.

- [00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1436) So let's say you have downloaded some CivitAI LoRAs.

- [00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1439) You just need to click here.

- [00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1441) After that you need to click refresh.

- [00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1443) But currently I don't have any Stable Diffusion 1.5 version based LoRA.

- [00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1449) However I have a LoRA for SDXL.

- [00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1453) So to use SDXL LoRA I will first select the SDXL base safetensors from here.

- [00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1460) It is going to take some time to load it because we have a very limited RAM.

- [00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1465) Therefore the model changes are taking some time like one minute.

- [00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1470) Maybe sometimes over one minute.

- [00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1472) Just patiently wait here to fully executed.

- [00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1476) Okay it has been like 110 seconds.

- [00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1479) It is still loading.

- [00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1480) Okay almost done.

- [00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1482) Yes it is finally loaded.

- [00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1484) You should also watch the messages printed here.

- [00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1487) So model loading took a lot of time.

- [00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1490) It says actually 49 seconds but it was more here.

- [00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1493) Then you also need to change the VAE.

- [00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1496) This is really important.

- [00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1498) You need to change it to either none or SDXL VAE.

- [00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1501) Now it is going to load the SDXL VAE.

- [00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1505) You can also watch here and see what is happening.

- [00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1508) You see it is using more RAM because it is going to de-load the previous VAE.

- [00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1512) Okay VAE is loaded.

- [00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1516) Okay now we are ready.

- [00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1517) So let's generate our first image with SDXL base model.

- [00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1522) For SDXL there are several resolutions.

- [00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1525) The very best one is 1024x1024.

- [00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1529) So let's generate photo of an amazing sports car.

- [00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1533) I am going to select DPM++ 2M SDE Karras.

- [00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1538) Let's generate.

- [00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1539) The first generation will be slower just like the previous time I presume.

- [00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1543) However if you don't have a strong GPU this is working very well.

- [00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1547) This speed is very decent.

- [00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1549) With RTX 3090 and a very powerful GPU on my computer I am only getting like 3.5 IT per

- [00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1557) second and this is like 1 IT per second.

- [00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1560) Which is only 3 times slower, but this is totally free.

- [00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1564) You don't spend like $1000 even more for a strong GPU.

- [00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1568) You are able to use this 30 hours every week.

- [00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1571) You see the VAE part is taking a lot of time because it is going to cache the VAE.

- [00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1576) Okay it took total 39 seconds.

- [00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1579) And this is the image we got.

- [00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1581) Let's generate another one and see how much time it is going to take this time.

- [00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1585) So since everything were cached, it is going to take lesser time.

- [00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1589) Let's wait.

- [00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1590) The speed is now 1.15 IT per second.

- [00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1594) Okay 15.

- [00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1595) Okay now this time it took only 19 seconds.

- [00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1599) So it was first time 49 seconds.

- [00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1602) In the second time it is only 19 seconds which is a very, very good timing.

- [00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1607) You can't get this timing in Google Colab.

- [00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1610) You can only get this like timing in a very strong computer.

- [00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1613) Now we can use the first LoRA which we downloaded from the CivitAI.

- [00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1619) So I click the LoRA tab.

- [00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1621) I click refresh.

- [00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1622) Now that LoRA should appear.

- [00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1624) Okay you see it has appeared.

- [00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1625) Let's append it and let's try to generate this image.

- [00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1629) So I click info.

- [00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1630) I copy the prompt.

- [00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1632) Let's copy paste it.

- [00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1634) Let's add the LoRA name and let's copy paste the negative prompt and paste it.

- [00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1639) So let's hit generate.

- [00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1640) Okay let's see the speed.

- [00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1642) Since we have added LoRA.

- [00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1644) It will be probably slower than the previous time.

- [00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1647) But I will generate two images and see the final speed when we are using LoRA.

- [00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1653) It is looking still very decent.

- [00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1655) All right it took 20 seconds so we didn't lose much speed and we got a picture.

- [00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1659) Okay it is working very well.

- [00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1661) How about if you want to use the your own trained LoRAs.

- [00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1667) Please watch this tutorial to learn how you can train your own LoRAs on a free Kaggle

- [00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1672) account.

- [00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1673) Currently I have my LoRAs uploaded into my data sets.

- [00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1678) These are private so to upload your own models, ownb LoRAs you just need to click this icon.

- [00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1685) Enter a title.

- [00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1687) Don't enter non-English characters.

- [00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1689) So let's say test 111 LoRA.

- [00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1693) Then select browse files.

- [00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1695) I have my last training LoRAs inside here, inside models, inside LoRA.

- [00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1700) Okay, I have test Kaggle LoRA.

- [00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1702) I will just going to upload it.

- [00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1704) Open it.

- [00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1705) It is going to get uploaded.

- [00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1707) This totally depends on your upload speed.

- [00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1709) Let's look at the upload speed from performance.

- [00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1713) Okay it is uploading with my full speed.

- [00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1715) It is 20 megabits per second.

- [00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1717) This is my upload speed.

- [00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1719) Okay the upload has been completed.

- [00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1720) Now I will click create.

- [00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1722) This will be private so no one else will have access to it.

- [00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1726) It is test 111 LoRA.

- [00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1728) Okay it was success.

- [00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1730) However we can't use it directly.

- [00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1732) You see it is getting added into my current session.

- [00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1736) You can also use your uploaded data sets, your files in every other session that you

- [00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1741) may have in future.

- [00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1743) All you need to do is click this add data.

- [00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1746) Select your data sets and click the plus icon here and then they will get added into this

- [00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1752) session.

- [00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1753) For example: let's also add class images from my previous video.

- [00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1756) You see it is going to get preparing to download and they will get added into my session.

- [00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1761) However we can't directly use this new LoRA.

- [00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1764) Why?

- [00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1765) Because our LoRA folder is not this one.

- [00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1769) It is using the default LoRA folder at the moment.

- [00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1771) So how am I going to use my new LoRA?

- [00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1774) First of all you need to click either cancel run or this cell execution.

- [00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1780) So let's click cancel run.

- [00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1781) Let's clear all of the outputs.

- [00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1784) Clear all outputs.

- [00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1785) Then copy the path of this LoRA and paste it here.

- [00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1790) Then I need to remove this # so it will get uncommented.

- [00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1796) And now the Automatic1111 Web UI will look this folder for LoRA files.

- [00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1802) However we have now some residual RAM.

- [00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1805) You see it is using 3 GB RAM.

- [00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1808) Unfortunately I couldn't find how to clear this RAM usage.

- [00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1812) Even though I have installed this library, it is still using some RAM when it shouldn't

- [00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1819) use any.

- [00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1820) But let's try and see if it will work.

- [00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1823) So we will start another instance of the Automatic1111 Web UI.

- [00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1829) This time it won't install the libraries again because it was already installed and we didn't

- [00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1835) restart our session or we didn't terminate our session.

- [00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1839) Okay it is getting started.

- [00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1841) This start should be very fast.

- [00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1843) Yes it is getting started in like 30 seconds.

- [00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1845) Maybe under one minute.

- [00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1847) I am not sure.

- [00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1848) Let's wait.

- [00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1849) Yeah it took like 32 seconds and now we got our new link.

- [00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1854) Let's open it.

- [00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1855) Okay it is loaded with the SDXL base model file and the VAE.

- [00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1861) Okay it is not using much RAM.

- [00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1862) That is very good.

- [00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1864) So let's use our new LoRA.

- [00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1866) So I am going to use this prompt.

- [00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1868) This is my LoRA activation tokens.

- [00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1871) If you watch the other tutorial.

- [00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1873) you will learn what is it.

- [00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1874) Let's select our sampler.

- [00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1877) Let's make the resolution 1024x1024.

- [00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1879) This is the resolution that I trained.

- [00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1882) Then I need to add my LoRA.

- [00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1883) So click LoRA and now you see that LoRA is loaded.

- [00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1887) Let's click it.

- [00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1888) Let's generate 12 images and see which one will be very good.

- [00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1893) Also I will enable After Detailer and I will just use this prompt when inpainting the face.

- [00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1901) So let's copy this, paste it and let's delete this part.

- [00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1905) Okay so this will inpaint the face.

- [00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1907) I will also make the inpainting denoise strength to 50% like this.

- [00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1913) Okay let's hit generate and let's watch the progress in here.

- [00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1918) After this I will show ControlNet.

- [00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1921) How to use ControlNet.

- [00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1922) When the first time we generate after we restarted our Automatic1111 Web UI it will take a lot

- [00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1929) of time.

- [00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1930) It is also loading the LoRA weights.

- [00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1931) Okay it is started.

- [00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1933) The first time is slow as expected, but not very slow.

- [00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1936) This is a 32 rank dimension having LoRA.

- [00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1940) This was trained for SDXL on a free Kaggle account.

- [00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1944) As I said watch this tutorial to learn how you can train your own LoRA's.

- [00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1948) They can be style, they can be person, your face, anything.

- [00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1953) Okay in the first generation it is taking time at the VAE.

- [00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1957) Then it will cache the VAE and it will become much faster.

- [00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1962) Okay let's see the second one.

- [00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1965) But first it is inpainting the face because we are using After Detailer.

- [00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1969) It is also working very well as we are seeing right now.

- [00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1972) This is the first time run.

- [00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1973) Then it will move to the next.

- [00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1976) Okay it moved to the next one.

- [00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1977) Now it is much faster.

- [00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1978) You can see the speed comparison.

- [00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1981) By the way if you are wondering where are the outputs are saved.

- [00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1985) They are saved inside the Kaggle working.

- [00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1988) Inside Stable Diffusion Web UI.

- [00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1991) Inside outputs folder.

- [00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1993) Inside text to images folder.

- [00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1995) And we will see our outputs.

- [00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=1997) This is working exactly as it would work in your computer.

- [00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2000) When you click here.

- [00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2002) You will see all of the generated images.

- [00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2005) Here you can download them.

- [00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2007) So to download them, go to here.

- [00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2009) Right click and click download.

- [00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2010) And it will download the image.

- [00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2013) Let's open it so I click it.

- [00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2014) And you see this is the previous image we generated.

- [00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2018) The new images will also appear here when I refresh.

- [00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2022) You see the new one has arrived.

- [00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2023) Okay the speed is very decent.

- [00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2025) It is taking only 17 seconds to generate each image.

- [00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2029) Then 18 seconds.

- [00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2031) Of course, the face inpainting is also taking time.

- [00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2033) It is taking like 10 seconds.

- [00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2035) So total image generation is being like 28 seconds right now.

- [00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2041) This is 1024x1024.

- [00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2043) So this is a really high resolution when you consider Stable Diffusion SD 1.5 models.

- [00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2049) You can also watch the progress here.

- [00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2051) So all of the images have been generated.

- [00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2053) The LoRA is working.

- [00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2054) This was a very simple prompt.

- [00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2056) So therefore, the results are not very good.

- [00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2058) But the LoRA is working.

- [00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2060) Now we can begin testing the ControlNet of Stable Diffusion.

- [00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2066) How are we going to do that?

- [00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2068) So I will disable After Detailer and I will open ControlNet.

- [00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2071) This is the ControlNet interface.

- [00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2074) To learn more about ControlNet please watch this master tutorial.

- [00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2079) Hopefully I will also make a very comprehensive tutorial about Stable Diffusion XL ControlNet

- [00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2085) options.

- [00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2086) But they are pretty much similar.

- [00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2089) So let's also clear all outputs here.

- [00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2091) And let's load a beginning image.

- [00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2094) So I will use my this image.

- [00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2096) I will use this as a Canny.

- [00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2099) So let's select Canny.

- [00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2100) And you see it is automatically seeing the Diffusers XL Canny full model.

- [00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2105) Where you can download these models yourself if you are not my Patreon supporter?

- [00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2109) They are all shared in this Hugging Face repository.

- [00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2113) The link is in the GitHub readme file.

- [00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2115) That is why it is really important to read this readme file.

- [00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2119) Okay Canny is selected.

- [00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2121) Canny model is selected.

- [00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2123) Let's enable preview.

- [00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2125) So when I click this, it will show me the preview of this image as a Canny preprocessed.

- [00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2131) You see like this.

- [00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2132) Let's also enable Pixel Perfect.

- [00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2134) And we are ready.

- [00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2135) Now we can generate a new image based on this image.

- [00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2140) So I will use my own LoRA and this prompt.

- [00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2144) And let's generate one image.

- [00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2146) Maybe two images.

- [00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2147) And see the results.

- [00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2149) It should be as in this format.

- [00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2153) Okay let's look at the output of the command line.

- [00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2157) Equivalent of the command line.

- [00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2159) So it is going to load the SDXL config for ControlNet.

- [00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2163) Since this is first time using.

- [00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2166) By the way it is going to use more RAM because now it is combined with LoRA and the ControlNet

- [00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2173) Okay we got a connection error.

- [00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2176) Okay.

- [00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2177) Okay, so what can we do since we have a connection error?

- [00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2180) We can reload the browser and see if it is working.

- [00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2185) Okay it is not working.

- [00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2187) So we need to restart the Web UI instance.

- [00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2191) So I will click cancel run.

- [00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2192) This is all because of the limited RAM it provides.

- [00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2197) Yeah we are having a RAM problem and it is not able to cancel run.

- [00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2201) So sometimes you may encounter similar issues.

- [00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2205) Sometimes the only solution could be restarting the entire session.

- [00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2209) Be prepared for it.

- [00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2211) When you also combine more things you may also get such out of RAM errors.

- [00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2218) Okay it was restarted.

- [00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2219) Okay very nice.

- [00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2220) Now our RAM usage is dropped a lot.

- [00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2223) It is entirely cleared.

- [00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2225) Let's clear all of the output.

- [00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2227) Clear all outputs.

- [00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2229) Restart our Automatic1111 Web UI session.

- [00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2232) Remember if you click this or click this, you will start from beginning.

- [00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2236) You will install everything from beginning.

- [00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2238) Okay it is going to start the instance pretty quickly.

- [00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2242) Okay we got the new Gradio live link.

- [00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2244) Let's open it.

- [00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2245) It is getting loaded.

- [00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2246) Alright so let's go to ControlNet.

- [00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2249) Reload the image.

- [00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2251) Maybe let's use this one.

- [00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2253) Not that one.

- [00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2254) So I will select Pixel Perfect.

- [00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2256) Then I will select Canny.

- [00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2257) Okay it is selected.

- [00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2259) Let's say photo of a very famous and very handsome actor.

- [00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2266) Or let's say very handsome male actor.

- [00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2270) Let's change this to 1024 1024.

- [00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2274) Let's change the sampling method and let's generate 4 images.

- [00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2279) Okay everything looking good.

- [00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2280) Make sure that you have enabled the ControlNet.

- [00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2283) And selected the correct model and the preprocessor.

- [00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2286) Let's watch the status here.

- [00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2288) So the first time it will cache into RAM.

- [00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2291) I am spending huge time to prepare these tutorials.

- [00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2295) These easy to use scripts for you.

- [00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2298) So I appreciate that if you support me on Patreon or with other ways that you wish.

- [00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2303) You can also support me with cryptocurrency if you wish.

- [00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2306) So I am open to every support or you can support me by purchasing my Udemy course.

- [00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2311) Or giving me a Coffee or sponsoring me on GitHub.

- [00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2315) All of them are available in the GitHub repository.

- [00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2319) All of the links are here.

- [00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2320) If you also go to this Stable Diffusion link and Star our repository I would appreciate

- [00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2326) that very much.

- [00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2327) We are almost 1,000 stars.

- [00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2329) It is all thanks to you.

- [00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2330) You can also fork this, watch this and sponsor me from here.

- [00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2334) Okay the image is being generated.

- [00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2337) And we can see the progress here.

- [00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2339) It is not also using a lot of RAM.

- [00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2342) So it also freed up the previously 3 GB RAM.

- [00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2345) If you remember we had 3 GB RAM usage even though it should have been zero.

- [00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2350) Okay the images are getting generated.

- [00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2353) By the way ControlNet developer is doing a lot of updates all the time.

- [00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2358) At this moment he could have made updates.

- [00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2361) Let's look at the discussion thread from here.

- [00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2365) So it is not perfect yet.

- [00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2367) But he is working very hard.

- [00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2369) You see his last reply is 1 hour ago.

- [00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2373) So therefore, when you are watching this tutorial, it could be much better.

- [00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2378) All right, we are getting some results.

- [00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2381) So it should be much faster in the second image.

- [00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2384) The first image took 25 seconds.

- [00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2386) Actually the first image took 31 seconds.

- [00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2389) Then 25 seconds.

- [00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2391) Then it is 26 seconds.

- [00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2393) Yeah.

- [00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2394) And we are using the best Canny model.

- [00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2396) Diffusers XL Canny full.

- [00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2398) There are also smaller models hosted on the Hugging Face.

- [00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2401) You can also download and use them.

- [00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2403) We are generating 4 images.

- [00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2405) Okay we got the results.

- [00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2407) Let's see.

- [00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2408) Okay this is the first result.

- [00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2410) You see it is almost same picture.

- [00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2414) And this is second result.

- [00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2415) Third and the fourth.

- [00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2417) And this was the used Canny preprocessed map.

- [00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2420) I think this is because of the selected options error.

- [00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2425) I also made several test sets.

- [00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2427) So let's test with my prompt is more important and compare the results.

- [00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2432) I will use the same seed.

- [00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2434) So I click this icon.

- [00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2435) It will use the same seed.

- [00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2437) You see.

- [00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2438) Let's see the results.

- [00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2439) Okay this time the results are pretty significantly different.

- [00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2443) So let's look at them.

- [00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2444) First, second, third and fourth.

- [00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2448) How well it can keep the shape of the input is amazing.

- [00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2453) You see.

- [00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2454) Almost perfect hands.

- [00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2456) Almost perfect hand composition.

- [00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2458) The face direction.

- [00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2459) It is superb.

- [00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2461) So after I have investigated all of the ControlNet options hopefully I will make an amazing tutorial

- [00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2468) for ControlNet for Stable Diffusion XL.

- [00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2470) Let's say you want to use ControlNet for SD 1.5 based versions.

- [00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2475) So what you can do?

- [00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2477) Let's clear all outputs.

- [00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2479) Let's stop this cell execution.

- [00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2482) Instead of starting from zero I will delete the temporary folder models.

- [00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2489) However you can just click this and restart from beginning.

- [00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2493) So I will type here a new command.

- [00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2496) Which will be equal to rm -r and the path.

- [00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2501) Actually I will add this into this command.

- [00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2504) So you will be able to use this command when you are downloading from my Patreon.

- [00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2511) Therefore you won't be needed to restart your session.

- [00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2515) It will delete the older files and redownload them.

- [00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2519) And this should get better.

- [00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2521) Let's see.

- [00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2522) Okay it is showing like this.

- [00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2523) But let's execute and download all of the Stable Diffusion 1.5 based models.

- [00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2528) And see if we will get sufficient space.

- [00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2532) Okay it says that it already exists.

- [00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2534) It is fine.

- [00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2536) And okay, yeah.

- [00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2538) The problem is I know the problem.

- [00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2540) So I also need to add this command to here.

- [00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2544) So let's delete this cell.

- [00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2547) Then add this here.

- [00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2549) And also add this here.

- [00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2552) Alright.

- [00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2553) And now let's clear all of the outputs.

- [00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2556) And execute this again.

- [00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2557) You won't need to do these changes when you are watching this tutorial.

- [00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2562) Just download the notebook file and you will have this command ready.

- [00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2567) So it did delete the older files from the disk space.

- [00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2572) And then it is going to download the SD 1.5 ControlNet model files.

- [00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2577) But it is still showing the disk space utilization high.

- [00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2581) This shouldn't happen actually.

- [00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2583) Because we deleted the older file.

- [00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2586) I think it didn't fully delete them.

- [00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2588) Yeah this is weird.

- [00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2590) But let's see what happens.

- [00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2591) If we get out of disk space error I will just start from the scratch.

- [00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2597) I think it did put them into the trash bin.

- [00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2602) Which shouldn't happen but it looks like it happened.

- [00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2605) Let's see what will happen when we fully use it.

- [00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2607) The download speed is amazing.

- [00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2609) So it is not a problem if we start from the beginning.

- [00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2612) Okay we are almost full.

- [00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2614) Yeah I think we will get out of error.

- [00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2617) Okay it says that you are approaching the limit of disk space outside Kaggle working.

- [00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2622) Continued use may cause your notebook to crash.

- [00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2625) Let's see if it will crash or it will give us some extra space.

- [00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2628) Okay it downloaded all of the models.

- [00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2631) Also our removal didn't remove the space.

- [00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2635) So I won't add that line in the Kaggle notebook.

- [00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2638) However it is allowing us to use 80 GB so there is some probably flexibility.

- [00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2645) Let's restart our Web UI.

- [00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2648) So probably we didn't need to stop our..

- [00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2651) Oh we had to stop our Web UI instance because otherwise we wouldn't be able to execute this

- [00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2657) cell.

- [00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2658) That means when you are watching this tutorial, you can download both of the model files at

- [00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2663) the same time since it allowed us to use 80 GB instead of max 73 GB which is nice.

- [00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2671) Okay it is getting started and it started.

- [00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2674) Let's open it.

- [00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2675) Since this time we are going to use ControlNet models based on Stable Diffusion 1.5 based

- [00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2681) models I am going to change the base model.

- [00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2684) I am going to use Realistic Vision 5.1.

- [00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2688) You can also use the base SD 1.5 model as well.

- [00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2692) It is also automatically downloaded.

- [00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2693) Okay let's see message.

- [00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2695) Okay it says that it was a runtime error.

- [00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2699) Okay let's try again because sometimes we may get this error.

- [00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2703) We may get such errors.

- [00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2705) Okay let's just wait.

- [00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2707) Okay it is loading the VAE.

- [00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2709) We will also change the VAE.

- [00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2711) Okay model loaded I think.

- [00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2713) Yeah we got another error.

- [00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2716) I think this is because of the VAE.

- [00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2717) Maybe let's first set the VAE none.

- [00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2721) Okay then change the model.

- [00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2724) This could be due to we are out of HDD.

- [00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2729) Actually it shows the HDD here as green.

- [00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2732) Maybe because of the it is displaying output not temporary.

- [00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2736) Okay it is loading.

- [00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2739) You see I will not cut these parts of the video because you may also encounter same

- [00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2744) problems and you will learn how to solve them.

- [00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2747) This is really important.

- [00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2748) This is why you shouldn't skip my tutorials.

- [00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2752) You should watch them entirely.

- [00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2754) Okay this time it is loaded.

- [00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2755) So first I made the VAE none, then reloaded the model and then let's select the best VAE

- [00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2762) from the VAE selection.

- [00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2764) Okay it is loaded.

- [00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2765) Now we are ready.

- [00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2767) So let's use 1.5 based ControlNet models.

- [00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2771) I will use the same image.

- [00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2774) You see enable Pixel Perfect.

- [00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2776) Okay then select Canny.

- [00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2778) Let's see which model it will select.

- [00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2779) Okay by default it has selected the SD 1.5 version based Canny model as you are seeing

- [00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2786) right now.

- [00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2787) Let's also make the my prompt is more important and let's use the same prompt.

- [00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2792) You can click this but I wonder if it will change the Stable Diffusion checkpoint.

- [00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2796) Let's try.

- [00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2797) This should load the last used prompt.

- [00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2800) Okay it didn't load.

- [00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2802) Yeah so I will download the last generated image.

- [00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2807) I just click this refresh icon to it to expand the folder output.

- [00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2813) Okay I think the last file is 23.

- [00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2816) Yeah they are not sorted by name, so let's download.

- [00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2820) Then let's go to png info.

- [00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2822) Load the image.

- [00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2823) We should see the prompt here.

- [00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2825) Yes this was the prompt.

- [00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2828) Let's type it.

- [00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2829) Okay and since this is Realistic Vision, which one we should use.

- [00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2834) Okay let's use 512 to 512.

- [00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2839) Let's see the message here.

- [00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2840) Okay it is going to load the ControlNet model.

- [00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2843) It is loading the model, loading everything.

- [00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2846) The generation will be much faster of course because it's a lower resolution.

- [00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2850) And we got the output and this is the Realistic Vision output with this Canny.

- [00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2857) You can also see the Canny preprocessor.

- [00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2859) So this is the Canny preprocessor of the ControlNet extension.

- [00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2863) I don't know if the preprocessor output is changing based on either it is SD 1.5 model

- [00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2870) or SDXL model.

- [00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2871) I think it wouldn't change but I haven't compared.

- [00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2874) So I don't think so anything left except one thing.

- [00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2877) What if if we want to download all of the generated images.

- [00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2881) To do that I have a pretty easy script here.

- [00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2885) So to be able to execute this cell, you see I am not able to execute it right now because

- [00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2891) it is running another cell at the moment.

- [00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2894) So I cancel run.

- [00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2896) After canceling run you may get such messages.

- [00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2898) It is not important.

- [00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2899) Clear all outputs.

- [00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2901) Then this cell execution will begin.

- [00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2903) What this cell is going to do is it is going to zip entire outputs folder into the Kaggle

- [00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2911) working directory with the name of generatedimages.zip file.

- [00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2915) So you see it is zipped.

- [00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2917) It is 62 megabytes because we didn't generate too many images.

- [00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2921) So I click here and click download and I will download all of the images.

- [00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2926) If you download multiple files it will ask you to allow multiple files download from

- [00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2932) somewhere around here.

- [00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2934) So pay attention to it and allow it.

- [00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2937) Otherwise you won't be able to download multiple files, download any files.

- [00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2942) So let's look at the inside of this downloaded folder.

- [00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2945) I will extract it.

- [00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2947) To extract it right click and extract.

- [00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2949) I am using Winrar but on Windows you can also directly extract or if you can't extract,

- [00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2955) you can install Winrar.

- [00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2957) So extract generated images.

- [00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2958) So they are here.

- [00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2960) You see text to image grids and text to image images.

- [00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2963) It has downloaded both grid images.

- [00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2965) You see the grid images we generated and let's go back and all of the images we generated

- [00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2972) in this tutorial are here.

- [00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2975) And finally, when you are done, you need to click this and it will terminate your session

- [00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2980) and delete all of the data if you didn't select persistence.

- [00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2985) Everything here will be deleted.

- [00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2987) Only the data sets you upload will remain.

- [00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2990) Okay let's terminate and we have turned off our session.

- [00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=2994) Everything deleted and still I have 20 hours this week GPU time.

- [00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpM02YMj8FY&t=3000) Next week it will get reset.
