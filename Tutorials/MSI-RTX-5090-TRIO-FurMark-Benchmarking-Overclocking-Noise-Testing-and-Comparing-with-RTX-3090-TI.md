I have early purchased MSI RTX 5090 32G GAMING TRIO OC GPU to bring tests, benchmarks and experiments as I have promised. This is my introduction video to the GPU and first review. Hopefully many more amazing ones are coming very soon especially for Generative AI APPs and models. Moreover I am keeping my Gainward RTX 3090 Ti Phantom on the machine so that I can test and compare both GPUs.

In this video I will be FurMark testing both of the GPUs. Then I will overclock RTX 5090 and re-test. Then I will compare all test results. Furthermore I will do stress test of the both of the GPUs, checkout the temperatures and fan levels and I will compare their noise level.

### Video Transcription


- [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uV3oqdILOmA&t=0) Greetings everyone. As I have promised, I have&nbsp; purchased RTX 5090 and today I am starting

- [00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uV3oqdILOmA&t=8) experimentation and benchmarking with it. I have&nbsp; paid 4,000 US dollars. It was really expensive,

- [00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uV3oqdILOmA&t=16) but as I have promised, I have purchased it&nbsp; for testing and benchmarking for you guys.

- [00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uV3oqdILOmA&t=23) So currently, the GPU is mounted into my new&nbsp; case as you are seeing right now. This is RTX

- [00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uV3oqdILOmA&t=30) 5090 and this is my older RTX 3090 Ti. I will be&nbsp; doing experimentation and benchmarking with both

- [00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uV3oqdILOmA&t=40) of the GPUs. Therefore, I am keeping both of&nbsp; them on my case as you are seeing right now.

- [00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uV3oqdILOmA&t=47) Here you are seeing, I am holding both of the&nbsp; GPUs. So this is RTX 3090 Ti and this is the

- [00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uV3oqdILOmA&t=53) RTX 5090. The brand I have purchased&nbsp; is MSI Gaming Trio Overclock Edition,

- [00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uV3oqdILOmA&t=61) as you are seeing. Here few side by side&nbsp; comparison of RTX 5090 versus RTX 3090 Ti.

- [00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uV3oqdILOmA&t=70) Here another view of the both GPUs. Here another&nbsp; view of the both GPUs and here another view. So

- [00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uV3oqdILOmA&t=78) now I will begin FurMark testing. I will also&nbsp; do some overclocking and I will also show you

- [00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uV3oqdILOmA&t=84) the noise level of the GPU while it is running&nbsp; at 100% load. So let's start the FurMark.

- [00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uV3oqdILOmA&t=93) Before I run all 3 benchmarks, I want to&nbsp; show you how it looks because when I benchmark,

- [00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uV3oqdILOmA&t=100) OBS studio is not able to record the screen.&nbsp; So currently you are seeing its values. It is

- [00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uV3oqdILOmA&t=106) doing over 200 FPS usually. The average is 211&nbsp; FPS. I am also recording a video. Therefore,

- [00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uV3oqdILOmA&t=117) it is not at its maximum performance, but this is&nbsp; running at 4K resolution and this is just amazing.

- [00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uV3oqdILOmA&t=127) And here, let me also show you&nbsp; GPU-Z values while it is running,

- [00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uV3oqdILOmA&t=133) while it is under load. I have done a quite&nbsp; long test before this video. I let it run

- [00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uV3oqdILOmA&t=140) 40 minutes and it went up to 79 Celsius&nbsp; with the maximum fan speed of 37%. It is

- [00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uV3oqdILOmA&t=149) just extremely silent, quiet and&nbsp; cool. So this GPU is just amazing.

- [00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uV3oqdILOmA&t=156) Now, let me do the tests and&nbsp; show you the results. All right,

- [00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uV3oqdILOmA&t=161) all 3 tests have been completed. We&nbsp; got 14K score in 4K resolution. We got

- [00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uV3oqdILOmA&t=170) 23,700 score at 1440 resolution and we got 30K&nbsp; score at 1080 resolution. Now I will do some

- [00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uV3oqdILOmA&t=182) overclock and repeat the experimentation.&nbsp; How much overclock that I am going to do?

- [00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uV3oqdILOmA&t=189) I am going to go with some safe values. So&nbsp; for memory, I am going to do 1,500 MHz and for

- [00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uV3oqdILOmA&t=199) GPU core clock, I am going to do 300. Apply and&nbsp; now they are applied and I will repeat the tests

- [00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uV3oqdILOmA&t=207) and show you the results. Then I will show you&nbsp; results of RTX 3090 Ti and then the noise levels.

- [00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uV3oqdILOmA&t=215) Okay, we got the overclocked results from 14,000&nbsp; to 14,400 and this is the new score for 1440k and

- [00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uV3oqdILOmA&t=228) this is the new score for 1080. I will make a&nbsp; graph at the end of the video. As a next step,

- [00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uV3oqdILOmA&t=233) let me demonstrate you how to&nbsp; run FurMark at my second GPU,

- [00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uV3oqdILOmA&t=240) which is RTX 3090 Ti, as I have told you and see&nbsp; how it performs. So to do that, I will right click

- [00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uV3oqdILOmA&t=249) and from here show more options and I will say&nbsp; render OpenGL on RTX 3090 Ti. And this way I will

- [00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uV3oqdILOmA&t=260) be able to use it on my second GPU even though it&nbsp; shows here like this, it is not accurate. Click

- [00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uV3oqdILOmA&t=267) run. And you will see that now it is using my RTX&nbsp; 3090 Ti and this is its FPS. I will run the tests

- [00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uV3oqdILOmA&t=277) on RTX 3090 Ti as well so that we will see the&nbsp; score comparison. I will make a graph at the end.

- [00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uV3oqdILOmA&t=285) However, as soon as I start the benchmark on RTX&nbsp; 3090 Ti, I start hearing its fan noise. This is

- [00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uV3oqdILOmA&t=293) yeah, this is bad. You can see it is increasing&nbsp; the fan as any second passes. This is much more

- [00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uV3oqdILOmA&t=300) noisy than RTX 5090. I will show you also the&nbsp; noise comparison at the end. So keep watching.

- [00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uV3oqdILOmA&t=309) All right, I have completed testing and&nbsp; I have prepared a chart for you. We can

- [00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uV3oqdILOmA&t=315) see the results as like this. So these&nbsp; are the default clock speeds of the GPU.

- [00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uV3oqdILOmA&t=323) These are the slight overclocking that&nbsp; I have made, 300 plus GPU core clock and

- [00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uV3oqdILOmA&t=330) 1,500 plus memory clock. So these are the three&nbsp; scores and these are the 3090 Ti scores. However,

- [00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uV3oqdILOmA&t=340) 3090 could be bottlenecking because of the PCI&nbsp; Express lane speed. Unfortunately, 3090 Ti is

- [00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uV3oqdILOmA&t=351) running only at X4, not X16. Therefore, it could&nbsp; be bottlenecking. So this is the chart as a table.

- [00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uV3oqdILOmA&t=360) You can see that overclock percentage is estimated&nbsp; based on boost clock of 2,400 MHz for the RTX 5090

- [00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uV3oqdILOmA&t=370) and 1,860 MHz for the RTX 3090 Ti. So these are&nbsp; the overclock percentages. We can see that MSI

- [00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uV3oqdILOmA&t=378) is coming with slightly boosted clocks already&nbsp; and I did more overclocking like this. However,

- [00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uV3oqdILOmA&t=385) since they are dynamic, you see they are&nbsp; changing according to the resolution. I

- [00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uV3oqdILOmA&t=389) also noticed that when you are at a lower&nbsp; resolution, it is able to run with higher

- [00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uV3oqdILOmA&t=395) base clocks compared to the higher resolution&nbsp; when running FurMark. Now I will run them for

- [00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uV3oqdILOmA&t=401) a while and I will show you their noise&nbsp; levels under load. I will run them on FurMark

- [00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uV3oqdILOmA&t=407) and I will record them with my phone and&nbsp; I will show you their noise level. Let's see.

- [00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uV3oqdILOmA&t=425) All right, it has been over 17 minutes&nbsp; of running stress test on RTX 5090 and

- [00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uV3oqdILOmA&t=435) you see this is the noise it has. Because the&nbsp; fan speed is only at 37% and the temperatures

- [00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uV3oqdILOmA&t=444) are great. Let me show you. Currently I am&nbsp; running with boosted memory clock and core

- [00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uV3oqdILOmA&t=451) clock and it has been over 18 minutes now&nbsp; and you see the temperature is 78 Celsius.

- [00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uV3oqdILOmA&t=461) The fan speed is only 37 percentage. So this is&nbsp; great. This GPU is great. It is working great.

- [00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uV3oqdILOmA&t=483) All right, this is RTX 3090 Ti. This&nbsp; is the noise that it is making. You see

- [00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uV3oqdILOmA&t=491) even though it is outside of the case,&nbsp; it is still pretty loud because of the

- [00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uV3oqdILOmA&t=496) temperatures. But this is probably the&nbsp; cheapest RTX 3090 Ti that you can get.

- [00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uV3oqdILOmA&t=505) And here, as you can see, it has&nbsp; been running over 11 minutes.

- [00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uV3oqdILOmA&t=510) Its temperature is around 79 Celsius and the&nbsp; fan speed is 60% as you are seeing. Finally,

- [00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uV3oqdILOmA&t=520) hopefully I will be doing a lot&nbsp; of more tests on AI applications,

- [00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uV3oqdILOmA&t=525) on other games and other benchmarks. So keep&nbsp; watching, stay subscribed. I will add all of

- [00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uV3oqdILOmA&t=531) the videos into a new playlist. I will link the&nbsp; playlist in the description of the video. So

- [00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uV3oqdILOmA&t=537) you will be able to watch all of the benchmarks,&nbsp; experiments and tests I make with the RTX 5090.
