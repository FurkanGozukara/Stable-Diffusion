### Video Transcription


- [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbn93GRQKsQ&t=0) Greetings everyone. Today I am going to&nbsp; introduce you a new Wan 2.1 model which is&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbn93GRQKsQ&t=5) called as FusionX. This model has become&nbsp; extremely popular recently. In addition,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbn93GRQKsQ&t=11) it also has LoRAs, so you can use it with your&nbsp; base model. I have made a lot of experimentation&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbn93GRQKsQ&t=17) to find out the very best parameters for&nbsp; this new model and prepare one-click to use&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbn93GRQKsQ&t=24) and one-click to download presets for you. With&nbsp; the model downloader application that we have,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbn93GRQKsQ&t=30) you will be able to download this model, import&nbsp; presets into the SwarmUI and directly use this&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbn93GRQKsQ&t=37) model with the highest quality. This model only&nbsp; requires 8 steps to generate videos from text&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbn93GRQKsQ&t=45) or images and its quality is just mind-blowingly&nbsp; amazing. Additionally, I have prepared presets for&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbn93GRQKsQ&t=52) FLUX Dev model as well because this was getting&nbsp; asked of me. There is official FLUX Dev model&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbn93GRQKsQ&t=58) preset and there is 2x latent upscale preset. With&nbsp; our model downloader, you will be able to download&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbn93GRQKsQ&t=67) the face restoration plus upscaler models, then&nbsp; with applying the preset that I have developed,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbn93GRQKsQ&t=74) you will be able to generate amazing quality&nbsp; images. The 2x upscale will add huge realism,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbn93GRQKsQ&t=81) quality, details to your generations as you&nbsp; are seeing right now. Just look at these newly&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbn93GRQKsQ&t=87) generated details in the image. It is just&nbsp; mind-blowingly amazing and it is super real.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbn93GRQKsQ&t=93) So if you were having issues to generate&nbsp; realistic images with FLUX and if you are&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbn93GRQKsQ&t=98) struggling to upscale it properly, this&nbsp; is the tutorial that you were looking for.

- [00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbn93GRQKsQ&t=102) We are going to use SwarmUI and ComfyUI as a&nbsp; backend, and if you don't know how to install&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbn93GRQKsQ&t=108) them, I already have an amazing tutorial here,&nbsp; so you can watch this. The link will be also&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbn93GRQKsQ&t=114) in the description of the video. So, this is the&nbsp; main link that you are going to use. You see the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbn93GRQKsQ&t=118) tutorial is also linked here. The link will be&nbsp; in the description of the video. First of all,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbn93GRQKsQ&t=123) download the latest SwarmUI model downloader&nbsp; zip file. Move it into your SwarmUI installation&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbn93GRQKsQ&t=130) like this, then right click and extract all. I&nbsp; will extract like this, then move and overwrite&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbn93GRQKsQ&t=137) all of the files in the main folder like this,&nbsp; replace. Then double click Windows start download&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbn93GRQKsQ&t=143) models up.bat file, more info, run anyway. Pay&nbsp; attention to the version you are seeing here.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbn93GRQKsQ&t=149) It should be at least version 46. Always use the&nbsp; latest version. Click download bundles and you can&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbn93GRQKsQ&t=156) download the FusionX FP16 bundle or FusionX FP8&nbsp; bundle. Either of them is fine. When you click&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbn93GRQKsQ&t=164) the download bundle, it will download all of&nbsp; the necessary models. But if you don't want to&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbn93GRQKsQ&t=169) download new big models, what you can do, scroll&nbsp; down and you will see there are LoRA models. Click&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbn93GRQKsQ&t=175) there, click various LoRAs, and you will see&nbsp; that there is Wan 2.1 14 billion FusionX LoRA&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbn93GRQKsQ&t=181) for image-to-video and text-to-video. You can&nbsp; click each one of them and all of the downloads&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbn93GRQKsQ&t=186) will start with the maximum speed. You will see&nbsp; the queue here. Currently we have queue of 3. You&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbn93GRQKsQ&t=192) can also watch the progress here. It will use your&nbsp; entire bandwidth to download. This downloader is&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbn93GRQKsQ&t=199) extremely optimized and it uses the latest Hugging&nbsp; Face libraries, and I am downloading from Hugging&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbn93GRQKsQ&t=205) Face so they are super fast. Moreover, if you&nbsp; have previously downloaded, it will just skip&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbn93GRQKsQ&t=210) that file. And if your download fails for any&nbsp; reason, it will try to resume the download.

- [00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbn93GRQKsQ&t=215) Alright, so all of the models have been&nbsp; downloaded. We can see from the logs and from the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbn93GRQKsQ&t=221) CMD window. So, as a next step, what we need to do&nbsp; is just return back to your installation and use&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbn93GRQKsQ&t=228) Windows update swarmui.bat file. This will update&nbsp; the SwarmUI to the latest version and start it.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbn93GRQKsQ&t=235) You see, automatically updated and now starting,&nbsp; and it is started. So, how we are going to use&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbn93GRQKsQ&t=241) these new models? To use them, first of all,&nbsp; we should have the presets imported. To import&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbn93GRQKsQ&t=248) presets, you can delete your existing presets&nbsp; because I changed some of their names, but if you&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbn93GRQKsQ&t=254) want to keep all of them, click Import Presets,&nbsp; click Choose File, return back to the installation&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbn93GRQKsQ&t=259) folder and select amazing swarmui presets version&nbsp; 1. Check this overwrite existing presets and&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbn93GRQKsQ&t=265) import. And it will import all of these best&nbsp; configuration presets. Then let's generate an&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbn93GRQKsQ&t=272) example video. So first of all, I will click Quick&nbsp; Tools, Reset Params to Default so that I will&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbn93GRQKsQ&t=277) have the default parameters. Then, which model we&nbsp; should use? Select Wan 2.1 FusionX Image to Video,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbn93GRQKsQ&t=285) direct apply, and it will apply all of the&nbsp; settings. Now you see that it is selecting init&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbn93GRQKsQ&t=290) image because the bug has been fixed and it has&nbsp; the init image creativity as zero. So click choose&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbn93GRQKsQ&t=296) file, choose the image that you want to animate&nbsp; like this, then select the model from here. Why?&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbn93GRQKsQ&t=303) Because there is one important thing. To find the&nbsp; model, let's type image or let's type FusionX, it&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbn93GRQKsQ&t=310) is easier. And select the FusionX Image to Video&nbsp; and click Res closest aspect ratio. You see the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbn93GRQKsQ&t=317) resolution is selected like this. This is wrong&nbsp; because this model has 960 resolution. So click&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbn93GRQKsQ&t=324) this hamburger menu, Edit Metadata, set it as 960,&nbsp; 960. But you can keep it as 640 if you want to&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbn93GRQKsQ&t=332) generate at lower resolution. However, this is the&nbsp; native resolution, so change models and it will&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbn93GRQKsQ&t=337) get fixed like this. Okay, we are ready. What else&nbsp; you can change? You can make the steps count 10,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbn93GRQKsQ&t=343) it works better with 10 but 8 is also sufficient.&nbsp; You can go to image to video settings and make&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbn93GRQKsQ&t=349) sure that you have changed the model from here.&nbsp; This is not saved in the preset for some reason&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbn93GRQKsQ&t=355) or this may not be. So select this FusionX image&nbsp; to video and you need to set your frame count.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbn93GRQKsQ&t=362) So 16 frames is 1 second. So let's generate&nbsp; 49 frames, it is 3 seconds. But there is plus&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbn93GRQKsQ&t=369) one as you are seeing. And I can also apply RIFE&nbsp; frame interpolation to increase FPS to 32. Okay,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbn93GRQKsQ&t=376) that's it. I also need to type a prompt for&nbsp; animating this image. For this task, I have used&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbn93GRQKsQ&t=383) O3 model. I just said write a single line detailed&nbsp; prompt. Okay, this is the prompt it written. Copy&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbn93GRQKsQ&t=389) paste it, but you can also write your own prompt.&nbsp; And let's generate. I have RTX 5090, so let's&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbn93GRQKsQ&t=395) monitor what's happening. nvitop. I have to be&nbsp; sure that it is using almost entire GPU watt,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbn93GRQKsQ&t=403) otherwise that means that it is using shared VRAM&nbsp; and if it uses shared VRAM, it will be extremely&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbn93GRQKsQ&t=409) slow. So I need to be sure that it is properly&nbsp; doing block swapping and it is using almost entire&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbn93GRQKsQ&t=416) GPU. So far it is looking good, 460 watts. Okay,&nbsp; 100, this is bad. Let's see what happens. Okay,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbn93GRQKsQ&t=423) 150 watts. So currently there is a bug somewhere&nbsp; because maybe I am using a lot of other stuff with&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbn93GRQKsQ&t=429) the VRAM. So how can I fix this? I can restart&nbsp; and try again, but let's just wait a little&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbn93GRQKsQ&t=435) bit more to be sure. We can also see from task&nbsp; manager and shared VRAM usage is 500 megabytes.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbn93GRQKsQ&t=442) Okay, it is getting better, 300 watts, 320 watts.&nbsp; I am also recording a video, therefore it is also&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbn93GRQKsQ&t=449) using some VRAM. So what can I do? It is still&nbsp; slow. I can go to server backends and I can&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbn93GRQKsQ&t=455) change the reserve VRAM like 5 gigabytes. Okay,&nbsp; save. It will cancel the task. I need to wait for&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbn93GRQKsQ&t=462) backends to be reloaded. This normally shouldn't&nbsp; happen you if you just restart your computer,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbn93GRQKsQ&t=468) do not run anything else, just run the SwarmUI.&nbsp; This shouldn't happen you. But if it happens like&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbn93GRQKsQ&t=473) me because of some other applications, you need to&nbsp; do same, just click generate again and we got an&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbn93GRQKsQ&t=479) error because we just restarted, it is fine. Let's&nbsp; see the watt usage. Okay, it is again definitely&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbn93GRQKsQ&t=485) using shared VRAM. This is a bug in ComfyUI. I&nbsp; couldn't find the reason yet. If I restart my PC,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbn93GRQKsQ&t=493) it would get fixed, but I don't want to set&nbsp; up everything from again. So I will just wait&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbn93GRQKsQ&t=498) for video to be generated, then I will move&nbsp; to the next step of showing you tutorial,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbn93GRQKsQ&t=503) but you understand the logic. If this happens,&nbsp; that means that you should restart your computer,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbn93GRQKsQ&t=508) do not open another application, and you&nbsp; should try to get as many as watt usages.

- [00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbn93GRQKsQ&t=515) Okay guys, I have solved the problem of using&nbsp; shared VRAM. I have reinstalled my ComfyUI&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbn93GRQKsQ&t=521) backend and I discovered that with image-to-video&nbsp; models currently, Sage Attention is broken. I have&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbn93GRQKsQ&t=530) reported this error. It works with text-to-video&nbsp; and also text-to-image models. However,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbn93GRQKsQ&t=536) with image-to-video, it is broken currently. This&nbsp; is because of ComfyUI latest version probably,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbn93GRQKsQ&t=544) but now it is properly generating the video.&nbsp; It is using accurate amount of VRAM. The speed&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbn93GRQKsQ&t=551) is very decent. Let me demonstrate you while I&nbsp; am recording a video. So the speed is around 20&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbn93GRQKsQ&t=557) second/it. It is for HD resolution.&nbsp; The resolution is 960 to 960. Okay,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbn93GRQKsQ&t=565) I have forgotten it, so I need to reset. Then&nbsp; the frame count is 49. So with these settings,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbn93GRQKsQ&t=571) this is the speed we are getting. Okay, this is&nbsp; 960 to 960 video. Now I am generating another&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbn93GRQKsQ&t=579) one with accurate aspect ratio after I&nbsp; did set. So we will see it in a moment.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbn93GRQKsQ&t=584) Let's also see the speed. Yes, the speed&nbsp; is around same, 20 second/it right now on&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbn93GRQKsQ&t=590) RTX 5090 while I am recording a video&nbsp; and this is the VRAM usage currently.

- [00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbn93GRQKsQ&t=596) Okay, so the video has been generated.&nbsp; It only took 3 minutes and let's see the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbn93GRQKsQ&t=602) quality. The quality is just amazing,&nbsp; the mind-blowing. You see the realism,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbn93GRQKsQ&t=607) you see the high definition. This is&nbsp; HD resolution and this is the initial&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbn93GRQKsQ&t=613) image we have used. It already has some&nbsp; mistakes, anatomically and from other parts,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbn93GRQKsQ&t=619) but the quality of the generated video is just&nbsp; mind-blowingly amazing with only 8 steps and&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbn93GRQKsQ&t=626) it only took 3 minutes. I also applied RIFE 2x&nbsp; frame interpolation, so it is also looking very,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbn93GRQKsQ&t=634) very high FPS. So how do we use text-to-video&nbsp; model? To use the text-to-video model,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbn93GRQKsQ&t=640) click Quick Tools, Reset Params to Default,&nbsp; then just use Wan 2.1 FusionX Text to Video,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbn93GRQKsQ&t=647) direct apply. Then I will just type it and I don't&nbsp; need to type anything else, but if you want to&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbn93GRQKsQ&t=653) set RIFE frame interpolation, you need to go to&nbsp; the text-to-video and enable it from here. You&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbn93GRQKsQ&t=660) can also change the number of frames from here and&nbsp; let's see the difference. By the way, we also need&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbn93GRQKsQ&t=666) to select the model, so interrupt and let's change&nbsp; it to text-to-video model from here and generate&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbn93GRQKsQ&t=673) and that's it. It will load text-to-video model&nbsp; right now, then it will start the generation.

- [00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbn93GRQKsQ&t=678) Okay, text-to-video generation started. The&nbsp; speed is looking almost same, decent speed,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbn93GRQKsQ&t=684) like 20 second/it. By the way, I am using&nbsp; FP16 version of the model. Therefore,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbn93GRQKsQ&t=691) it requires some significant amount of&nbsp; block swapping. It is not fitting into&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbn93GRQKsQ&t=696) the VRAM. You can also use FP8 version if you&nbsp; don't have a powerful GPU and a lot of RAM,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbn93GRQKsQ&t=703) but this may yield better&nbsp; quality compared to FP8 version.

- [00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbn93GRQKsQ&t=709) Okay, so text-to-video is also has been completed.&nbsp; This is text-to-video generation. It is pretty&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbn93GRQKsQ&t=715) good, pretty decent, but image-to-video yields&nbsp; better results if you ask my opinion. You can&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbn93GRQKsQ&t=722) control more, but it is working. How about&nbsp; if we want to use LoRA? It is exactly same.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbn93GRQKsQ&t=728) Instead of this model, you need to select base Wan&nbsp; 2.1 model. You can use GGUF or other variants as&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbn93GRQKsQ&t=736) in the other videos. For example, you can select&nbsp; Wan 2.1 text-to-video GGUF and from the LoRAs,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbn93GRQKsQ&t=743) all you need to do is just select Wan 2.1&nbsp; text-to-video FusionX LoRA and you can change&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbn93GRQKsQ&t=749) its strength, its scale, its power from here.&nbsp; Let's try as a default. Let's also try with the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbn93GRQKsQ&t=756) same seed and see if there will be significant&nbsp; difference or not. Okay, let's generate.

- [00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbn93GRQKsQ&t=763) Okay, we got the output with LoRA as well and the&nbsp; results are astonishingly similar. You see, this&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbn93GRQKsQ&t=772) is with LoRA, almost same and this is the base&nbsp; model. I think both of them is looking amazing.

- [00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbn93GRQKsQ&t=779) Okay, now as a next step, I'm going to show you&nbsp; how to use FLUX presets and also how to upscale.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbn93GRQKsQ&t=787) So open back our Windows start download models&nbsp; up.bat file. You can download the FLUX bundle&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbn93GRQKsQ&t=793) from here. You see FLUX models bundle. Download&nbsp; it if you are lacking that and additionally,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbn93GRQKsQ&t=800) what you should download is, you will see that&nbsp; there is other models, image upscaling models.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbn93GRQKsQ&t=806) This is what I recommend. So click the download&nbsp; best upscaler models. These are image upscaling&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbn93GRQKsQ&t=813) models. Moreover, download face segment&nbsp; masking models. These two are the extra&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbn93GRQKsQ&t=819) models to the FLUX additionally that you need to&nbsp; download. Since I already have downloaded them,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbn93GRQKsQ&t=824) they are automatically downloaded. So&nbsp; Quick Tools, Reset Params to Default,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbn93GRQKsQ&t=828) then go to the models and let's select FLUX. So&nbsp; I have this model that I have trained myself and&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbn93GRQKsQ&t=835) go to the presets and you see FLUX Dev Official&nbsp; preset. So, direct apply and all the parameters&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbn93GRQKsQ&t=842) are set. So I'm going to use this prompt on&nbsp; the model that I have trained myself and I&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbn93GRQKsQ&t=849) will generate an image. This will generate default&nbsp; 1024 to 1024. The FLUX generation on RTX 5090 is&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbn93GRQKsQ&t=859) already really fast. So without even using the&nbsp; Sage Attention, let's see the speed. Okay, it&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbn93GRQKsQ&t=865) is 2 it/s, almost 1.8 it/s and I am using 16-bit&nbsp; precision, not even 8-bit precision, and it is&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbn93GRQKsQ&t=876) getting generated very quickly. It is also going&nbsp; to do a face inpainting which doubles the time&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbn93GRQKsQ&t=883) that it takes. Okay, this is weird why it shows&nbsp; like this, but let's see. Interesting, we got an&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbn93GRQKsQ&t=890) error with the face inpainting for a reason.&nbsp; Now I am generating without face inpainting,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbn93GRQKsQ&t=896) segmentation, face inpainting. Oh, by the way,&nbsp; we can modify this prompt and use the default&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbn93GRQKsQ&t=902) model of the SwarmUI. So let's try it. Segment,&nbsp; then it will ask us face, then we can just type&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbn93GRQKsQ&t=910) our prompt like photograph of ohwx man and let's&nbsp; use the same seed. Okay, this is generated. This&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbn93GRQKsQ&t=918) image doesn't require face inpainting, but let&nbsp; me show you. I'm just going to show you. Okay,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbn93GRQKsQ&t=923) it is going to generate. The automatic&nbsp; segmentation is determined from here. You see,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbn93GRQKsQ&t=929) segment refining, you can decide the order. You&nbsp; can change the other parameters like segment blur,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbn93GRQKsQ&t=936) grow, oversize, threshold. Okay, after this,&nbsp; it should automatically segment. I think it&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbn93GRQKsQ&t=941) is using CLIP model for segmentation. Let's see&nbsp; from the server logs what is happening. Yeah,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbn93GRQKsQ&t=947) it didn't show. Okay, it shows now. Yes. Now&nbsp; it is accurately processing the segment. Yeah,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbn93GRQKsQ&t=954) it is working. Let's compare images from this&nbsp; to this. Yes, I can see that the face looking&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbn93GRQKsQ&t=961) better right now. Yes. So how we are going&nbsp; to upscale? Go to presets and this time we&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbn93GRQKsQ&t=965) are going to apply FLUX Dev Official 2x Latent&nbsp; Upscaler, direct apply. What it is going to do is,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbn93GRQKsQ&t=973) it is just going to enable refine upscale and set&nbsp; these settings. This is the model that I prefer.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbn93GRQKsQ&t=979) And then let's hit generate. This will increase&nbsp; the time by four times because it is upscaling.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbn93GRQKsQ&t=986) And also when you upscale, you usually don't&nbsp; need face inpainting. But let's see the result.

- [00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbn93GRQKsQ&t=992) And the upscale has been completed. Let's see&nbsp; the difference from this image to this image.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbn93GRQKsQ&t=998) It has a huge, huge amount of quality difference&nbsp; as you are seeing right now. It is looking way,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbn93GRQKsQ&t=1004) way better as you can see. Before ending this&nbsp; tutorial, I have one more thing to show you.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbn93GRQKsQ&t=1010) I'm working on ultimate video processing&nbsp; application. Let me demonstrate you how&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbn93GRQKsQ&t=1015) far it has come and soon hopefully it&nbsp; will be published. Before publishing,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbn93GRQKsQ&t=1021) I'm going to raise the Bronze, Premium prices,&nbsp; so you can subscribe right now. We have made&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbn93GRQKsQ&t=1026) so much changes. We have added so many new&nbsp; features. One of the new features we added is&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbn93GRQKsQ&t=1033) image-based upscalers which are extremely fast.&nbsp; Hopefully see you in another tutorial video.
