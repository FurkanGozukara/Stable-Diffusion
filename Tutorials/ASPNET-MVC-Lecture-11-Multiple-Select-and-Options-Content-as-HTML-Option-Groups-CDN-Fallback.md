- [00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=3) hello dear students welcome to the lecture 11 of responsive web design with

- [00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=5) lecture 11 of responsive web design with asp.net 5 and mvc python and bootstrap

- [00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8) asp.net 5 and mvc python and bootstrap 5.

- [00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=9) 5. so today we will continue from where we

- [00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=11) so today we will continue from where we have left at the previous week the text

- [00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=14) have left at the previous week the text ali attack helper i will start with

- [00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=16) ali attack helper i will start with cloning our repository

- [00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=19) cloning our repository our previous lecture directory

- [00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=58) okay so let's read from here until it's getting loaded

- [00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=66) the text area tag helper for general text input the html

- [00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=69) for general text input the html specification offers two types of

- [00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=71) specification offers two types of elements

- [00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=72) elements the input element which handles all

- [00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=74) the input element which handles all kinds of input from the generic text

- [00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=76) kinds of input from the generic text type to the more exotic radio and check

- [00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=78) type to the more exotic radio and check buttons

- [00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=79) buttons and while the text input is great for

- [00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=81) and while the text input is great for short single line text input

- [00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=83) short single line text input it's not built for longer texts for this

- [00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=86) it's not built for longer texts for this purpose we have the text area

- [00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=88) purpose we have the text area element it generally looks like a normal

- [00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=91) element it generally looks like a normal text input element

- [00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=92) text input element but it can span multiple lines by

- [00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=94) but it can span multiple lines by default and comes with support for

- [00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=96) default and comes with support for scroll bars in other words

- [00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=97) scroll bars in other words it's built for longer texts asp.net core

- [00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=101) it's built for longer texts asp.net core comes with a nice tag helper for the

- [00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=103) comes with a nice tag helper for the text area

- [00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=104) text area just like for the input element so let's

- [00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=106) just like for the input element so let's look into it

- [00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=107) look into it okay so with text area we can take

- [00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=109) okay so with text area we can take multi-line input from

- [00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=112) multi-line input from user and it would be obviously

- [00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=116) user and it would be obviously better

- [00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=121) okay let's start with renaming our lectures

- [00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=143) okay and let's rename our solution as well

- [00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=152) okay and [Music]

- [00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=154) [Music] let's start with lecture 11

- [00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=157) let's start with lecture 11 [Music]

- [00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=159) [Music] actually we don't even need lecture 11

- [00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=161) actually we don't even need lecture 11 right now

- [00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=162) right now we can continue from lecture 10

- [00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=165) we can continue from lecture 10 you see we already have text area for

- [00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=168) you see we already have text area for big leather and

- [00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=170) big leather and in our model

- [00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=173) in our model here we have big leather as multiline

- [00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=176) here we have big leather as multiline text data type and

- [00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=179) text data type and at the code behind in our controller

- [00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=184) at the code behind in our controller we can see how the data we are getting

- [00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=196) okay let's continue i will test it in a moment

- [00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=198) moment the for property just like several of

- [00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=202) the for property just like several of the other tag helpers

- [00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=203) the other tag helpers the connection to the model is created

- [00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=205) the connection to the model is created with the for property

- [00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=206) with the for property and as with any other tag helper

- [00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=208) and as with any other tag helper property it requires a prefix

- [00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=211) property it requires a prefix this prefix is usually asp unless you

- [00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=214) this prefix is usually asp unless you specifically change this

- [00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=216) specifically change this in other words a tag helper enable text

- [00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=219) in other words a tag helper enable text area in its most simple form

- [00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=221) area in its most simple form would look like this text area asp for

- [00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=224) would look like this text area asp for equals description text area description

- [00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=228) equals description text area description is the

- [00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=228) is the code behind a parameter name it will be

- [00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=231) code behind a parameter name it will be string

- [00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=232) string this will give you a very basic text

- [00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=234) this will give you a very basic text area the resulting html looks like this

- [00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=238) area the resulting html looks like this okay since no size or anything else is

- [00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=242) okay since no size or anything else is specified

- [00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=243) specified the rendered size will be decided by the

- [00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=245) the rendered size will be decided by the browser

- [00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=246) browser if you want more control over this and

- [00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=248) if you want more control over this and you probably do

- [00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=249) you probably do you will need to use the relevant html

- [00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=252) you will need to use the relevant html properties either the old school calls

- [00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=254) properties either the old school calls and rows or through the style property

- [00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=256) and rows or through the style property using css

- [00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=258) using css here's an example of each notice how

- [00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=260) here's an example of each notice how easy it is to mix the tag helper

- [00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=261) easy it is to mix the tag helper attribute

- [00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=262) attribute for with regular html attributes okay

- [00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=265) for with regular html attributes okay let's

- [00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=266) let's test it immediately in our application

- [00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=269) test it immediately in our application so i will bind it to let me

- [00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=273) so i will bind it to let me find our model here just a regular

- [00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=276) find our model here just a regular string prop string

- [00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=280) string prop string okay let's say as our description

- [00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=289) okay and then let's

- [00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=295) get a new line like this and then

- [00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=308) okay so you see intellisense telling me that there is no

- [00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=309) that there is no description at the model which is bound

- [00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=312) description at the model which is bound to this

- [00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=314) to this cs html page so i will just type sr and

- [00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=318) cs html page so i will just type sr and sr description has the right

- [00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=321) sr description has the right okay now when we run the application it

- [00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=324) okay now when we run the application it should be

- [00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=325) should be rendered as expected

- [00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=333) okay meanwhile reading it let's continue there are of course many more styling

- [00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=335) there are of course many more styling options using css

- [00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=336) options using css but that's a subject for another

- [00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=338) but that's a subject for another tutorial okay we can

- [00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=340) tutorial okay we can pass that for now controlling minimum

- [00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=343) pass that for now controlling minimum and maximum lengths

- [00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=346) and maximum lengths both the input and the text area html

- [00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=349) both the input and the text area html elements allows you to specify a max

- [00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=351) elements allows you to specify a max length attribute

- [00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=352) length attribute to control the maximum amount of

- [00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=354) to control the maximum amount of characters allowed in the element

- [00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=356) characters allowed in the element however when using tag helpers there's

- [00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=358) however when using tag helpers there's no need to specify this in the markup

- [00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=360) no need to specify this in the markup instead

- [00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=361) instead define it directly on the model so we

- [00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=363) define it directly on the model so we don't need to define max length

- [00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=366) don't need to define max length in our html code we can define it in

- [00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=369) in our html code we can define it in our model since we are binding that

- [00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=372) our model since we are binding that element to a

- [00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=374) element to a property in our model

- [00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=377) property in our model this will allow you to only define it in

- [00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=379) this will allow you to only define it in one place to be used anywhere you use

- [00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=381) one place to be used anywhere you use this property

- [00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=382) this property including validation before saving to a

- [00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=385) including validation before saving to a database etc

- [00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=386) database etc so this approach is much better because

- [00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=388) so this approach is much better because it will be globally available everywhere

- [00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=391) it will be globally available everywhere where you are binding to this model and

- [00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=394) where you are binding to this model and it will be automatically verified at the

- [00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=396) it will be automatically verified at the code behind

- [00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=401) here's an example of a movie class where we define a max length for the

- [00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=402) we define a max length for the description property

- [00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=404) description property okay so here our

- [00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=408) okay so here our multi-line boxes you see i can change

- [00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=412) multi-line boxes you see i can change their properties

- [00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=413) their properties and when i refresh this is the default

- [00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=416) and when i refresh this is the default uh this is the size that we have defined

- [00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=419) uh this is the size that we have defined for example here we have defined as 25

- [00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=422) for example here we have defined as 25 coulombs and

- [00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=424) coulombs and three rows you see it is three rows and

- [00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=427) three rows you see it is three rows and i think we can type 25

- [00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=429) i think we can type 25 and in here it is 200 400 pixel

- [00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=433) and in here it is 200 400 pixel so it is not a raw based you see there

- [00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=436) so it is not a raw based you see there is still some

- [00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=438) is still some space at the bottom and

- [00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=442) space at the bottom and yeah that's it i can change its size as

- [00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=445) yeah that's it i can change its size as i want like this

- [00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=447) i want like this let's also add max length and mean

- [00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=450) let's also add max length and mean length

- [00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=460) okay max length equal to 32 okay

- [00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=486) okay by the way this will be verified if we put this inside a

- [00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=488) we put this inside a form before we can even able to submit

- [00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=492) form before we can even able to submit it let's also make that way to test

- [00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=501) okay so i'm going to generate a post like this and

- [00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=506) like this and here and let's add a

- [00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=511) here and let's add a stop it button

- [00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=518) okay let's run so when i click this submit button it

- [00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=521) so when i click this submit button it will

- [00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=522) will uh tell me that you have to enter

- [00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=525) uh tell me that you have to enter certain number of uh strings letters

- [00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=529) certain number of uh strings letters into the boxes before even even like

- [00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=532) into the boxes before even even like uh before even i can even

- [00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=536) uh before even i can even submit it back to the server okay

- [00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=546) okay when i click oh it will submit interesting

- [00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=549) interesting why

- [00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=556) okay it has max length and mini length us maybe because we have

- [00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=559) and mini length us maybe because we have a lot

- [00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=560) a lot more and

- [00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=567) yeah now it says invalid data sent back to the server

- [00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=569) to the server however it is not preventing us from

- [00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=573) however it is not preventing us from submitting so

- [00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=576) submitting so let's check what we are missing

- [00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=591) okay this was supposed to be not submittable

- [00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=614) yeah it is not working let's try it on time explorers

- [00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=617) time explorers maybe there will be a difference

- [00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=625) no you see since it is not validating model we are

- [00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=626) model we are getting this but our submission is

- [00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=630) getting this but our submission is not prevented so

- [00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=647) oh we didn't add client side validation yet

- [00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=649) yet notice how the max length attributes are

- [00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=651) notice how the max length attributes are added to the markup

- [00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=652) added to the markup but on top of that data attributes are

- [00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=654) but on top of that data attributes are generated to support client-side model

- [00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=656) generated to support client-side model validation

- [00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=658) validation validation if you test this simple form

- [00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=661) validation if you test this simple form in a browser

- [00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=662) in a browser you will see that it's no longer

- [00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=664) you will see that it's no longer possible to input any more characters

- [00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=666) possible to input any more characters than what the max length attribute

- [00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=667) than what the max length attribute specified

- [00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=675) okay and did we add client-side validation

- [00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=678) did we add client-side validation scripts

- [00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=679) scripts they were we have used that in

- [00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=682) they were we have used that in lectures nine i think

- [00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=688) lectures nine i think okay yeah this secrets i'm going to

- [00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=691) okay yeah this secrets i'm going to put these scripts into our viv import

- [00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=694) put these scripts into our viv import so they will be available in every page

- [00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=698) so they will be available in every page right now so i can

- [00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=699) right now so i can then remove them from here and let's

- [00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=702) then remove them from here and let's restart and see what happens

- [00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=717) restart and see what happens okay now it is supposed to generate a

- [00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=721) okay now it is supposed to generate a client-side java scripts

- [00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=722) client-side java scripts to client-side verify as well

- [00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=732) okay and like this okay it's sitting down verify client side

- [00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=742) but our secret should be available when i give the page source do i see it

- [00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=770) [Music] um

- [00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=773) um okay

- [00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=784) not visible in page source code let's see why

- [00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=815) let's check the network source code okay so we have localhost and in our

- [00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=817) okay so we have localhost and in our response

- [00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=829) let's add a test here like this it should be put into the top of the

- [00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=832) it should be put into the top of the page

- [00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=834) page it is under the weave so it should be

- [00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=836) it is under the weave so it should be available for

- [00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=838) available for all pages we

- [00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=842) all pages we import

- [00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=856) oh it is not available right now you don't see the test anywhere

- [00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=925) another mystery to solve for us talk helpers are visible but weaving

- [00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=928) talk helpers are visible but weaving but scripts are not

- [00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=931) but scripts are not and we can't even see that

- [00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=935) and we can't even see that in our source code

- [00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1018) okay so the big import cs h7 supports uh i see for java secret i think we need to

- [00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1021) i see for java secret i think we need to use what was its name

- [00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1026) use what was its name it was something else but i can't

- [00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1027) it was something else but i can't remember right now

- [00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1036) leave start yes we need to use viewstat not with imports for csh

- [00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1038) not with imports for csh for java secrets

- [00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1058) what was the difference if starts with purchase

- [00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1059) purchase we import let's refresh our memory

- [00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1081) okay okay let's read the answer from here

- [00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1087) the underscore view start file it is used to set up shared memory

- [00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1089) it is used to set up shared memory public static variables

- [00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1091) public static variables across all view for example

- [00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1094) across all view for example the common practice for view start is to

- [00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1096) the common practice for view start is to set up a default value that you can

- [00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1098) set up a default value that you can override for the layout and the view

- [00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1100) override for the layout and the view data slash view bag dictionary

- [00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1103) data slash view bag dictionary the underscore view imports file

- [00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1106) the underscore view imports file in this file you can summarize abstract

- [00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1109) in this file you can summarize abstract all using statements that you commonly

- [00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1111) all using statements that you commonly use in all your views

- [00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1113) use in all your views why to use underscore view imports file

- [00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1115) why to use underscore view imports file for common using directives instead of

- [00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1117) for common using directives instead of view start

- [00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1119) view start because using directives has the scope

- [00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1121) because using directives has the scope of the body of the current view file

- [00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1124) of the body of the current view file so putting it using statements inside

- [00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1126) so putting it using statements inside viewstart file won't make them available

- [00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1128) viewstart file won't make them available for any other view file except the body

- [00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1130) for any other view file except the body of the view start file itself

- [00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1132) of the view start file itself okay so that is why we didn't see them

- [00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1134) okay so that is why we didn't see them we've import renders

- [00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1136) we've import renders inside the body therefore

- [00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1140) inside the body therefore these scripts are not visible dash

- [00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1143) these scripts are not visible dash let's add a view start file

- [00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1147) let's add a view start file this simply have here and it is exactly

- [00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1152) this simply have here and it is exactly name it as we

- [00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1153) name it as we start

- [00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1159) like this view start okay and i think this is

- [00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1163) okay and i think this is rendered at the top of the page or end

- [00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1169) of the page let's continue

- [00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1180) itself therefore comes the special view imports file which is designed to serve

- [00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1182) imports file which is designed to serve this scope extension purpose of the

- [00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1184) this scope extension purpose of the using statements and other useful things

- [00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1186) using statements and other useful things such as the tag helper which without

- [00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1188) such as the tag helper which without this special file

- [00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1189) this special file would be repeated inside each view file

- [00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1191) would be repeated inside each view file which violates the drive

- [00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1193) which violates the drive don't repeat

- [00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1206) one code that needs to be executed before each page should be placed

- [00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1207) before each page should be placed underscore viewstart.cshtml file

- [00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1210) underscore viewstart.cshtml file okay code that needs to be executed

- [00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1213) okay code that needs to be executed before each page which means our header

- [00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1215) before each page which means our header file

- [00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1216) file now we should be able to see them yes

- [00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1219) now we should be able to see them yes you see

- [00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1220) you see now we are seeing our secrets in our

- [00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1223) now we are seeing our secrets in our header and

- [00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1224) header and now when we try yes it is not working

- [00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1227) now when we try yes it is not working however we are not seeing the messages

- [00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1229) however we are not seeing the messages because we didn't

- [00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1232) because we didn't at a validation address some

- [00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1236) at a validation address some summary and let's add that as well

- [00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1240) summary and let's add that as well i think it will be labeled asp for

- [00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1243) i think it will be labeled asp for error family

- [00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1247) error family okay okay yes we don't need and we see

- [00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1250) okay okay yes we don't need and we see error summary

- [00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1255) i think there was something here validation summary attribute and

- [00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1263) html validation summary i wonder if there is such attack

- [00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1276) okay sp or

- [00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1296) let's use html5 html validation summary validation

- [00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1304) summary okay and let's see the validation

- [00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1307) okay and let's see the validation summary tag helpers

- [00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1309) summary tag helpers and how it is made

- [00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1315) okay html validation summary here we have that we know that

- [00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1318) have that we know that oh it is like this asp validation

- [00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1320) oh it is like this asp validation summary

- [00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1322) summary yeah nice let's make it like this nice

- [00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1325) yeah nice let's make it like this nice you see now it is

- [00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1327) you see now it is uh summary model only

- [00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1336) and what other options there are i think there is also all

- [00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1337) there is also all or something like that yeah okay now we

- [00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1340) or something like that yeah okay now we should be able to see

- [00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1341) should be able to see the errors for

- [00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1345) the errors for this particular form only for this

- [00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1347) this particular form only for this insight

- [00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1348) insight i think though i am not sure

- [00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1366) okay so let's inspect the source coach okay we have div class

- [00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1369) source coach okay we have div class validation summary

- [00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1371) validation summary data validation message summary true

- [00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1374) data validation message summary true and inside it it has some list

- [00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1379) and inside it it has some list and i think it should be bound to this

- [00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1382) and i think it should be bound to this let's try

- [00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1389) yes yes now it says that the field sr description must be a string or a data

- [00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1391) description must be a string or a data with minimum length of

- [00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1392) with minimum length of five okay so

- [00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1395) five okay so when we set them five it's it returns

- [00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1400) when we set them five it's it returns however when i set one of them three it

- [00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1403) however when i set one of them three it still bypasses

- [00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1406) still bypasses so if one of them satisfy

- [00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1409) so if one of them satisfy the requirements the other one is not

- [00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1412) the requirements the other one is not checked it

- [00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1414) checked it i see so this is expecting only one of

- [00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1417) i see so this is expecting only one of them to be

- [00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1418) them to be valid if i make it like this it will

- [00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1420) valid if i make it like this it will draw an error and won't

- [00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1422) draw an error and won't prospect to the server if i

- [00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1426) prospect to the server if i uh oh i cannot type more than 20 by the

- [00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1429) uh oh i cannot type more than 20 by the way

- [00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1434) all right data is received version 2. it is working and when we turn it is

- [00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1436) is working and when we turn it is returning like this

- [00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1442) so let's continue reading the difference where was it

- [00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1444) where was it here okay let's start from beginning

- [00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1448) here okay let's start from beginning code that needs to be executed before

- [00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1450) code that needs to be executed before each page should be placed

- [00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1452) each page should be placed underscore viewstart.cshtml file

- [00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1456) underscore viewstart.cshtml file for underscore view import.cshtml the

- [00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1459) for underscore view import.cshtml the contents of this file apply to all the

- [00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1461) contents of this file apply to all the files present in the same folder and

- [00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1463) files present in the same folder and subfolder

- [00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1466) subfolder so underscore view start is execution

- [00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1468) so underscore view start is execution whereas underscore view import applies

- [00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1470) whereas underscore view import applies its content to each file

- [00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1473) its content to each file test one placing both layout correct

- [00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1475) test one placing both layout correct reference and using statement

- [00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1477) reference and using statement incorrect and underscore view start will

- [00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1479) incorrect and underscore view start will give compiler error

- [00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1481) give compiler error test two placing both layout incorrect

- [00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1484) test two placing both layout incorrect reference and using statement

- [00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1486) reference and using statement correct and underscore view import will

- [00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1488) correct and underscore view import will not apply underscore layout to other

- [00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1490) not apply underscore layout to other pages

- [00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1492) pages as per msdn view import support

- [00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1494) as per msdn view import support following directives

- [00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1496) following directives add tag helper at remove tag helper all

- [00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1499) add tag helper at remove tag helper all run in order at tag helper prefix

- [00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1503) in order at tag helper prefix the closest one to the view overrides

- [00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1505) the closest one to the view overrides any others

- [00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1507) any others at model the closest one to the view

- [00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1509) at model the closest one to the view overrides any others

- [00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1511) overrides any others at inherits the closest one to the view

- [00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1514) at inherits the closest one to the view overrides any others

- [00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1516) overrides any others and use okay and

- [00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1523) okay code in we've started html file will only be

- [00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1524) will only be run for non-layout pages coding is

- [00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1528) run for non-layout pages coding is important will be run for both layout

- [00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1530) important will be run for both layout and learn the

- [00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1531) and learn the pages i have tested this by moving the

- [00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1534) pages i have tested this by moving the developer application in size javascript

- [00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1536) developer application in size javascript in a bit

- [00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1537) in a bit from imports file to the site file and

- [00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1539) from imports file to the site file and custom building error on my layout page

- [00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1541) custom building error on my layout page and it can now find

- [00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1543) and it can now find javascript and inject okay

- [00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1552) okay so these are the differences and let's see

- [00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1554) and let's see [Music]

- [00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1555) [Music] if you can find any other more useful

- [00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1559) if you can find any other more useful difference

- [00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1566) we've shared layouts and this thing is definitely okay

- [00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1598) okay what's the difference

- [00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1612) well this is important to understand

- [00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1614) this is important to understand underscore viewstart.cshtml

- [00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1618) underscore viewstart.cshtml it's a special file in asp.net core mvc

- [00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1622) it's a special file in asp.net core mvc the code in this file is executed before

- [00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1624) the code in this file is executed before the code in an individual view

- [00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1626) the code in an individual view is executed instead of setting the

- [00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1629) is executed instead of setting the layout property in each individual view

- [00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1631) layout property in each individual view we can move that code into the

- [00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1633) we can move that code into the underscore viewstart.cshtml file

- [00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1637) underscore viewstart.cshtml file by setting the layout property in

- [00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1638) by setting the layout property in underscore viewstart.cshtml file

- [00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1641) underscore viewstart.cshtml file maintaining our application becomes much

- [00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1643) maintaining our application becomes much easier

- [00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1645) easier in the future if we want to use a

- [00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1646) in the future if we want to use a different layout file we just need to

- [00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1648) different layout file we just need to change the code in one place in

- [00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1650) change the code in one place in underscore viewstart.cshtml

- [00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1653) underscore viewstart.cshtml okay let's start taking our lecture

- [00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1656) okay let's start taking our lecture notes for this week

- [00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1669) okay in lecture 11 okay

- [00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1672) 11 okay what is the difference

- [00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1675) what is the difference between by the way

- [00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1679) between by the way wherever you put these files it

- [00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1681) wherever you put these files it overrides all the subfolders

- [00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1683) overrides all the subfolders so since this is under waves it

- [00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1686) so since this is under waves it overrides all subfolders like

- [00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1688) overrides all subfolders like under lecture time or such if i move

- [00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1691) under lecture time or such if i move this on a lecture thumb folder it will only

- [00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1693) on a lecture thumb folder it will only be available for

- [00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1695) be available for lecture tenses html if i copy and

- [00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1698) lecture tenses html if i copy and colonity

- [00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1698) colonity under the lecture 10 then the clone will

- [00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1702) under the lecture 10 then the clone will overwrite the

- [00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1704) overwrite the parent one so it is it is working in

- [00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1708) parent one so it is it is working in hierarchy simply

- [00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1732) your secret files and define layout in

- [00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1736) define layout in restart okay so what happens

- [00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1740) restart okay so what happens if we move tag helpers to

- [00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1744) if we move tag helpers to restart

- [00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1752) would it work let's see and let's say these two okay it doesn't

- [00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1755) these two okay it doesn't work yes so tag helpers has to be

- [00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1760) work yes so tag helpers has to be uh inside build import

- [00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1766) uh inside build import okay

- [00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1782) reference has to be defined inside we've import

- [00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1785) inside we've import and

- [00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1792) okay so what is the import let's continue reading it

- [00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1794) continue reading it what is underscore view imports.cshtml

- [00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1802) underscoreviewimports.cshtml file is usually placed in the views folder it

- [00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1805) is usually placed in the views folder it is used to include the common name

- [00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1807) is used to include the common name spaces

- [00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1807) spaces so we do not have to include them in

- [00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1809) so we do not have to include them in every view that needs those name spaces

- [00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1811) every view that needs those name spaces so you see this is used to include

- [00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1814) so you see this is used to include common name spaces such as

- [00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1816) common name spaces such as tag helpers so this is the difference

- [00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1819) tag helpers so this is the difference for common name spaces we use viv

- [00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1821) for common name spaces we use viv import for other things that we want

- [00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1825) import for other things that we want to be visible on every page for example

- [00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1827) to be visible on every page for example i can

- [00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1828) i can type here something as this is the

- [00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1832) type here something as this is the beginning of restart

- [00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1836) beginning of restart and let's see how it will be visible

- [00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1844) and it will be in restart okay okay so this is what we need to

- [00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1848) okay okay so this is what we need to understand

- [00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1851) understand all right so we can continue our

- [00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1860) tutorial this is the way we define minimum

- [00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1861) minimum length and yes

- [00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1869) just like the tag helper for the input element the text area tag helper makes

- [00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1871) element the text area tag helper makes it easier to make a strong connection

- [00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1873) it easier to make a strong connection between the model

- [00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1874) between the model and the text areas you need in your

- [00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1876) and the text areas you need in your views definitely

- [00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1878) views definitely it is working and the select talk helper

- [00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1881) it is working and the select talk helper a new one

- [00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1890) the select tag helper the select tag helper will allow you

- [00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1891) helper will allow you to easily create html select elements

- [00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1894) to easily create html select elements based on your data

- [00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1896) based on your data like drop down box in c we have drop

- [00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1899) like drop down box in c we have drop down box

- [00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1900) down box and or drop down list this

- [00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1903) and or drop down list this is a drop down is used to i mean in web

- [00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1906) is a drop down is used to i mean in web forms or

- [00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1907) forms or epf or windows forms

- [00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1910) epf or windows forms uh so this is the equivalent of that

- [00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1915) uh so this is the equivalent of that but before doing that you see this is

- [00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1917) but before doing that you see this is the beginning of the weave start it is

- [00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1918) the beginning of the weave start it is at the top of our

- [00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1921) at the top of our page as you can see

- [00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1928) okay let's continue data this is one of the more advanced tag

- [00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1930) this is one of the more advanced tag helpers with more functionality than

- [00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1932) helpers with more functionality than what we see in eg the text area tag

- [00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1934) what we see in eg the text area tag helper but as you'll see

- [00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1936) helper but as you'll see that just means it will save you even

- [00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1937) that just means it will save you even more keystrokes when using it in your

- [00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1939) more keystrokes when using it in your views

- [00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1940) views you will also notice that because the

- [00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1942) you will also notice that because the select tag helper does a bit more for

- [00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1944) select tag helper does a bit more for you the examples in this article are a bit

- [00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1947) the examples in this article are a bit more complex compared to previous

- [00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1948) more complex compared to previous articles

- [00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1950) articles first of all let's discuss what the

- [00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1952) first of all let's discuss what the select element does

- [00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1954) select element does here's a pure html example

- [00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1958) here's a pure html example okay so this is the pure html example

- [00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1961) okay so this is the pure html example and it generates an

- [00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1962) and it generates an output like this okay

- [00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1970) this is a standard classic html nothing as

- [00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1971) as asp or c-sharp or visual

- [00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1979) so as you can see the select element will render one or several options in a

- [00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1981) will render one or several options in a list by default a drop down list allowing you

- [00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1984) by default a drop down list allowing you to select an option

- [00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1986) to select an option the options are provided with option

- [00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1987) the options are provided with option elements and each of them can have a

- [00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1989) elements and each of them can have a value

- [00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1990) value eg and id as well as a text label in

- [00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1992) eg and id as well as a text label in this case a movie title

- [00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1995) this case a movie title however i am teaching

- [00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=1998) however i am teaching how to bind custom

- [00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=2001) how to bind custom class objects list

- [00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=2005) class objects list drop down list or combo boxes in

- [00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=2013) programming lecture in my object-oriented

- [00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=2015) lecture in my object-oriented programming lecture

- [00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=2016) programming lecture so uh if you are interested in

- [00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=2020) so uh if you are interested in that c-sharp programming you should

- [00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=2022) that c-sharp programming you should definitely watch my introduction to

- [00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=2024) definitely watch my introduction to programming advanced programming

- [00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=2029) and object-oriented programming lecture playlists

- [00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=2029) playlists okay all of them are on our are on our

- [00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=2033) okay all of them are on our are on our channel available for free

- [00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=2036) channel available for free there's no need to hand code all those

- [00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=2038) there's no need to hand code all those option tags we can have them

- [00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=2040) option tags we can have them automatically generated

- [00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=2041) automatically generated based on a data source usually a

- [00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=2043) based on a data source usually a database with the select tag helper

- [00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=2046) database with the select tag helper the foreign items attributes as with

- [00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=2050) the foreign items attributes as with several of the other tag helpers

- [00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=2052) several of the other tag helpers the select tag helper has the asp for

- [00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=2054) the select tag helper has the asp for attribute

- [00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=2055) attribute which will allow you to bind its value

- [00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=2057) which will allow you to bind its value to a specific property on the model

- [00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=2059) to a specific property on the model in addition to that an attribute called

- [00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=2061) in addition to that an attribute called asp items is available

- [00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=2063) asp items is available which will allow you to provide a data

- [00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=2065) which will allow you to provide a data source for the select element

- [00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=2068) source for the select element okay so sv4 will bind to

- [00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=2071) okay so sv4 will bind to a property specific and asp items will

- [00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=2075) a property specific and asp items will bind it to a data source so

- [00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=2079) bind it to a data source so i am assuming that asp items will be a

- [00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=2082) i am assuming that asp items will be a list or an array something enumerable

- [00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=2086) or an array something enumerable and sv4 will be the selected element

- [00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=2089) and sv4 will be the selected element from my assumption

- [00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=2097) the asp for attributes needs a property on the model to bind to

- [00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=2098) on the model to bind to and the asp items needs a list of

- [00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=2100) and the asp items needs a list of possible options

- [00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=2102) possible options while both things can come from the same

- [00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=2104) while both things can come from the same model it's often more practical to

- [00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=2106) model it's often more practical to create a specific view model for the

- [00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=2107) create a specific view model for the purpose

- [00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=2108) purpose which will combine the model you are

- [00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=2110) which will combine the model you are working within the list of possible

- [00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=2111) working within the list of possible options

- [00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=2113) options an example of this could be a form for

- [00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=2115) an example of this could be a form for editing a user

- [00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=2116) editing a user where you want to be able to edit basic

- [00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=2117) where you want to be able to edit basic stuff like name email etc

- [00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=2119) stuff like name email etc but also allow the user to select which

- [00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=2121) but also allow the user to select which country they live in

- [00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=2123) country they live in this list of countries would likely come

- [00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=2125) this list of countries would likely come from another source

- [00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=2126) from another source eg a database or from a list of

- [00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=2128) eg a database or from a list of hand-picked countries

- [00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=2130) hand-picked countries in this case you could create a view

- [00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=2132) in this case you could create a view model like this

- [00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=2135) model like this okay so this is simply a model

- [00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=2137) okay so this is simply a model [Music]

- [00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=2142) [Music] and

- [00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=2145) and okay and something like that

- [00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=2171) okay i will compose our own example however i am more interested in which

- [00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=2174) however i am more interested in which list with key and values okay so this is

- [00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=2178) list with key and values okay so this is so simple

- [00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=2179) so simple something so simple uh but let's start

- [00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=2183) something so simple uh but let's start from simple one and then

- [00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=2186) from simple one and then we can see the more complex

- [00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=2190) we can see the more complex ones

- [00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=2198) okay so let's start with a simple example and let's code ourselves

- [00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=2201) example and let's code ourselves instead of

- [00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=2207) copy pasting so i am going to have a property string

- [00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=2208) property string as our country and then i'm going to

- [00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=2211) as our country and then i'm going to have a list

- [00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=2215) have a list property list thing

- [00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=2229) okay honestly country i will set it by default something like

- [00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=2233) i will set it by default something like is this turkey

- [00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=2236) is this turkey and

- [00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=2244) celia and united states and

- [00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=2247) united states and germany okay

- [00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=2250) germany okay and then we need to

- [00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=2254) and then we need to generate our

- [00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=2257) generate our select tab so let's add it to

- [00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=2268) here okay so we are going to have select

- [00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=2271) we are going to have select an asp for

- [00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=2279) sr country and asp list items you see it has automatically

- [00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=2292) how did we name it is it named as [Music]

- [00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=2294) [Music] lsp items will come from

- [00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=2309) but why it didn't automatically complete it

- [00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=2311) it okay let's see if it gives an order yeah

- [00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=2315) okay let's see if it gives an order yeah okay it says that this is not available

- [00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=2318) okay it says that this is not available in

- [00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=2320) in current context and why

- [00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=2324) current context and why we are using model we have made it

- [00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=2328) we are using model we have made it public

- [00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=2329) public list

- [00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=2337) but it says it is not available it is also get and set

- [00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=2339) also get and set therefore it's a property

- [00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=2369) i see so this is not the format of doing asp items

- [00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=2375) let's look for a better example as items let me see example

- [00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=2398) add parentheses new select list and inside that

- [00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=2403) new select list and inside that now

- [00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=2410) still not available new select list modern dot ic

- [00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=2414) modern dot ic model dot lst country then

- [00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=2417) model dot lst country then t model selected value so select it

- [00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=2420) t model selected value so select it where you will be

- [00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=2425) where you will be nothing i think i won't give a selected

- [00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=2427) nothing i think i won't give a selected body

- [00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=2428) body yeah so now we should be able to see

- [00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=2432) yeah so now we should be able to see the selected item here

- [00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=2438) the selected item here on our code behind

- [00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=2458) okay so by default it is starting from zero index let's select germany

- [00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=2461) zero index let's select germany and test it okay so

- [00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=2465) and test it okay so in our model okay sr country is bound to

- [00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=2469) in our model okay sr country is bound to germany as we wanted

- [00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=2471) germany as we wanted yes it is working as expected

- [00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=2481) and now we can move to the more advanced example so let's assume that

- [00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=2485) example so let's assume that we have a list of

- [00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=2489) we have a list of something different i mean a class

- [00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=2492) something different i mean a class okay so uh

- [00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=2495) okay so uh cs countries

- [00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=2498) cs countries and in this example i will uh define

- [00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=2501) and in this example i will uh define something different

- [00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=2504) something different so here we have public property its

- [00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=2508) so here we have public property its sr country name

- [00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=2511) sr country name string and then we are going to have

- [00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=2515) string and then we are going to have country codes okay all country yeah

- [00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=2518) country codes okay all country yeah country code

- [00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=2520) country code okay

- [00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=2532) and then we are going to have a list of country class

- [00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=2534) country class list of country class

- [00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=2538) list of country class this will ucs countries

- [00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=2541) this will ucs countries and now i will define it

- [00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=2544) and now i will define it in here as nav

- [00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=2548) in here as nav says countries

- [00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=2551) says countries and here i will define

- [00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=2554) and here i will define country name as turkey

- [00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=2563) and country code will be tr and let's add few ones

- [00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=2567) tr and let's add few ones like united states

- [00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=2580) okay germany is ga i think country coach

- [00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=2596) okay we are using e support so let's check germany

- [00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=2598) check germany oh it is d a i was remembering

- [00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=2601) oh it is d a i was remembering incorrectly

- [00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=2602) incorrectly germany ea okay it doesn't matter

- [00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=2605) germany ea okay it doesn't matter how many we define we just need to we

- [00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=2608) how many we define we just need to we just need to have an example

- [00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=2611) just need to have an example and now i am going to have another

- [00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=2614) and now i am going to have another select but this time

- [00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=2615) select but this time we will also bind it to its

- [00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=2619) we will also bind it to its selected country code okay so this time

- [00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=2629) uh let's also have another parameter as prop

- [00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=2633) parameter as prop string and sr

- [00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=2637) string and sr selected country

- [00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=2640) selected country code okay

- [00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=2648) and sp4 list of country not this time we will use list of

- [00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=2651) not this time we will use list of country class

- [00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=2653) country class selected audio will be

- [00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=2674) no let's check from the example ah we just provide string here that

- [00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=2677) ah we just provide string here that makes more sense

- [00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=2679) makes more sense so we provide the string of the

- [00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=2683) so we provide the string of the this is the value the value

- [00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=2687) this is the value the value we want to get is as our country calls

- [00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=2695) and the display item yes string data text field

- [00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=2696) text field which will be displayed to the user as

- [00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=2698) which will be displayed to the user as our country

- [00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=2700) our country name okay

- [00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=2704) name okay and yeah that's it let's start and see

- [00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=2707) and yeah that's it let's start and see if it is working or not

- [00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=2709) if it is working or not uh i am exactly showing this how to

- [00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=2712) uh i am exactly showing this how to achieve it in

- [00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=2718) achieve it in my other lecture as i have explained in

- [00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=2721) my other lecture as i have explained in my introduction to prog

- [00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=2723) my introduction to prog in my advanced programming lecture or in

- [00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=2725) in my advanced programming lecture or in my object oriented program lecture

- [00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=2727) my object oriented program lecture for desktop applications okay i am

- [00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=2731) for desktop applications okay i am picking united

- [00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=2731) picking united states and see which data we are getting

- [00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=2739) okay so the selected country code is this time in

- [00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=2740) this time in u.s not the united states exactly

- [00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=2743) u.s not the united states exactly working as we wanted

- [00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=2746) working as we wanted if we inspect the code we can see that

- [00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=2749) if we inspect the code we can see that id is

- [00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=2750) id is sr selected country code name is sr

- [00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=2753) sr selected country code name is sr selected country code

- [00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=2754) selected country code class valid area invalid false and

- [00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=2757) class valid area invalid false and inside it we have option value

- [00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=2761) inside it we have option value options with value okay

- [00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=2765) options with value okay so let's note that

- [00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=2772) how to generate stock helper having select options

- [00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=2780) how to bind select options to a property

- [00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=2783) to a property in the model

- [00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=2786) in the model how to um

- [00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=2790) how to um find selected option value

- [00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=2793) find selected option value to a property and display

- [00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=2796) to a property and display another property

- [00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=2810) okay [Music]

- [00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=2811) [Music] all right and on these

- [00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=2815) all right and on these things i can have

- [00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=2819) things i can have all kind of validations as well

- [00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=2822) all kind of validations as well like i can tell that the country cut

- [00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=2825) like i can tell that the country cut will be a string but

- [00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=2827) will be a string but we are providing this so it is not

- [00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=2829) we are providing this so it is not necessary that is not something that

- [00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=2839) users can change actually i wonder that what happens if user changes

- [00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=2842) what happens if user changes uh so can we trust the data that is

- [00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=2845) uh so can we trust the data that is being

- [00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=2846) being sent so so i will pick

- [00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=2850) sent so so i will pick uh by the way you see it is

- [00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=2853) uh by the way you see it is increased after the prospect so

- [00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=2858) increased after the prospect so that is kind of problematic we need to

- [00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=2912) oh probably i know the reason because in our code behind

- [00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=2914) our code behind we are putting model

- [00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=2917) we are putting model into temp data and that

- [00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=2920) into temp data and that is just doubling our list

- [00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=2925) is just doubling our list okay and yeah let's first

- [00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=2929) okay and yeah let's first test our case

- [00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=2933) test our case i think we can trust the data that will

- [00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=2935) i think we can trust the data that will be sent back

- [00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=2936) be sent back for example united states and i change

- [00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=2939) for example united states and i change it

- [00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=2940) it send data

- [00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=2946) okay i need to put a breakpoint at the code behind

- [00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=2957) okay i am modifying this to something as being a malicious user

- [00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=2960) as being a malicious user yes you see i'm getting the modified

- [00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=2962) yes you see i'm getting the modified data

- [00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=2963) data so you can't trust it directly you have

- [00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=2966) so you can't trust it directly you have to verify it

- [00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=2968) to verify it and it can be done whether that this

- [00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=2971) and it can be done whether that this list contains it or not simply

- [00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=2975) contains it or not simply so you need to verify it let's uh

- [00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=2976) so you need to verify it let's uh [Music]

- [00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=2980) [Music] make our verification how can we do that

- [00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=2983) make our verification how can we do that we can do it by

- [00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=3020) and custom requirement yeah we need to code a custom requirement for this

- [00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=3023) code a custom requirement for this in as in our

- [00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=3027) in as in our previous

- [00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=3034) lecture where was this what was our custom requirements

- [00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=3041) here i'm going to have a custom requirement

- [00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=3043) requirement and i will explain to you how can it be

- [00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=3046) and i will explain to you how can it be done so

- [00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=3055) yeah this was that and do we have a custom environment here

- [00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=3074) easier but which one should we prefer

- [00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=3093) okay what i want to do is i want to automatically

- [00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=3095) automatically verify that the selected

- [00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=3099) verify that the selected data from uh can't record is valid or

- [00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=3103) data from uh can't record is valid or not okay so that is my aim and i am going to

- [00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=3106) okay so that is my aim and i am going to achieve it with a custom

- [00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=3108) achieve it with a custom validation my custom country

- [00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=3112) validation my custom country called validation and

- [00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=3117) called validation and it will get the model and inside this

- [00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=3121) it will get the model and inside this model what i'm going to do is i'm going

- [00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=3125) model what i'm going to do is i'm going to make a

- [00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=3125) to make a footage of list of country class

- [00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=3129) footage of list of country class and it has to be like this

- [00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=3136) but since this is instance based it's i think we can't use it

- [00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=3138) think we can't use it so i need to make something like this

- [00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=3140) so i need to make something like this lecture 10

- [00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=3147) so this model name is lecture 10 okay lecture 10 temp

- [00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=3151) okay lecture 10 temp new lecture 10 so i am composing an

- [00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=3154) new lecture 10 so i am composing an instance of this class

- [00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=3156) instance of this class in my validation code and in or

- [00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=3160) in my validation code and in or i can make this as static

- [00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=3163) i can make this as static then it i wouldn't be needed to

- [00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=3167) then it i wouldn't be needed to generate instance of that so

- [00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=3176) list of country classes and here country

- [00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=3185) and actually it would be even easier like if list of country classes select

- [00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=3190) like if list of country classes select i am going to use a link you

- [00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=3194) i am going to use a link you that's pr that country codes to

- [00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=3197) that's pr that country codes to list contains

- [00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=3201) list contains and evaluate that

- [00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=3204) and evaluate that i think i need to convert it back to my

- [00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=3207) i think i need to convert it back to my model as

- [00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=3216) yeah it will be used for this so it will be string

- [00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=3229) basically yeah if it is not containing then i will return uh

- [00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=3232) then i will return uh airbrush like

- [00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=3236) airbrush like uh this

- [00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=3239) uh this new validation results

- [00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=3243) new validation results are you trying to hack our website

- [00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=3246) are you trying to hack our website are you trying to make

- [00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=3250) are you trying to make our website

- [00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=3258) otherwise it will return success and i am going to

- [00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=3259) am going to set this to yes

- [00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=3264) set this to yes like this simply and let's test it out

- [00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=3284) oh now i can access it as an instance so i have to access it as

- [00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=3291) class reference and which is available in lecture 10

- [00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=3293) in lecture 10 dot models dot lecture 10

- [00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=3296) dot models dot lecture 10 dots let's see countries here

- [00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=3299) dots let's see countries here since we have made it static now i have

- [00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=3302) since we have made it static now i have to give full path

- [00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=3304) to give full path or i have to add a using here

- [00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=3308) or i have to add a using here so you're using this if i make this

- [00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=3312) so you're using this if i make this as using then i don't have to provide

- [00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=3315) as using then i don't have to provide the full pad

- [00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=3317) the full pad like this it will still

- [00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=3320) like this it will still work but i need to make this as static i

- [00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=3323) work but i need to make this as static i think

- [00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=3325) think static dot

- [00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=3349) using static yeah now i'm working using static

- [00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=3351) yeah now i'm working using static lecture term models

- [00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=3353) lecture term models you see this is the directive

- [00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=3361) you see this is the directive okay how to

- [00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=3365) okay how to use using static to

- [00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=3368) use using static to access static properties

- [00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=3372) access static properties of non static or

- [00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=3376) of non static or let's say yeah non-static

- [00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=3379) let's say yeah non-static classes instance created

- [00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=3388) okay and now i'm going to send a

- [00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=3391) i'm going to send a data with a modification

- [00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=3395) data with a modification as germany and

- [00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=3398) as germany and i will modify something like this let's

- [00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=3400) i will modify something like this let's add some data here

- [00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=3402) add some data here and

- [00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=3416) however this should not be the case because selected country code is here

- [00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=3420) because selected country code is here so we have an error somewhere

- [00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=3443) maybe if you have we have a buggered code let's try

- [00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=3446) buggered code let's try as united states change it

- [00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=3451) as united states change it sent oh it is not even getting

- [00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=3455) sent oh it is not even getting inside that

- [00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=3473) let's open lecture eight get such interesting

- [00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=3495) the problem is it is not entering inside the validation code

- [00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=3516) right now so this is kind of challenging this is not inside the lecture eight

- [00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=3520) this is not inside the lecture eight and it will make the same ah

- [00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=3523) and it will make the same ah uh we have put it inside the actual

- [00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=3527) uh we have put it inside the actual tan maybe that is why it is not working

- [00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=3530) tan maybe that is why it is not working let's move to

- [00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=3531) let's move to move this to out of the class

- [00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=3543) okay now what does it tell now we can access it

- [00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=3558) because we need to use lectures 10 now these

- [00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=3561) lectures 10 now these standard process

- [00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=3580) i don't think it should make a difference but

- [00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=3583) difference but i don't know

- [00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=3596) and it is here validation attribute is valid object value validation context

- [01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=3611) lecture 8 controller maybe we made something else here

- [01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=3635) i am getting i am even able to post no not okay let's make something like

- [01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=3639) no not okay let's make something like this

- [01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=3641) this states

- [01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=3654) let's change the value sand data yeah it is still validating

- [01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=3669) ah i think i know the reason yeah yeah i know the reason

- [01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=3672) yeah yeah i know the reason because we are trying to validate in

- [01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=3675) because we are trying to validate in correcting different things

- [01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=3678) correcting different things so this attribute

- [01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=3683) so this attribute will be validated not here but here

- [01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=3687) will be validated not here but here because this is the value we are setting

- [01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=3689) because this is the value we are setting okay

- [01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=3690) okay and now it will work i am pretty sure of

- [01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=3693) and now it will work i am pretty sure of it

- [01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=3694) it let's run the application to see

- [01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=3703) by the way we are returning a content i think we should

- [01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=3704) think we should we need to return validation results

- [01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=3719) but since i won't be returning my model lighting it won't be visible to the

- [01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=3720) lighting it won't be visible to the users

- [01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=3722) users okay okay and united states

- [01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=3727) okay okay and united states okay validated now let's change

- [01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=3733) okay validated now let's change the data

- [01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=3742) okay this is returned i think i can add the error message of the

- [01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=3746) i can add the error message of the validation

- [01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=3754) and how can i do that i can do it with i think

- [01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=3756) think let's add a br here

- [01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=3764) and plus model state dot where is the errors

- [01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=3775) error message how to get it let's see validation get error message

- [01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=3782) validation get error message let me see

- [01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=3787) validation somebody here it was somewhere here

- [01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=3797) oh no no not here okay so there is more than errors

- [01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=3818) um maybe it will be his model my model

- [01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=3849) model state is valid error message

- [01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=3856) okay yeah someone will already ask it that

- [01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=3880) oh it is like did i see okay so this will select all elements inside model state

- [01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=3883) select all elements inside model state and it will

- [01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=3884) and it will get the value of

- [01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=3888) get the value of errors and then i will use

- [01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=3892) errors and then i will use this to sync join

- [01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=3897) this to sync join so separator will be

- [01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=3900) so separator will be a new line tag and

- [01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=3904) a new line tag and this will be the list okay let's see

- [01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=3907) this will be the list okay let's see now we should be able to see

- [01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=3910) now we should be able to see which errors are we getting when our

- [01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=3913) which errors are we getting when our model state is not valid

- [01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=3915) model state is not valid so we are not just displaying some

- [01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=3919) so we are not just displaying some blind data to the user we are telling

- [01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=3921) blind data to the user we are telling that

- [01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=3922) that you have sent some invalidator the

- [01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=3924) you have sent some invalidator the server and we are

- [01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=3926) server and we are telling where is the error

- [01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=3933) okay and how to add a custom validation to

- [01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=3937) how to add a custom validation to a custom class

- [01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=3945) how to return users the custom validation error from

- [01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=3949) custom validation error from both behind in controller

- [01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=3958) by using moodle state errors okay

- [01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=3966) okay now let's try let's select germany

- [01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=3975) let's change the value to something like this

- [01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=3976) this okay now no so

- [01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=3981) okay now no so let's put a breakpoint here to

- [01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=3984) let's put a breakpoint here to debug and see what kind of data we are

- [01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=3990) debug and see what kind of data we are getting

- [01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=3992) getting so model state has

- [01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=3995) so model state has five elements here

- [01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=3998) five elements here and inside this dictionary can i see

- [01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=4001) and inside this dictionary can i see that

- [01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=4008) no let's move to the next step and in errors we have one error

- [01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=4012) and in errors we have one error and yeah error message so i need to

- [01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=4016) and yeah error message so i need to check error message

- [01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=4017) check error message [Music]

- [01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=4018) [Music] not the editor itself

- [01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=4023) not the editor itself so basically what i need to do is i need

- [01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=4025) so basically what i need to do is i need to write another select

- [01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=4028) to write another select and here here that error message

- [01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=4032) and here here that error message or not i'm not able to select it

- [01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=4036) or not i'm not able to select it okay so errors zero index

- [01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=4039) okay so errors zero index and inside that i see

- [01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=4044) and inside that i see first or default then error message okay

- [01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=4048) first or default then error message okay now it should work

- [01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=4057) okay now we are able to see however you see

- [01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=4058) see the message is displayed like this

- [01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=4061) the message is displayed like this because we didn't pass it as

- [01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=4062) because we didn't pass it as long because it is passed as encoded

- [01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=4076) i need to return this content as love okay so let's also do that

- [01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=4079) as love okay so let's also do that yes without that nvc return content

- [01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=4083) yes without that nvc return content raw html not

- [01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=4086) raw html not as encoded

- [01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=4099) also return content as well html not encoded html

- [01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=4103) html not encoded html so how do we do it

- [01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=4107) so how do we do it okay it is simply like this nice

- [01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=4111) okay it is simply like this nice okay let's add it

- [01:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=4118) okay let's add it okay

- [01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=4127) i think i can make it look better with simple formatting

- [01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=4130) simple formatting like um this

- [01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=4147) okay and [Music]

- [01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=4153) so this is link you and first of default yeah you see i

- [01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=4157) yeah you see i i didn't know how to select errors so i

- [01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=4161) i didn't know how to select errors so i did debugging and in debugging i check it

- [01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=4165) debugging and in debugging i check it what kind of objects are returned then i

- [01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=4168) what kind of objects are returned then i found my way to how to do it so

- [01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=4171) found my way to how to do it so debugging is

- [01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=4173) debugging is extremely useful how to

- [01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=4177) extremely useful how to utilize debugging to figure

- [01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=4180) utilize debugging to figure out and find out how to

- [01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=4183) out and find out how to access or do something

- [01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=4187) access or do something or some property

- [01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=4190) or some property of um

- [01:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=4198) objects okay yeah i think it was a good description now let's try

- [01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=4201) description now let's try it with a hacking

- [01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=4205) it with a hacking drawing

- [01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=4213) okay now it's all good because we didn't provide

- [01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=4213) provide we didn't change the correct one and now

- [01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=4218) we didn't change the correct one and now okay html is still not parsed as html

- [01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=4222) okay html is still not parsed as html oh i know because i didn't lose it

- [01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=4268) and yeah i'm changing value okay okay still not working

- [01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=4271) okay okay still not working interesting why

- [01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=4323) so we define a content type something so let's put it here message

- [01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=4328) so let's put it here message then we set the content type and we just

- [01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=4330) then we set the content type and we just return to result

- [01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=4333) return to result content and content type

- [01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=4351) an electronic content instead of a view

- [01:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=4370) okay now i think it will work all this can we also work

- [01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=4390) okay let's see if this will work or not i think this is the most elegant

- [01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=4412) yes now working as html not allow content

- [01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=4414) content okay i will take a pause here

- [01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=4437) working with enums another very common usage scenario for the select tag helper

- [01:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=4439) usage scenario for the select tag helper is in combination with enumerations

- [01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=4441) is in combination with enumerations enums

- [01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=4443) enums an enumeration is a list of possible

- [01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=4445) an enumeration is a list of possible choices defined in code

- [01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=4447) choices defined in code with each option corresponding to a

- [01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=4449) with each option corresponding to a number

- [01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=4450) number this is very useful in a lot of

- [01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=4452) this is very useful in a lot of situations and you will find

- [01:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=4453) situations and you will find lots of enumerations in the framework an

- [01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=4456) lots of enumerations in the framework an example of this is the day of week

- [01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=4458) example of this is the day of week enumeration

- [01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=4459) enumeration used for the property with the same name

- [01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=4461) used for the property with the same name on the daytime struct

- [01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=4463) on the daytime struct it's defined like this okay so

- [01:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=4466) it's defined like this okay so uh this is day of weak enumeration

- [01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=4469) uh this is day of weak enumeration i think it is already defined in daytime

- [01:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=4473) i think it is already defined in daytime struck

- [01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=4475) struck we can also define our own

- [01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=4483) enumerations so

- [01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=4502) okay i'm going to define it in a lecture 10 model here

- [01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=4506) a lecture 10 model here public union web user validation status

- [01:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=4510) public union web user validation status unknown display not verified yet

- [01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=4513) unknown display not verified yet i think we can even assign values

- [01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=4517) i think we can even assign values and integers and

- [01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=4531) i'm like zero refined by email like bond verified by

- [01:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=4535) refined by email like bond verified by online okay now let's

- [01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=4539) online okay now let's compose

- [01:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=4552) i'm and then let's compose a property for selected enumeration

- [01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=4555) selected enumeration and how can we do it we can do it with

- [01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=4560) and how can we do it we can do it with prop

- [01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=4572) okay validation status all right and then

- [01:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=4583) let's get into our ch html here for validation

- [01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=4586) here for validation status items will be from our

- [01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=4590) status items will be from our enumeration and

- [01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=4594) enumeration and let's see if it will work directly

- [01:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=4597) let's see if it will work directly or we need some extra code

- [01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=4601) or we need some extra code okay like this and i probably

- [01:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=4605) okay like this and i probably don't need even this

- [01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=4608) don't need even this okay i think this is will be annual list

- [01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=4611) okay i think this is will be annual list or something like that

- [01:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=4614) or something like that i'm not seeing a tutorial

- [01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=4622) i'm not seeing a tutorial yeah html get elimination list ic

- [01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=4626) yeah html get elimination list ic so this is a little bit different

- [01:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=4630) so this is a little bit different it is like html dots

- [01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=4635) it is like html dots get enumeration in our case lecture nine

- [01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=4638) get enumeration in our case lecture nine dots model starts um

- [01:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=4642) dots model starts um lecture ten dots um

- [01:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=4647) lecture ten dots um no it is not available there

- [01:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=4660) i have to put this inside lecture 10 class so it will be available

- [01:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=4676) okay web users validation status okay let's see if it will work or not

- [01:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=4679) okay let's see if it will work or not i'm going to put a breakpoint

- [01:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=4686) and let's run the application to see we are getting the

- [01:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=4688) are getting the uh selected enumeration or not

- [01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=4709) by the way if you have noticed that uh we are

- [01:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=4710) we are having a display attack attribute here

- [01:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=4714) having a display attack attribute here display name okay

- [01:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=4719) display name okay so yeah we are here seeing the names

- [01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=4724) so yeah we are here seeing the names okay and let's send the data

- [01:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=4729) okay and let's send the data and in here let's

- [01:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=4732) and in here let's see okay sr

- [01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=4735) see okay sr title

- [01:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=4743) where is the verification validation status is validated by phone

- [01:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=4746) validation status is validated by phone yeah

- [01:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=4747) yeah you see validated by phone we can even

- [01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=4751) you see validated by phone we can even get its integer data such

- [01:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=4754) its integer data such as varnish

- [01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=4758) as varnish [Music]

- [01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=4760) [Music] validation numeric data

- [01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=4764) validation numeric data numeric value will be equal to my model

- [01:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=4767) numeric value will be equal to my model dot

- [01:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=4768) dot validation status

- [01:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=4771) validation status and simply i will get it as

- [01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=4774) and simply i will get it as integers okay

- [01:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=4793) okay uh how what are any limitations how to set custom display

- [01:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=4796) how to set custom display name to animations

- [01:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=4800) name to animations or to assign

- [01:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=4808) eliminations of the assign numeric bodies

- [01:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=4812) numeric bodies and deeds of the assign and read

- [01:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=4827) annihilations out your mind and elimination

- [01:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=4833) and elimination to

- [01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=4856) okay it is here i'm going to check verified by phone

- [01:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=4859) verified by phone and here we are getting the value in

- [01:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=4861) and here we are getting the value in numeric two

- [01:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=4863) numeric two okay it is great of course you would

- [01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=4866) okay it is great of course you would need

- [01:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=4867) need uh validation

- [01:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=4871) uh validation i wonder if we can break the postpacket

- [01:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=4873) i wonder if we can break the postpacket data and it will

- [01:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=4875) data and it will get validated let's test that

- [01:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=4887) i will try to modify data and postback and see if it works or break

- [01:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=4889) and see if it works or break something if it gets validated or not

- [01:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=4892) something if it gets validated or not for example i will get

- [01:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=4894) for example i will get verified by phone okay so

- [01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=4898) verified by phone okay so it is like this um

- [01:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=4912) here uh it has value m you see these values are coming from

- [01:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=4916) you see these values are coming from uh enumeration itself

- [01:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=4921) uh enumeration itself so let's make this value something like

- [01:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=4923) so let's make this value something like this and this like this

- [01:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=4925) this and this like this and do a prospect okay

- [01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=4929) and do a prospect okay so it didn't get verified this is great

- [01:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=4932) so it didn't get verified this is great and if you if the enumeration is

- [01:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=4936) and if you if the enumeration is modified

- [01:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=4937) modified uh it won't work for example let's

- [01:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=4941) uh it won't work for example let's modify the text of enumeration

- [01:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=4944) modify the text of enumeration okay if you modify the text of

- [01:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=4946) okay if you modify the text of enumeration

- [01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=4948) enumeration it works but if you want to find the

- [01:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=4950) it works but if you want to find the value of enumeration then

- [01:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=4952) value of enumeration then it doesn't work okay

- [01:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=4965) okay there is also groups this is another feature

- [01:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=4972) working with groups the native html select element support grouping of data

- [01:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=4974) select element support grouping of data which basically just means that you can

- [01:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=4976) which basically just means that you can add elements which works like headers

- [01:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=4978) add elements which works like headers instead of actual elements

- [01:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=4979) instead of actual elements causing the following elements to appear

- [01:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=4981) causing the following elements to appear as a part of this group

- [01:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=4983) as a part of this group the select tag helper supports this

- [01:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=4985) the select tag helper supports this behavior as well

- [01:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=4986) behavior as well but it requires you to deliver a set of

- [01:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=4988) but it requires you to deliver a set of grouped items instead of just any kind

- [01:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=4990) grouped items instead of just any kind of objects as we saw in previous

- [01:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=4992) of objects as we saw in previous examples

- [01:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=4993) examples for this purpose you would usually

- [01:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=4995) for this purpose you would usually create a view model to contain the

- [01:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=4997) create a view model to contain the grouped items

- [01:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=4999) grouped items using microsoft okay so

- [01:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=5003) using microsoft okay so in grouped items what do we have we have

- [01:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=5006) in grouped items what do we have we have a

- [01:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=5013) public constructor here which assigns movies to a new list

- [01:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=5018) which assigns movies to a new list and it has a mobius list

- [01:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=5022) and it has a mobius list and you see this list contains selected

- [01:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=5025) and you see this list contains selected list item okay this is the key issue

- [01:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=5038) then let's continue then when creating the view model

- [01:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=5039) the view model you should create instances of the

- [01:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=5040) you should create instances of the select list item class to hold the items

- [01:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=5043) select list item class to hold the items and create an instance of the select

- [01:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=5044) and create an instance of the select list group class for each group you want

- [01:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=5046) list group class for each group you want and assign it to select list items

- [01:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=5049) and assign it to select list items it sounds more complicated than it is as

- [01:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=5051) it sounds more complicated than it is as you can see

- [01:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=5053) you can see okay so then we have select this group

- [01:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=5067) then it has group as drama movies here and

- [01:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=5071) drama movies here and list item like this so select this

- [01:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=5075) list item like this so select this item

- [01:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=5089) okay first we are going to compose a new class

- [01:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=5090) class such as um

- [01:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=5098) yeah unless we also list we can also define

- [01:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=5099) define uh

- [01:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=5121) okay for select this item i need to add a reference

- [01:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=5127) you see microsoft asp.net core and we see rendering

- [01:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=5130) see rendering and it will be

- [01:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=5138) my or let's say movies list okay and it will be new

- [01:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=5143) movies list okay and it will be new so it will be initialized and

- [01:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=5146) so it will be initialized and [Music]

- [01:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=5154) at our controller i am going to set it

- [01:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=5174) item okay so to be able to use it i also need to add

- [01:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=5176) need to add you know not like this select this group

- [01:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=5179) you know not like this select this group oh i see

- [01:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=5188) nameless item group okay select this group

- [01:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=5192) okay select this group okay i'm missing rendering so the first

- [01:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=5194) okay i'm missing rendering so the first group will be

- [01:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=5204) drama drama group we will need select this group and

- [01:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=5206) we will need select this group and inside select this group we have

- [01:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=5208) inside select this group we have disabled and named

- [01:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=5210) disabled and named so the name will be dramas

- [01:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=5222) okay there is some problem here we don't set this yes

- [01:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=5224) set this yes and then we are going to have

- [01:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=5227) and then we are going to have let's say action group action

- [01:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=5231) let's say action group action group grammar movies okay

- [01:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=5235) group grammar movies okay quiz and action

- [01:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=5238) quiz and action okay and then

- [01:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=5253) my model dots um moving this and we equal to new uh

- [01:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=5256) and we equal to new uh select this item group and here's

- [01:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=5261) select this item group and here's okay we'll insert this item

- [01:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=5266) okay we'll insert this item there is group and text

- [01:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=5269) there is group and text but why it is not listed

- [01:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=5300) oh i see the reason i guess this is a method overloading so there

- [01:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=5302) this is a method overloading so there are

- [01:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=5303) are inter inch capacity and

- [01:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=5307) inter inch capacity and collection if you make it like this then

- [01:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=5310) collection if you make it like this then what do we get

- [01:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=5329) okay first i will define something like this like this item

- [01:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=5332) this like this item first movie

- [01:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=5337) first movie new segments item then

- [01:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=5340) new segments item then first movie dot oh now

- [01:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=5343) first movie dot oh now we can set it i see okay so let's make

- [01:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=5346) we can set it i see okay so let's make it like this

- [01:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=5350) it like this okay

- [01:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=5357) i see i see now okay now i don't need it my model that movie list

- [01:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=5361) my model that movie list equal to news like this item

- [01:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=5364) equal to news like this item group and inside here i will

- [01:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=5367) group and inside here i will set new select this item and here now i

- [01:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=5370) set new select this item and here now i can set that

- [01:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=5372) can set that your group will be equal to

- [01:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=5375) your group will be equal to drama group then text

- [01:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=5379) drama group then text will be equal to okay

- [01:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=5382) will be equal to okay what are the drama movies for scum

- [01:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=5386) what are the drama movies for scum okay then i will set a value for that

- [01:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=5389) okay then i will set a value for that as one why and let's say its

- [01:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=5393) as one why and let's say its id is one so value is expecting a string

- [01:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=5398) id is one so value is expecting a string therefore one then i will define the

- [01:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=5401) therefore one then i will define the name

- [01:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=5402) name another one like this so

- [01:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=5406) another one like this so let's add another movie to here

- [01:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=5414) this time white club fight club is not very much drama but yeah let's make

- [01:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=5417) not very much drama but yeah let's make it like this

- [01:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=5418) it like this then let's add

- [01:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=5422) then let's add another one as action group

- [01:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=5427) another one as action group this time let's say action movies

- [01:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=5430) this time let's say action movies matrix i don't know if it can be counted

- [01:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=5432) matrix i don't know if it can be counted with action

- [01:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=5434) with action and that's another one this time

- [01:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=5438) and that's another one this time let's say mortal kombat okay

- [01:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=5448) okay and yeah finish it here we remove this okay

- [01:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=5451) we remove this okay so

- [01:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=5459) by the way i will assign this in constructor so that i can directly

- [01:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=5463) in constructor so that i can directly assign it to my

- [01:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=5473) drop down list and how am i going to assign it so do we have a

- [01:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=5476) am i going to assign it so do we have a constructor of lecture 10

- [01:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=5483) probably no public lecture 10 this will be the constructors

- [01:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=5487) this will be the constructors and here we will set this dot movie list

- [01:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=5491) and here we will set this dot movie list equal to this

- [01:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=5494) equal to this and for grouping to work

- [01:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=5504) and for grouping to work what do we need i don't know

- [01:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=5507) what do we need i don't know if grouping was more

- [01:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=5535) here so what we want to read is select list item okay

- [01:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=5540) is select list item okay therefore we are going to generate a

- [01:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=5542) therefore we are going to generate a property as

- [01:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=5544) property as probe select list

- [01:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=5547) probe select list item and

- [01:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=5550) item and select that movie okay

- [01:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=5555) select that movie okay so this will be our

- [01:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=5557) so this will be our [Music]

- [01:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=5559) [Music] binding and in our list

- [01:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=5563) binding and in our list let's see how do we set it in the

- [01:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=5580) probably it is same as here and let's set it like this

- [01:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=5627) okay and oh it is not bound so we need to set i think

- [01:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=5638) the read value and display thing display name so

- [01:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=5641) display name so this is the selected value i think

- [01:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=5645) this is the selected value i think so the selected value will be since this

- [01:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=5648) so the selected value will be since this is the select

- [01:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=5650) is the select list list select list item list

- [01:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=5714) here i think i am seeing that okay there is value and text

- [01:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=5770) our separate items is more than select name my day

- [01:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=5792) okay so you have to leave place your question and look for other options

- [01:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=5796) question and look for other options okay there is text value here

- [01:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=5799) okay there is text value here and how it is

- [01:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=5824) okay this is what we are getting exactly

- [01:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=5837) then maybe i need to define text and value to be able to see

- [01:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=5840) value to be able to see and what what will happen to group i

- [01:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=5842) and what what will happen to group i don't know text

- [01:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=5850) i wonder if there's group name selected earlier yeah there

- [01:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=5853) selected earlier yeah there is also data group fields

- [01:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=5867) provide it as data group field will be group

- [01:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=5893) so maybe this will be i don't know let's provide it like this or

- [01:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=5895) provide it like this or let's make it hand mode

- [01:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=5898) let's make it hand mode i think it will work let's try it

- [01:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=5921) in the tutorial did they display how to do it

- [01:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=5945) maybe here oh you select this id title

- [01:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=5953) id title okay no it is not working

- [01:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=5964) new select list model does movies id and title and what is the id and title

- [01:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=6015) let's see obscured level is cyclist group

- [01:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=6023) four stamp fight club their values and display takes are

- [01:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=6032) reversed so this will be value this will be text and about group

- [01:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=6036) this will be text and about group we have a problem maybe i don't need to

- [01:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=6039) we have a problem maybe i don't need to provide that

- [01:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=6042) provide that so let's try without providing that

- [01:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=6047) so let's try without providing that maybe it will automatically arrive but

- [01:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=6049) maybe it will automatically arrive but i'm not sure

- [01:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=6057) let's move so yes let's try like this

- [01:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=6064) yes let's try like this i don't know if pull open will not bark

- [01:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=6066) i don't know if pull open will not bark or not

- [01:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=6090) okay now items are here but not the group

- [01:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=6091) group okay so what is left

- [01:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=6094) okay so what is left is

- [01:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=6139) okay addresses no no

- [01:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=6157) so address states addressed is

- [01:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=6160) addressed is coming from

- [01:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=6183) the other state is the group name so we need to provide

- [01:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=6202) so we just need to provide group as i writing no

- [01:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=6210) and then data group field like this let's see what happens

- [01:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=6252) no the group is still not working we have a problem with group

- [01:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=6255) have a problem with group group name oh

- [01:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=6293) yeah why not using group would say this item instead of

- [01:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=6295) item instead of group so let's modify

- [01:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=6299) group so let's modify our model s

- [01:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=6316) groups okay we are miss typing

- [01:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=6331) yeah there is no such thing so this is the library yeah this is

- [01:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=6334) so this is the library yeah this is something else

- [01:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=6335) something else okay someone else also asked this

- [01:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=6396) okay so many people have asked our question but

- [01:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=6397) question but there is another

- [01:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=6400) there is another good oh this is the order that we have

- [01:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=6402) good oh this is the order that we have to provide

- [01:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=6643) okay data group field user domestic group property corresponding selected

- [01:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=6645) group property corresponding selected list item

- [01:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=6655) so why it is not working let's put a breakpoint here to

- [01:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=6659) working let's put a breakpoint here to see what kind of data we are getting

- [01:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=6666) group action group these groups are not visible perhaps

- [01:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=6698) okay so in our movies list we have four select list item

- [01:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=6700) select list item oh i see we need to get

- [01:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=6704) oh i see we need to get group name not the group itself as you

- [01:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=6708) group name not the group itself as you can see

- [01:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=6709) can see because group has disabled and name

- [01:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=6728) group that name i wonder if that would work

- [01:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=6739) probably it wouldn't work but uh now i know the reason is for that let's

- [01:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=6742) now i know the reason is for that let's say mvc

- [01:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=6743) say mvc group name select next

- [01:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=6750) group name select next we need to group by name

- [01:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=6781) we need to game get name property group okay now working yes we have sold it

- [01:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=6785) okay now working yes we have sold it ourselves

- [01:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=6786) ourselves now you see there are groups as you can

- [01:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=6789) now you see there are groups as you can see

- [01:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=6791) see and when i send data back

- [01:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=6794) and when i send data back i should be able to get selected

- [01:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=6798) i should be able to get selected item fields let's try matrix

- [01:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=6802) item fields let's try matrix for example from our

- [01:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=6807) for example from our model let's see here and

- [01:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=6810) model let's see here and [Music]

- [01:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=6811) [Music] our selected movie here's oh our

- [01:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=6814) our selected movie here's oh our selected movie is no

- [01:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=6829) let's see the values you can select the movie optical

- [01:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=6831) you can select the movie optical playable

- [01:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=6833) playable oh the

- [01:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=6836) oh the so this is sending back the values of

- [01:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=6839) so this is sending back the values of the

- [01:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=6840) the uh selected item therefore

- [01:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=6843) uh selected item therefore uh it didn't work so it code behind i

- [01:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=6848) uh it didn't work so it code behind i have to get the movie id

- [01:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=6851) have to get the movie id and therefore let me fix that as well so

- [01:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=6855) and therefore let me fix that as well so we have values as text so it will be

- [01:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=6858) we have values as text so it will be string selected movie

- [01:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=6862) string selected movie id yeah now it will work

- [01:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=6865) id yeah now it will work so we will be able to get selected movie

- [01:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=6868) so we will be able to get selected movie id

- [01:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=6877) okay let's note that okay after build a opt-group

- [01:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=6910) okay and let's check matrix

- [01:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=6917) and on our model yes we are getting okay it's working great

- [01:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=6926) all right now that we have achieved how to

- [01:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=6927) to use group selected items

- [01:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=6931) use group selected items now we will continue with working with

- [01:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=6934) now we will continue with working with multiple selection lists

- [01:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=6936) multiple selection lists all right working with multiple

- [01:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=6940) all right working with multiple selection lists

- [01:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=6942) selection lists in some situations you want the end user

- [01:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=6944) in some situations you want the end user to be able to select

- [01:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=6945) to be able to select more than one item from the list at the

- [01:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=6947) more than one item from the list at the same time

- [01:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=6949) same time this is not possible in a drop down list

- [01:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=6951) this is not possible in a drop down list which is the default rendering of the

- [01:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=6953) which is the default rendering of the html select element

- [01:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=6955) html select element but it is in fact supported if you use

- [01:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=6958) but it is in fact supported if you use the multiple attribute

- [01:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=6959) the multiple attribute your select tag will be rendered as a

- [01:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=6961) your select tag will be rendered as a list box instead of a drop down list

- [01:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=6963) list box instead of a drop down list allowing you to select multiple items

- [01:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=6967) allowing you to select multiple items fortunately for us the select tag helper

- [01:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=6969) fortunately for us the select tag helper supports this as well in fact

- [01:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=6971) supports this as well in fact it will automatically use a multiple

- [01:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=6973) it will automatically use a multiple selection list if the property used in

- [01:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=6975) selection list if the property used in the asp for attribute is of the type

- [01:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=6977) the asp for attribute is of the type innumerable

- [01:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=6978) innumerable eg a list here's an example of a view

- [01:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=6981) eg a list here's an example of a view model which will deliver a set of movies

- [01:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=6983) model which will deliver a set of movies to the view

- [01:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=6984) to the view while accepting multiple selections in

- [01:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=6986) while accepting multiple selections in the favorite movie ids property

- [01:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=6988) the favorite movie ids property let's see where is the tag put

- [01:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=6998) select this and there is the multiple i attribute i think it is automatically

- [01:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=7001) attribute i think it is automatically adding a

- [01:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=7002) adding a multiple attribute if our target is

- [01:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=7007) multiple attribute if our target is ian variable and so let's

- [01:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=7011) ian variable and so let's define a variable like that

- [01:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=7016) define a variable like that public list string

- [01:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=7019) public list string is selected movie items

- [01:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=7023) is selected movie items or ids

- [01:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=7030) get and set all right and now

- [01:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=7034) and now let's duplicate our code on

- [01:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=7047) so here basically i will add another selection and this selected movie ids

- [01:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=7051) selection and this selected movie ids okay now it should be automatically

- [01:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=7053) okay now it should be automatically become

- [01:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=7054) become multiple selection so we will see

- [01:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=7075) you see select tag is extremely useful and important tag

- [01:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=7077) and important tag in web programming

- [01:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=7101) okay my computer is a little bit slow unfortunately okay now you see these

- [01:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=7103) unfortunately okay now you see these bars are regular select box

- [01:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=7105) bars are regular select box as you can see and this is the list box

- [01:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=7110) as you can see and this is the list box okay uh we can of course

- [01:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=7113) okay uh we can of course change how they look easily

- [01:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=7117) change how they look easily with using classes

- [01:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=7120) with using classes or writing in line css code

- [01:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=7125) or writing in line css code if we didn't start

- [01:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=7128) if we didn't start bootstrap however bootstrap have a lot

- [01:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=7130) bootstrap however bootstrap have a lot of classes to

- [01:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=7132) of classes to change how these elements are displayed

- [01:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=7136) change how these elements are displayed now i can oh still like oh i can now

- [01:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=7140) now i can oh still like oh i can now pick

- [01:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=7141) pick multiple elements with my mouse like

- [01:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=7143) multiple elements with my mouse like this

- [01:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=7144) this or with control hitting a control button

- [01:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=7148) or with control hitting a control button like this so i will pick matrix and

- [01:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=7151) like this so i will pick matrix and fight club

- [01:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=7153) fight club you see and let's see if it is uh

- [01:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=7157) you see and let's see if it is uh selected in my list in my movie ids list

- [01:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=7162) selected in my list in my movie ids list [Music]

- [01:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=7163) [Music] property okay as you can see

- [01:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=7166) property okay as you can see number id 2 and 3 is selected and

- [01:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=7170) number id 2 and 3 is selected and it is correct

- [01:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=7173) it is correct so i only changed the target

- [01:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=7181) target attribute of the [Music]

- [01:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=7183) [Music] html tag helper

- [01:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=7187) html tag helper and this attack helper and

- [01:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=7189) and this attack helper and automatically.net framework understood

- [01:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=7191) automatically.net framework understood that

- [01:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=7193) that now i am targeting an an enumerable

- [01:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=7196) now i am targeting an an enumerable object such as a list therefore it will

- [01:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=7199) object such as a list therefore it will be a collection of cell

- [02:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=7203) a collection of cell selections therefore it has

- [02:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=7206) selections therefore it has automatically parsed

- [02:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=7208) automatically parsed my select

- [02:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=7213) my select items as a list box let's also see how

- [02:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=7216) items as a list box let's also see how it is

- [02:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=7217) it is done in the source code as well and

- [02:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=7219) done in the source code as well and let's read the summary meanwhile

- [02:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=7225) let's read the summary meanwhile summary the html select element is one

- [02:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=7230) summary the html select element is one of the more complex html elements

- [02:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=7233) of the more complex html elements with lots of possibilities which is why

- [02:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=7235) with lots of possibilities which is why the select tag helper is also a bit more

- [02:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=7237) the select tag helper is also a bit more complex to use as seen in the examples

- [02:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=7239) complex to use as seen in the examples above

- [02:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=7241) above however that also means that it can save

- [02:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=7243) however that also means that it can save you even more time than usual

- [02:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=7245) you even more time than usual yes uh definitely

- [02:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=7248) yes uh definitely let's move to the next tutorial

- [02:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=7254) let's move to the next tutorial okay let's also check the source code

- [02:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=7257) okay let's also check the source code so when i click inspect now i am seeing

- [02:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=7260) so when i click inspect now i am seeing multiple attributes

- [02:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=7261) multiple attributes here as you can see

- [02:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=7268) and we still have opt group and option

- [02:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=7270) we still have opt group and option values and

- [02:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=7272) values and it also has now before attribute

- [02:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=7276) it also has now before attribute okay now we understand

- [02:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=7280) okay now we understand talk helpers let's continue with the

- [02:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=7282) talk helpers let's continue with the anchor talk

- [02:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=7292) the anchor tag helper the anchor tag helper can aid you when you want to link

- [02:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=7293) helper can aid you when you want to link to various actions on your controllers

- [02:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=7296) to various actions on your controllers you can of course do this manually with

- [02:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=7298) you can of course do this manually with regular html anchor elements and the ref

- [02:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=7301) regular html anchor elements and the ref attribute

- [02:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=7301) attribute but when you use the anchor tag helper

- [02:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=7304) but when you use the anchor tag helper the ref attribute will be automatically

- [02:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=7305) the ref attribute will be automatically generated for you

- [02:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=7308) generated for you the controller and action attributes

- [02:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=7311) the controller and action attributes the most commonly used attributes of

- [02:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=7313) the most commonly used attributes of this tag helper is the controller and

- [02:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=7315) this tag helper is the controller and action attributes

- [02:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=7317) action attributes as the names indicate they will allow

- [02:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=7319) as the names indicate they will allow you to reference which action on which

- [02:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=7320) you to reference which action on which controller you want the link to refer to

- [02:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=7323) controller you want the link to refer to so let's say you have a controller

- [02:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=7325) so let's say you have a controller called movie controller with an action

- [02:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=7327) called movie controller with an action method called list

- [02:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=7328) method called list for displaying a list of movies

- [02:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=7331) for displaying a list of movies generating a link for it with the anchor

- [02:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=7332) generating a link for it with the anchor tag helper would then look like this

- [02:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=7335) tag helper would then look like this a asp controller equals movie asp action

- [02:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=7339) a asp controller equals movie asp action equals list movie list slash a

- [02:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=7342) equals list movie list slash a the resulting html will look like this

- [02:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=7346) the resulting html will look like this a ref equals movie slash list movie list

- [02:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=7349) a ref equals movie slash list movie list slash a

- [02:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=7351) slash a notice that i use both attributes

- [02:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=7353) notice that i use both attributes controller in action

- [02:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=7354) controller in action if you don't asp.net will make

- [02:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=7357) if you don't asp.net will make assumptions about which controller or

- [02:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=7358) assumptions about which controller or action you want to use

- [02:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=7360) action you want to use based on the calling controller slash

- [02:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=7361) based on the calling controller slash action

- [02:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=7363) action in most situations you are better off

- [02:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=7365) in most situations you are better off specifying both attributes

- [02:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=7366) specifying both attributes okay so in most situations we should uh

- [02:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=7369) okay so in most situations we should uh define both of the

- [02:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=7375) parameters so let's add a [Music]

- [02:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=7378) [Music] let's add an anchor here

- [02:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=7382) let's add an anchor here for example

- [02:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=7394) okay a um area is controller action okay

- [02:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=7398) area is controller action okay controller controller will be lecture

- [02:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=7401) controller controller will be lecture seven

- [02:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=7402) seven it is not auto

- [02:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=7409) uh lecture seven and the action will be let's

- [02:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=7410) let's define an action from the lecture seven

- [02:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=7413) define an action from the lecture seven such as okay this is

- [02:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=7417) such as okay this is http post this is get

- [02:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=7421) http post this is get let's add let's write an action to here

- [02:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=7424) let's add let's write an action to here such as

- [02:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=7437) okay list stop action and this will

- [02:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=7441) list stop action and this will return contents

- [02:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=7451) return contents yeah content

- [02:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=7462) okay sound volumes whatever we want and now

- [02:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=7465) and now i'm also telling action to this and you

- [02:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=7468) i'm also telling action to this and you see this is regular html

- [02:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=7471) see this is regular html and it is enriched with a aspect of

- [02:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=7474) and it is enriched with a aspect of culture so

- [02:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=7475) culture so let's define the link name

- [02:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=7479) let's define the link name return some stuff from lecture

- [02:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=7482) return some stuff from lecture seven now let's run it and continue

- [02:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=7492) reading the root dash value attribute

- [02:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=7498) in the example above we link to a list of movies but the anchor tag helper is

- [02:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=7500) of movies but the anchor tag helper is perhaps even more useful when you want

- [02:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=7502) perhaps even more useful when you want to link to a specific object in our

- [02:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=7504) to link to a specific object in our example

- [02:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=7505) example a specific movie so when the list action

- [02:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=7508) a specific movie so when the list action is called

- [02:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=7508) is called you would return a list of movies as in

- [02:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=7510) you would return a list of movies as in this example

- [02:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=7513) this example okay

- [02:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=7518) in the list view you would then iterate over the movies and output a link to

- [02:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=7520) over the movies and output a link to details about each of them

- [02:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=7522) details about each of them okay this is

- [02:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=7525) okay this is this is just regular thing

- [02:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=7528) this is just regular thing so let's continue

- [02:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=7532) so let's continue pay special attention to the last

- [02:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=7533) pay special attention to the last attribute oh i see

- [02:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=7535) attribute oh i see i see now i think this is important

- [02:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=7539) i see now i think this is important let's make

- [02:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=7539) let's make example of this as well so here now we

- [02:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=7542) example of this as well so here now we can see our generated

- [02:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=7548) link you see it is linking to lecture seven however the action is failed

- [02:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=7551) seven however the action is failed obviously when we click it

- [02:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=7560) yeah action is failed it didn't work as we wanted

- [02:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=7561) we wanted action this stuff oh because this will

- [02:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=7563) action this stuff oh because this will be asp action

- [02:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=7565) be asp action not just action all right

- [02:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=7569) not just action all right let's restart and

- [02:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=7573) let's restart and now i will make an example of asv root

- [02:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=7576) now i will make an example of asv root id attribute

- [02:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=7585) to display you a better thing so let's go to our

- [02:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=7588) a better thing so let's go to our lecture 10

- [02:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=7589) lecture 10 model and in our lecture time

- [02:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=7593) model and in our lecture time model what do we have

- [02:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=7597) model what do we have we have movie list yeah

- [02:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=7601) we have movie list yeah and the mobile list is

- [02:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=7605) and the mobile list is a selected item list

- [02:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=7619) okay i think can i iterate yeah i can i think iterate

- [02:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=7623) can i iterate yeah i can i think iterate through this list as well so it should

- [02:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=7625) through this list as well so it should work

- [02:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=7627) work okay now when i inspect

- [02:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=7631) okay now when i inspect i can't see no

- [02:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=7634) i can't see no it didn't work either so you see here

- [02:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=7638) it didn't work either so you see here is empty by

- [02:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=7641) is empty by public action results

- [02:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=7647) public action results list stop

- [02:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=7660) maybe it is not a sv action but it is yeah it's

- [02:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=7661) yeah it's the extra action list

- [02:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=7675) the extra action list why this is not working

- [02:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=7685) maybe because we are having a route here i don't know

- [02:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=7687) i don't know it doesn't make sense

- [02:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=7697) let's add an action name maybe it will work

- [02:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=7717) okay so action name is working like this probably here

- [02:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=7730) and yeah now it should work let's try again

- [02:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=7734) yeah now it should work let's try again expo controller lecture seven yeah

- [02:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=7737) expo controller lecture seven yeah lecture seven

- [02:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=7738) lecture seven controller exists

- [02:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=7747) and action name is also exists first let's fix it and we will continue

- [02:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=7751) first let's fix it and we will continue for

- [02:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=7751) for road id attribute

- [02:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=7781) i think we have also encountered this problem

- [02:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=7783) problem in our previous lectures but

- [02:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=7786) in our previous lectures but what was the reason

- [02:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=7842) maybe uh action result and i action result

- [02:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=7845) uh action result and i action result maybe this is the reason

- [02:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=7847) maybe this is the reason so i don't know

- [02:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=7965) this is lecture seven controller yeah we have the exact naming and

- [02:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=7968) have the exact naming and [Music]

- [02:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=7970) [Music] i will pause find it

- [02:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=7978) okay i have figured out the problem and now i will explain it to you so how did i do

- [02:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=7981) i will explain it to you so how did i do that

- [02:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=7982) that first i have checked whether that

- [02:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=7985) first i have checked whether that action is working or not

- [02:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=7989) action is working or not through browser okay so not

- [02:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=7993) through browser okay so not i didn't focus on the

- [02:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=7996) i didn't focus on the code here and first i verified that

- [02:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=7999) code here and first i verified that whether our uh lecture seven

- [02:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8004) whether our uh lecture seven uh list stack actually is working or not

- [02:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8008) uh list stack actually is working or not okay so lecture seven

- [02:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8011) okay so lecture seven this stuff and

- [02:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8015) this stuff and as we are going to see right now it uh

- [02:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8017) as we are going to see right now it uh it is returning to

- [02:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8019) it is returning to lecture seven index do you know why

- [02:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8024) lecture seven index do you know why because right now

- [02:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8027) because right now this is overriding or

- [02:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8031) this is overriding or let's say catching all the

- [02:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8040) routing and because it is a expecting a user id and working as http

- [02:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8044) expecting a user id and working as http get therefore it is getting all the

- [02:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8048) get therefore it is getting all the routing id okay so

- [02:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8052) routing id okay so uh moreover uh i also tried with

- [02:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8056) uh moreover uh i also tried with lectures eight uh method

- [02:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8060) lectures eight uh method here like you see it also

- [02:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8063) here like you see it also this stuff so let's make this lecture

- [02:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8066) this stuff so let's make this lecture eight and in nature eight controller we

- [02:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8068) eight and in nature eight controller we don't have such routing

- [02:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8070) don't have such routing therefore it should work right and no it

- [02:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8073) therefore it should work right and no it doesn't work

- [02:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8073) doesn't work do you know why because our current our

- [02:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8076) do you know why because our current our routing is not

- [02:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8077) routing is not working and the reason is in our

- [02:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8081) working and the reason is in our uh startup cs

- [02:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8084) uh startup cs we have started our mvc with

- [02:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8088) we have started our mvc with enable endpoint routing false okay so we

- [02:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8091) enable endpoint routing false okay so we have

- [02:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8092) have several options to fix this

- [02:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8095) several options to fix this first of all we can make this true okay

- [02:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8100) first of all we can make this true okay however if we make this true then we

- [02:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8102) however if we make this true then we can't use

- [02:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8104) can't use this routing you see it says it says

- [02:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8107) this routing you see it says it says that using use mvc to configure

- [02:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8109) that using use mvc to configure mvc is not supported while using

- [02:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8112) mvc is not supported while using endpoint routing

- [02:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8113) endpoint routing to continue using use mvc please set

- [02:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8115) to continue using use mvc please set missile options enabled

- [02:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8117) missile options enabled routing force personally i don't suggest

- [02:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8121) routing force personally i don't suggest you to use this method this is not the

- [02:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8125) you to use this method this is not the proper way

- [02:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8126) proper way therefore i am going to comment that out

- [02:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8128) therefore i am going to comment that out and enable

- [02:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8130) and enable and points default routing

- [02:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8134) and points default routing so this enables us to

- [02:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8137) so this enables us to use the routing uh that is by default

- [02:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8141) use the routing uh that is by default and that you will most likely to find

- [02:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8144) and that you will most likely to find on the internet what i mean is when you

- [02:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8146) on the internet what i mean is when you search for how to do routing

- [02:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8148) search for how to do routing you will find examples based on

- [02:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8151) you will find examples based on using the uh use endpoints rooting

- [02:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8154) using the uh use endpoints rooting strategy

- [02:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8155) strategy not this one so this is a better one

- [02:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8159) not this one so this is a better one so now let's try lecture eight

- [02:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8164) so now let's try lecture eight and this stuff now it is working because

- [02:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8167) and this stuff now it is working because now it is using the

- [02:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8169) now it is using the proper way and what about list 7 now it

- [02:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8172) proper way and what about list 7 now it is also working

- [02:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8173) is also working so right now this

- [02:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8177) so right now this is not uh

- [02:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8181) is not uh overridden by the uh this one

- [02:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8184) overridden by the uh this one so what happens if i because its order

- [02:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8186) so what happens if i because its order is true

- [02:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8187) is true what happens if i put a

- [02:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8192) what happens if i put a value is something like this then it

- [02:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8195) value is something like this then it doesn't work

- [02:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8196) doesn't work and this is uh this has probably

- [02:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8206) and this is uh this has probably it our root way how it works

- [02:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8210) it our root way how it works so can we make this work uh still

- [02:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8217) let me check that so this is optional user id parameters

- [02:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8220) user id parameters and when we do it like this

- [02:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8230) okay it is working however the user id is not

- [02:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8234) is not okay oh it is still working and when we

- [02:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8237) okay oh it is still working and when we make it something like this

- [02:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8239) make it something like this yeah working so why didn't it work let

- [02:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8242) yeah working so why didn't it work let me make it like this oh it's still

- [02:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8243) me make it like this oh it's still working

- [02:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8245) working okay so both are working and default

- [02:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8248) okay so both are working and default routing is also working another way

- [02:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8251) is also working another way would be defining our

- [02:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8255) would be defining our custom route to access that such as

- [02:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8267) um let's make this as list some

- [02:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8270) as list some stuff okay so when i make it like this

- [02:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8274) stuff okay so when i make it like this i can directly give

- [02:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8278) i can directly give a link to it

- [02:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8281) a link to it like i think

- [02:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8291) there was a way we were able to name the root

- [02:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8292) root so i'm going to name the root as name

- [02:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8297) so i'm going to name the root as name like um okay

- [02:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8304) with some stuff okay now it should work so this is the routing name and this is

- [02:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8305) so this is the routing name and this is the routing address and

- [02:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8309) the routing address and the instead of asv action controller i'm

- [02:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8311) the instead of asv action controller i'm going to use asv

- [02:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8313) going to use asv root and i just will give the root name

- [02:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8316) root and i just will give the root name this would also work with the previous

- [02:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8319) this would also work with the previous uh

- [02:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8319) uh version as well where we have disabled

- [02:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8323) version as well where we have disabled the and your default endpoint routing

- [02:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8326) the and your default endpoint routing so you see you have a lot of options to

- [02:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8328) so you see you have a lot of options to work with

- [02:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8329) work with either they can work however i would uh

- [02:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8332) either they can work however i would uh i

- [02:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8333) i i suggest you to use use endpoint

- [02:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8336) i suggest you to use use endpoint default routing

- [02:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8337) default routing because i think it is better and now

- [02:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8342) because i think it is better and now let's check the link here

- [02:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8347) let's check the link here okay so you see both of them are going

- [02:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8350) okay so you see both of them are going to these roots

- [02:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8352) to these roots and this root is the root that

- [02:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8355) and this root is the root that we have defined here okay

- [02:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8359) we have defined here okay and what the default way work default

- [02:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8362) and what the default way work default action name

- [02:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8362) action name by the way the action name is right now

- [02:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8364) by the way the action name is right now hidden from the user

- [02:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8366) hidden from the user uh because we are using a custom root

- [02:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8368) uh because we are using a custom root name

- [02:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8369) name and yes default root name not working

- [02:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8372) and yes default root name not working anymore

- [02:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8374) anymore so we have to use this routing pay

- [02:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8378) so we have to use this routing pay and now it is working okay so these are

- [02:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8381) and now it is working okay so these are the options this is how we

- [02:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8383) the options this is how we solve it and now

- [02:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8387) solve it and now i am going to show you uh the root id

- [02:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8391) i am going to show you uh the root id parameter

- [02:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8391) parameter okay so let's

- [02:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8399) write another action here public i action results

- [02:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8402) public i action results okay and

- [02:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8405) okay and let's say list movie details

- [02:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8414) okay so this is going to take a parameter

- [02:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8415) parameter a root id parameter okay it is also

- [02:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8418) a root id parameter okay it is also explained in our

- [02:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8427) [Music] example okay and so

- [02:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8432) example okay and so do we need to type here's exact name

- [02:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8434) do we need to type here's exact name probably yes

- [02:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8437) probably yes ir move id okay something like this

- [02:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8441) ir move id okay something like this and what this is going to do is so

- [02:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8450) it will return from the model however we need to have the default

- [02:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8452) however we need to have the default model for that

- [02:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8454) model for that so let's generate our model

- [02:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8463) okay we can just initialize it like this and we will return my model that

- [02:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8467) and we will return my model that list selected movie id select

- [02:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8478) [Music] is the anything name it is like

- [02:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8480) is the anything name it is like parameters

- [02:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8482) parameters and here okay

- [02:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8485) and here okay so by the way not the selected movie

- [02:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8487) so by the way not the selected movie this we need to use

- [02:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8493) okay where is it i think it is inside movie list

- [02:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8495) movie list mobile list is a list of selected list

- [02:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8498) mobile list is a list of selected list item

- [02:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8499) item no

- [02:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8505) let's go to our model i think we can even see from here

- [02:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8508) even see from here like peak definition

- [02:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8512) like peak definition and here where do we set it

- [02:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8525) okay selected list group then we add them into the movie list yeah inside mobile

- [02:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8529) into the movie list yeah inside mobile list okay

- [02:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8536) okay pr dot movie lists

- [02:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8543) movie lists why it is not okay

- [02:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8552) i think it will be from here my mobile list okay and there appear dots

- [02:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8556) okay and there appear dots um value equal to

- [02:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8569) and then it says sync an integer therefore i am going to make this

- [02:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8571) therefore i am going to make this um to string

- [02:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8574) um to string actually we can even directly take a

- [02:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8576) actually we can even directly take a string

- [02:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8583) it doesn't matter and then we are going to select

- [02:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8586) then we are going to select the name of the movie

- [02:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8600) okay so the value selected text yeah and of course we can not just return

- [02:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8603) and of course we can not just return we need to return as content and

- [02:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8606) we need to return as content and this will be our string

- [02:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8614) however i also need to make it default or

- [02:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8615) or empty first or default yeah let's make

- [02:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8618) empty first or default yeah let's make it first of default

- [02:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8621) it first of default first or default i think

- [02:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8627) first or default i think now since it is first of default we need

- [02:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8630) now since it is first of default we need to perhaps use

- [02:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8631) to perhaps use milkshake or

- [02:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8637) okay since this is first or default we can probably

- [02:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8638) can probably get text directly okay so this

- [02:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8642) get text directly okay so this can be null as well because if that's

- [02:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8646) can be null as well because if that's my value is not existing

- [02:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8649) my value is not existing so we can make a new check like

- [02:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8652) so we can make a new check like if it is new we will return

- [02:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8656) if it is new we will return no such movie is font

- [02:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8660) no such movie is font else we will return the value itself

- [02:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8664) else we will return the value itself um

- [02:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8669) i wonder if there is something like this yeah let's try it

- [02:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8671) yeah let's try it okay so this will be the list movie

- [02:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8672) okay so this will be the list movie details

- [02:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8674) details and now let's code uh our cs html so

- [02:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8678) and now let's code uh our cs html so inside here

- [02:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8680) inside here i'm going to have a for each statement

- [02:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8682) i'm going to have a for each statement which will be inside

- [02:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8684) which will be inside model dot

- [02:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8687) model dot um [Music]

- [02:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8691) [Music] a movie list and from here i will use

- [02:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8694) a movie list and from here i will use select select

- [02:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8700) pr that [Music]

- [02:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8710) i think i just i can directly iterate it okay we are moving

- [02:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8718) and let's write

- [02:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8729) okay so the controller will be lecture 10

- [02:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8731) 10 and the action will be list movie

- [02:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8733) and the action will be list movie details

- [02:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8736) details and then we are going to set a root id

- [02:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8739) and then we are going to set a root id sp root

- [02:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8743) sp root id or i think

- [02:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8747) id or i think this let me check it

- [02:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8752) this let me check it yes we root and instead of id we are

- [02:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8755) yes we root and instead of id we are going to use

- [02:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8757) going to use sr movie id like this

- [02:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8765) will be equal to x vr per movie dot

- [02:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8768) vr per movie dot oh so when we set it as var

- [02:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8771) oh so when we set it as var it cannot see it therefore i need to set

- [02:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8774) it cannot see it therefore i need to set it as

- [02:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8781) lecture nine dot models that lecture 10 dot okay

- [02:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8785) lecture 10 dot okay it's not visible here so not this but

- [02:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8790) it's not visible here so not this but selected item list so the selected item

- [02:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8793) selected item list so the selected item list is

- [02:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8795) list is let's check our controller it is coming

- [02:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8799) let's check our controller it is coming from

- [02:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8801) from um

- [02:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8808) and we see rendering yeah so it's coming from and we say rendering

- [02:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8815) let's see if it will oh it's directly visible

- [02:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8816) visible now i can see you see the set

- [02:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8819) now i can see you see the set text not text of course it will be id

- [02:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8823) text not text of course it will be id value i need so this will be the uh

- [02:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8826) value i need so this will be the uh so basically we will provide this action

- [02:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8830) so basically we will provide this action the id of the movie so that we can

- [02:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8832) the id of the movie so that we can return its

- [02:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8834) return its value click here

- [02:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8844) to find out this movie name okay uh it will be something like

- [02:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8848) okay uh it will be something like um random

- [02:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8851) um random okay so let's also put a breakpoint here

- [02:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8854) okay so let's also put a breakpoint here to see what happens in the code behind

- [02:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8862) [Music] okay

- [02:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8864) okay all right let's run the application

- [02:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8888) all right so you see sr movie id1

- [02:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8891) you see sr movie id1 sr movie id2 these are the links

- [02:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8895) sr movie id2 these are the links when i inspect i can see the

- [02:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8898) when i inspect i can see the generated values however

- [02:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8902) generated values however you see right now it is it starts with

- [02:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8905) you see right now it is it starts with slash because we are on the same

- [02:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8909) slash because we are on the same page right now we are on the controller

- [02:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8911) page right now we are on the controller 10 therefore

- [02:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8913) 10 therefore when i click each of them it will uh

- [02:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8917) when i click each of them it will uh return the value oh it is not returning

- [02:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8919) return the value oh it is not returning because

- [02:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8924) yeah the action is not working here that is why

- [02:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8926) is why so let's check our

- [02:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8935) codes here we are we have default route we have root update name

- [02:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8939) we have root update name and we have the action name okay

- [02:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8947) so in our next chat off

- [02:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8970) additional parameters for the roots also since we are using root

- [02:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8972) since we are using root what this is to still work it should so

- [02:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=8989) let's define a custom rod instead of this

- [02:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=9005) okay lectures 10 oh yeah details and the road name will

- [02:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=9009) oh yeah details and the road name will be

- [02:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=9020) okay so the road name will be yeah i will just make it like this

- [02:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=9023) will just make it like this okay and can be this over

- [02:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=9026) okay and can be this over rhythm with the default route

- [02:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=9037) change our code as as we root

- [02:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=9041) as we root just this here let's try this way

- [02:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=9052) okay so by default mode it didn't work probably because we have

- [02:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=9054) probably because we have a route routing at the top

- [02:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=9058) a route routing at the top and then

- [02:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=9067) yeah here so this default routing could have been causing some problems

- [02:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=9070) could have been causing some problems maybe oh i know i know there is i know

- [02:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=9073) maybe oh i know i know there is i know the reason

- [02:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=9088) let me check something lectures oh impressing

- [02:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=9103) then we can look for the alternative way as well

- [02:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=9117) control the movie action details okay let's look at the links okay now

- [02:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=9119) okay let's look at the links okay now the links are

- [02:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=9121) the links are generated as we wanted the movie id

- [02:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=9124) generated as we wanted the movie id has returned successfully okay

- [02:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=9131) and let's see the results but the content is

- [02:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=9132) content is not return it

- [02:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=9136) not return it so first

- [02:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=9144) let's see what does this return so we can debug debugging

- [02:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=9147) so we can debug debugging we can do a debug on that

- [02:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=9159) we can do a debug on that once we generate an instance of lecture

- [02:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=9161) once we generate an instance of lecture 10 model

- [02:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=9162) 10 model it should automatically initialize

- [02:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=9165) it should automatically initialize the movie movies list because we are

- [02:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=9168) the movie movies list because we are initializing it

- [02:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=9169) initializing it inside the constructor here

- [02:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=9172) inside the constructor here you see this is the constructors and we

- [02:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=9176) you see this is the constructors and we are initializing the list

- [02:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=9179) are initializing the list so that is the problem let's find out

- [02:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=9183) so that is the problem let's find out okay the movie id is here

- [02:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=9187) okay the movie id is here value is here

- [02:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=9190) value is here and

- [02:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=9196) i think the default value is the problem yeah

- [02:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=9198) yeah so let's make it like this

- [02:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=9201) so let's make it like this okay citrine

- [02:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=9202) okay citrine [Music]

- [02:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=9210) is new or empty equal to actually i can even make it like this

- [02:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=9223) no okay then no such movie is found

- [02:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=9227) no such movie is found else the valley itself so the default

- [02:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=9230) else the valley itself so the default was rather wrong i think

- [02:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=9234) rather wrong i think it was default string probably

- [02:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=9237) it was default string probably so let's just return it like this yeah

- [02:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=9240) so let's just return it like this yeah now it should work

- [02:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=9242) now it should work as expected

- [02:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=9277) okay and yes as you can see now we are seeing the

- [02:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=9280) as you can see now we are seeing the names and let's enter something not

- [02:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=9283) names and let's enter something not exist in the movie list okay no such

- [02:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=9286) exist in the movie list okay no such movie is

- [02:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=9286) movie is found so you see this can be used

- [02:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=9289) found so you see this can be used uh basically for anything you can do an

- [02:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=9293) uh basically for anything you can do an ajax query you can use this as a web

- [02:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=9296) ajax query you can use this as a web service

- [02:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=9303) as with get methods and it is working as we wanted but this is not

- [02:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=9306) as we wanted but this is not very much seo friendly this is not seo

- [02:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=9311) very much seo friendly this is not seo friendly

- [02:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=9317) friendly url so i think we should be able to fix that

- [02:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=9320) i think we should be able to fix that as well so instead of root id

- [02:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=9325) as well so instead of root id let's add a parameter here optional

- [02:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=9329) let's add a parameter here optional parameter okay

- [02:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=9330) parameter okay like

- [02:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=9340) like this okay so now i am going to make a saf sao bradley

- [02:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=9345) make a saf sao bradley version as well so

- [02:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=9348) version as well so um we have

- [02:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=9383) post okay let me check

- [02:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=9397) instead of wrote id i wonder if there is another way

- [02:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=9427) and let's see attack helpers yeah we need to expand

- [02:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=9429) need to expand with helpers okay

- [02:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=9457) let's talk help yeah we need to look for this way

- [02:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=9497) i think i will just write it directly as read equal to

- [02:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=9501) directly as read equal to so what is the

- [02:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=9509) road it is like this it will be like this and for the

- [02:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=9510) this and for the movie id simply we will use

- [02:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=9514) movie id simply we will use a vr per

- [02:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=9517) a vr per movie that's

- [02:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=9528) so this will be more sao friendly uh version however here we are riding

- [02:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=9531) uh version however here we are riding the full path ourselves i don't know if

- [02:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=9534) the full path ourselves i don't know if we can add

- [02:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=9537) we can add optional parameter to asb root stack

- [02:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=9551) helper asp wrote id works but uh the other

- [02:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=9555) asp wrote id works but uh the other it is not sao friendly now when i

- [02:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=9558) it is not sao friendly now when i open this yes it is working and it is

- [02:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=9562) open this yes it is working and it is more sao apparently okay

- [02:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=9578) so if someone has asked this probably not okay it is not that

- [02:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=9579) probably not okay it is not that important either

- [02:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=9581) important either so let's see what's

- [02:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=9585) so let's see what's more we have done

- [02:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=9594) okay how to how to compose multiple static shin

- [02:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=9598) multiple static shin with muscle and selectable

- [02:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=9617) with using pack helpers and i

- [02:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=9620) and i label property

- [02:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=9624) label property binding okay

- [02:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=9635) binding okay on this select this yeah

- [02:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=9639) on this select this yeah okay and

- [02:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=9648) after compose seo okay how to use road

- [02:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=9652) how to use road time to get parameters from

- [02:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=9676) so there is also fragment like this this hashtag is used to directly

- [02:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=9680) this hashtag is used to directly move to a part of the page i will also

- [02:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=9683) move to a part of the page i will also show you that

- [02:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=9686) show you that in an example it may be also useful for

- [02:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=9690) in an example it may be also useful for you

- [02:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=9691) you okay so

- [02:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=9725) it's not generating sniper napkin what else

- [02:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=9732) what else compose

- [02:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=9754) all right let's also see [Music]

- [02:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=9756) [Music] fragments

- [02:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=9762) and how it works there is also protocol attribute

- [02:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=9765) attribute we can tell that the protocol will be

- [02:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=9768) we can tell that the protocol will be https

- [02:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=9770) https like this or http

- [02:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=9775) like this or http about fragments

- [02:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=9784) i think it was going to id or something yeah

- [02:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=9787) id or something yeah so to do that let's

- [02:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=9791) so to do that let's add something to yes

- [02:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=9802) i will make it as new id i want an example

- [02:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=9807) new id i want an example and let's add a button

- [02:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=9844) it is slash and then let's add fragments

- [02:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=9859) so the fractions will be [Music]

- [02:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=9872) by the way this is supposed to do a full uh page navigation and then go to the

- [02:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=9875) uh page navigation and then go to the fragment

- [02:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=9875) fragment not directly going to fragment bit

- [02:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=9879) not directly going to fragment bit java secrets but i am not sure we will

- [02:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=9881) java secrets but i am not sure we will see that

- [02:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=9886) see that okay so we have a text here and when i

- [02:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=9888) okay so we have a text here and when i click this

- [02:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=9891) click this okay it didn't work

- [02:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=9900) okay so the road of this

- [02:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=9914) okay bye this is the road

- [02:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=9936) we need to give it a name okay let's make the name

- [02:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=9937) make the name as this

- [02:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=9944) okay let's restart so you see to be able to access a route

- [02:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=9946) so you see to be able to access a route you need to give it a name

- [02:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=9967) okay this didn't work well we have an error somewhere

- [02:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=9971) error somewhere oh this is compiler let's redry

- [02:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=9985) let's close this page uh the compiled error happened because

- [02:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=9987) uh the compiled error happened because of the overriding the

- [02:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=9989) of the overriding the executing files that's rubber network

- [02:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=9993) executing files that's rubber network okay and now

- [02:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=9995) okay and now yes now it is working

- [02:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10002) okay but it is not redirecting it is just going to that link

- [02:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10005) just going to that link so if you make it something like this

- [02:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10010) so if you make it something like this you see it is directly going to that

- [02:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10012) you see it is directly going to that page so

- [02:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10014) page so it is not a right redirect but it is

- [02:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10017) it is not a right redirect but it is directly going to that page because we

- [02:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10019) directly going to that page because we have users

- [02:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10021) have users the same page linking like this

- [02:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10025) the same page linking like this so when i click it it directly goes to

- [02:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10028) so when i click it it directly goes to that picture okay it's working as well

- [02:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10031) that picture okay it's working as well so this is called as fragment attribute

- [02:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10041) all right and protocol attribute host attribute

- [02:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10042) attribute like this or you can also use host

- [02:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10045) like this or you can also use host attribute an

- [02:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10046) attribute an action

- [02:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10079) how to use fragment attribute okay host attribute

- [02:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10096) protocol attributes okay let's copy and paste this

- [02:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10100) okay let's copy and paste this to see what but this wouldn't work

- [02:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10102) to see what but this wouldn't work because

- [02:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10105) because maybe it was work i'm not sure

- [02:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10111) ah currently hosts this localhost so this may not work

- [02:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10118) yeah okay so in your website you can use this but i wouldn't suggest it

- [02:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10120) this but i wouldn't suggest it it should get the host itself

- [02:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10125) it should get the host itself automatically

- [02:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10143) all right and the next one is secret park helpers

- [02:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10147) secret park helpers yeah let's see that as well

- [02:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10157) the script tag helper historically script files usually javascript have

- [02:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10160) script files usually javascript have been hosted locally

- [02:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10161) been hosted locally along with the rest of the files used by

- [02:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10163) along with the rest of the files used by a web application

- [02:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10165) a web application however as early as the beginning of

- [02:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10167) however as early as the beginning of 2000 the concept of cdns became a very

- [02:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10170) 2000 the concept of cdns became a very popular alternative to hosting static

- [02:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10172) popular alternative to hosting static content like script files on the same

- [02:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10174) content like script files on the same server as the website

- [02:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10176) server as the website cdn is short for content delivery

- [02:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10178) cdn is short for content delivery network and while cdns are used for a

- [02:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10181) network and while cdns are used for a variety of purposes and reasons

- [02:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10183) variety of purposes and reasons our focus in this article is the

- [02:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10184) our focus in this article is the delivery of script files

- [02:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10187) delivery of script files if you use any of the large javascript

- [02:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10189) if you use any of the large javascript frameworks eg jquery

- [02:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10191) frameworks eg jquery you should consider using a cdn for

- [02:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10193) you should consider using a cdn for hosting and delivering it to your web

- [02:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10195) hosting and delivering it to your web application

- [02:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10197) application the biggest advantage besides the fact

- [02:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10199) the biggest advantage besides the fact that your server will save some

- [02:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10200) that your server will save some resources

- [02:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10201) resources is the fact that if you use a library

- [02:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10203) is the fact that if you use a library that is also used in other major sites

- [02:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10205) that is also used in other major sites the browser of the visitor is allowed to

- [02:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10207) the browser of the visitor is allowed to cache it and then reuse it when they

- [02:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10209) cache it and then reuse it when they visit your website this will make your

- [02:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10210) visit your website this will make your website seem much faster

- [02:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10212) website seem much faster while saving bandwidth and resources a

- [02:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10215) while saving bandwidth and resources a win-win situation

- [02:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10216) win-win situation what does this mean is for example when

- [02:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10219) what does this mean is for example when i visited

- [02:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10220) i visited this page my browser is caging

- [02:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10223) this page my browser is caging for example bootstrap means css

- [02:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10226) for example bootstrap means css it is coming from bootstrap cdn so if i

- [02:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10229) it is coming from bootstrap cdn so if i use this

- [02:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10230) use this css on my web page it won't get

- [02:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10233) css on my web page it won't get downloaded again because

- [02:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10237) downloaded again because the url will be same on my web page as

- [02:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10241) the url will be same on my web page as well therefore

- [02:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10241) well therefore the browser will check the cage and see

- [02:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10245) the browser will check the cage and see that this

- [02:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10246) that this url this file already exists in the cage

- [02:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10249) url this file already exists in the cage so both on my website on and on this

- [02:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10252) so both on my website on and on this website

- [02:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10254) website since we are using the same cdn

- [02:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10258) since we are using the same cdn for getting to css file of bootstrap

- [02:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10262) for getting to css file of bootstrap only on one website it will dedicate it

- [02:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10265) only on one website it will dedicate it and the other one will use that cage

- [02:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10267) and the other one will use that cage so it will be much faster it will save

- [02:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10270) so it will be much faster it will save resources

- [02:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10271) resources bandwidth and such it will improve your

- [02:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10273) bandwidth and such it will improve your score

- [02:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10274) score on the eyes of google or other search

- [02:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10277) on the eyes of google or other search engines and such

- [02:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10278) engines and such so this is what so this is what does

- [02:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10280) so this is what so this is what does this

- [02:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10282) this paragraph means the

- [02:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10285) paragraph means the perhaps only problem with using a cdn is

- [02:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10287) perhaps only problem with using a cdn is the fact that it might not be available

- [02:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10289) the fact that it might not be available 100

- [02:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10290) 100 of the time and this is true if cdn is

- [02:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10293) of the time and this is true if cdn is down then you would like

- [02:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10294) down then you would like to serve it from your website so

- [02:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10298) to serve it from your website so first check cdn and if it is not

- [02:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10301) first check cdn and if it is not available then use

- [02:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10302) available then use another cdn that i put or

- [02:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10306) another cdn that i put or use my website itself

- [02:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10313) time this is rarely a problem if you use one of the major cdns

- [02:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10314) one of the major cdns but everything breaks at some point and

- [02:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10317) but everything breaks at some point and when it does you will experience that

- [02:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10318) when it does you will experience that your website is online and apparently

- [02:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10321) your website is online and apparently working

- [02:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10321) working but some of the features are failing

- [02:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10323) but some of the features are failing because an important piece of javascript

- [02:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10325) because an important piece of javascript is no longer available to the rest of

- [02:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10326) is no longer available to the rest of your code

- [02:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10328) your code therefore you should always have a local

- [02:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10330) therefore you should always have a local fallback but how do you know when to use

- [02:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10332) fallback but how do you know when to use it

- [02:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10333) it this is where the script tag helper

- [02:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10334) this is where the script tag helper comes in

- [02:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10344) okay why use cd and bluehost static files

- [02:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10348) static files how to have a backup plan

- [02:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10351) how to have a backup plan of syria and payload

- [02:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10356) of syria and payload with okay for works cryptocurrency

- [02:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10377) the fallback src attribute to use the script tag helper you should

- [02:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10380) to use the script tag helper you should always supply a value for the fallback

- [02:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10382) always supply a value for the fallback src attribute

- [02:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10383) src attribute as an alternative to the regular src

- [02:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10385) as an alternative to the regular src attribute

- [02:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10387) attribute this is the path to the local file you

- [02:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10389) this is the path to the local file you want to use in case the cdn

- [02:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10390) want to use in case the cdn is not working as expected it could look

- [02:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10393) is not working as expected it could look like this

- [02:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10396) like this script src equals ht

- [02:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10403) in this case jquery will be loaded from the cdnjs

- [02:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10405) the cdnjs a very popular cdn location but if that

- [02:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10407) a very popular cdn location but if that doesn't work

- [02:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10408) doesn't work a local version will be requested from

- [02:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10410) a local version will be requested from the local content folder instead

- [02:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10413) the local content folder instead however detecting that the cdn has

- [02:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10415) however detecting that the cdn has failed to deliver the required

- [02:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10416) failed to deliver the required javascript file can be difficult

- [02:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10418) javascript file can be difficult but the script tag helper can help you

- [02:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10420) but the script tag helper can help you with this as well

- [02:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10423) with this as well so how will browser understand that this

- [02:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10425) so how will browser understand that this file is not

- [02:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10426) file is not existing that is that will be handled by

- [02:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10430) existing that is that will be handled by the uh

- [02:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10431) the uh [Music]

- [02:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10433) [Music] our script helper and let's see that as

- [02:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10437) our script helper and let's see that as well the fallback test attribute

- [02:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10440) well the fallback test attribute by supplying a value for the fallback

- [02:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10442) by supplying a value for the fallback test attribute

- [02:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10443) test attribute the script tag helper will make sure to

- [02:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10445) the script tag helper will make sure to output javascript code to test whether

- [02:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10447) output javascript code to test whether the desired library was loaded correctly

- [02:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10449) the desired library was loaded correctly and if not

- [02:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10450) and if not the local fallback script will be

- [02:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10452) the local fallback script will be included

- [02:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10453) included in the case of jquery you can take

- [02:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10455) in the case of jquery you can take advantage of the fact that jquery will

- [02:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10457) advantage of the fact that jquery will attach itself as a property on the

- [02:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10459) attach itself as a property on the global window object

- [02:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10461) global window object meaning that if jquery has been

- [02:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10462) meaning that if jquery has been successfully loaded you can access

- [02:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10464) successfully loaded you can access window.jquery

- [02:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10466) window.jquery you can use this as a test expression

- [02:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10468) you can use this as a test expression for the script tag helper like this

- [02:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10475) script okay so

- [02:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10481) so you see in the source code we are getting secret and then

- [02:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10483) getting secret and then we are having window jquery or document

- [02:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10486) we are having window jquery or document write

- [02:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10487) write the alternative secret path simply

- [02:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10491) the alternative secret path simply so if window jquery is not available

- [02:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10495) so if window jquery is not available it will document write the other script

- [02:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10498) it will document write the other script path

- [02:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10502) okay so we can add this and we can check the source code however since we

- [02:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10504) the source code however since we already have jquery it won't fail

- [02:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10508) already have jquery it won't fail and while we are getting jquery we are

- [02:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10510) and while we are getting jquery we are getting the gquery

- [02:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10511) getting the gquery from will start

- [02:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10515) from will start actually this is where we need to set

- [02:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10518) actually this is where we need to set this

- [02:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10519) this so the src will be this

- [02:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10522) so the src will be this okay it's already there and then the

- [02:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10525) okay it's already there and then the foldex here

- [02:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10526) foldex here okay src so let's

- [02:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10529) okay src so let's run our application by the way the order

- [02:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10532) run our application by the way the order matters so i need to put this

- [02:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10534) matters so i need to put this first because first this will be loaded

- [02:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10539) first because first this will be loaded and the other scripts will get loaded

- [02:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10542) and the other scripts will get loaded and they may fail if this is not

- [02:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10544) and they may fail if this is not available

- [02:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10546) available okay so let's stop the application

- [02:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10550) okay so let's stop the application and restart by the way we don't have a

- [02:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10553) and restart by the way we don't have a currently content

- [02:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10555) currently content folder and actually i will also do that

- [02:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10560) folder and actually i will also do that so let's also add content

- [02:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10573) it's on and we see how to serve the content for solving static content

- [02:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10578) the content for solving static content we need to have something i believe

- [02:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10600) so we can add file.css ignore the root of

- [02:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10615) let's see in the english okay so in the program cs file

- [02:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10623) we are going to have use static files do we have that

- [02:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10636) okay it is in the inside configure here and it is coming before loading

- [02:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10640) and it is coming before loading if okay for to be able to use studied

- [02:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10644) if okay for to be able to use studied files

- [02:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10650) then uh we can have a folder and pad yeah

- [02:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10651) yeah so surf files out of other web roots so

- [02:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10656) so surf files out of other web roots so the hierarchy is supposed to be sw

- [02:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10659) hierarchy is supposed to be sw root css images gs files and my static

- [02:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10663) root css images gs files and my static files as well

- [02:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10665) files as well i think i will use

- [02:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10672) the proper path so let's add a folder name it as w root

- [02:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10676) name it as w root okay then

- [02:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10683) inside here we are going to have gs folder

- [02:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10685) folder so where it is yeah that's folder

- [02:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10689) so where it is yeah that's folder as gs okay

- [02:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10693) as gs okay now let's go to our view start and

- [02:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10696) now let's go to our view start and download

- [02:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10697) download this jquery

- [02:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10704) okay let's save as so i'm going to download this into my

- [02:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10709) so i'm going to download this into my bootstrap lectures 11

- [02:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10713) bootstrap lectures 11 and inside lw and gs

- [02:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10716) and inside lw and gs and jquery mean actually i should

- [02:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10720) and jquery mean actually i should type the full version as well

- [02:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10723) type the full version as well such as

- [02:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10726) such as okay jquery okay it's not very much

- [02:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10729) okay jquery okay it's not very much necessary too

- [02:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10731) necessary too so let's also

- [02:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10734) so let's also add the path as so this will be on the

- [02:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10738) add the path as so this will be on the gs file let's

- [02:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10741) gs file let's look for the name conversion here

- [02:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10749) okay satisfies image structures okay so it will be ww

- [02:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10752) it will be ww root

- [02:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10761) yes and okay like this okay so let's run the application

- [02:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10764) okay so let's run the application first let's try it with

- [02:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10768) first let's try it with [Music]

- [02:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10771) [Music] let's try it with a regular

- [02:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10774) let's try it with a regular cd and jquery then i will

- [02:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10778) cd and jquery then i will change this url to something invalid and

- [02:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10782) change this url to something invalid and we will see if it is working serving

- [02:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10785) we will see if it is working serving from the

- [02:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10786) from the [Music]

- [02:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10788) [Music] our local host or not

- [03:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10802) how to serve static files in s.net and we

- [03:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10804) s.net and we see such as msegrip

- [03:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10808) see such as msegrip js same thing but let's write it

- [03:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10811) js same thing but let's write it html image css

- [03:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10820) etc okay so let's uh inspect our code

- [03:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10825) uh inspect our code that's also from the source code okay on

- [03:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10828) that's also from the source code okay on source code we see

- [03:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10829) source code we see this is generated by the tag helper

- [03:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10833) this is generated by the tag helper and this is the

- [03:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10840) link that is modified by my uh oh this is alternative thing okay

- [03:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10843) uh oh this is alternative thing okay this is the link

- [03:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10844) this is the link so in the network let's refresh it to

- [03:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10846) so in the network let's refresh it to see

- [03:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10852) okay so the cs file is i think modified from cage

- [03:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10855) i think modified from cage let's do a shift f5

- [03:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10859) let's do a shift f5 to do a local cage refresh

- [03:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10862) to do a local cage refresh but it is still coming from memory cage

- [03:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10864) but it is still coming from memory cage i see

- [03:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10865) i see okay it looks everything fine and it is

- [03:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10868) okay it looks everything fine and it is not

- [03:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10874) loaded from our [Music]

- [03:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10875) [Music] localhost let's see if we can see the

- [03:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10879) localhost let's see if we can see the okay so these are all cdn files you see

- [03:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10884) okay so these are all cdn files you see okay now i'm going to turn this into

- [03:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10887) okay now i'm going to turn this into something invalid okay let's make it

- [03:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10889) something invalid okay let's make it like this

- [03:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10891) like this and let's run the application

- [03:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10895) and let's run the application now our alternative fallback should work

- [03:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10909) now our alternative fallback should work and we should see that in our

- [03:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10912) and we should see that in our network uh traffic

- [03:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10915) network uh traffic okay let's check the inspect

- [03:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10919) okay let's check the inspect network let's refresh okay you see

- [03:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10922) network let's refresh okay you see jquery mean

- [03:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10923) jquery mean fail it and our

- [03:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10927) fail it and our oh our file is also faded

- [03:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10930) oh our file is also faded so let's open this in a new window

- [03:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10934) so let's open this in a new window yeah our static file is not served right

- [03:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10937) yeah our static file is not served right now

- [03:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10939) now that means we have an address

- [03:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10950) that means we have an address okay so where is our address

- [03:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10955) okay so where is our address we have enables

- [03:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10970) oh i need to remove ww root because it is the default naming

- [03:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10972) because it is the default naming convention

- [03:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10973) convention so it will be like this here i think and

- [03:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10978) so it will be like this here i think and check yes since we are using the default

- [03:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10982) check yes since we are using the default naming convention uh we don't need to

- [03:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10985) naming convention uh we don't need to provide ww root

- [03:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=10987) provide ww root as the pad

- [03:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=11014) okay so let's inspect and

- [03:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=11017) inspect and check network refresh

- [03:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=11020) check network refresh okay first one failures then the other

- [03:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=11022) okay first one failures then the other one is

- [03:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=11023) one is load as you can see it is coming from

- [03:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=11026) load as you can see it is coming from our

- [03:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=11028) our local host since this one fails the

- [03:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=11032) local host since this one fails the other one is loaded if it doesn't fail

- [03:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=11034) other one is loaded if it doesn't fail then other one won't be loaded let's

- [03:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=11037) then other one won't be loaded let's verify that

- [03:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=11038) verify that again so i fixed the i will fix the name

- [03:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=11060) and the link tag helper and this is the same as

- [03:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=11065) and this is the same as javascript basically and it also has

- [03:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=11069) javascript basically and it also has some

- [03:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=11070) some testing cases we will see about that in

- [03:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=11073) testing cases we will see about that in a moment

- [03:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=11074) a moment let's just learn this first properly

- [03:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=11078) let's just learn this first properly okay on the network when i refresh i see

- [03:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=11081) okay on the network when i refresh i see jquery mean and i don't see the other

- [03:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=11083) jquery mean and i don't see the other one because it is not

- [03:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=11085) one because it is not parsed therefore only it is loaded from

- [03:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=11088) parsed therefore only it is loaded from the

- [03:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=11089) the locals okay i'm in the cdn

- [03:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=11101) the link tag helper as we discussed in the previous article

- [03:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=11103) the previous article static contents such as javascript and

- [03:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=11105) static contents such as javascript and css has typically been served from the

- [03:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=11107) css has typically been served from the same server as the rest of the website

- [03:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=11110) same server as the rest of the website however as we also discussed in the

- [03:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=11112) however as we also discussed in the previous articles

- [03:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=11113) previous articles there are several good reasons to rely

- [03:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=11115) there are several good reasons to rely on a cdn instead for at least some of

- [03:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=11117) on a cdn instead for at least some of the static content

- [03:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=11118) the static content eg major javascript libraries and the

- [03:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=11121) eg major javascript libraries and the css they rely on

- [03:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=11123) css they rely on if you want to know more about the

- [03:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=11124) if you want to know more about the reasons go back and read the previous

- [03:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=11126) reasons go back and read the previous article

- [03:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=11128) article so when including javascript from a cdn

- [03:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=11131) so when including javascript from a cdn you can use the script tag helper

- [03:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=11133) you can use the script tag helper as we saw in the last article and for

- [03:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=11135) as we saw in the last article and for css files

- [03:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=11136) css files you can use the link tag helper

- [03:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=11144) okay the html link tag uses the ref attribute to dictate which file to

- [03:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=11145) attribute to dictate which file to include

- [03:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=11146) include so as in addition to that the link tag

- [03:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=11148) so as in addition to that the link tag helper offers the fallback ref attribute

- [03:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=11150) helper offers the fallback ref attribute which will be the path used at the cdn

- [03:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=11153) which will be the path used at the cdn version which should be provided in the

- [03:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=11154) version which should be provided in the ref attribute

- [03:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=11155) ref attribute fails for some reason here's an example

- [03:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=11160) fails for some reason here's an example asp fallback ref equals slash content

- [03:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=11163) asp fallback ref equals slash content slash bootstrap.mincss

- [03:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=11167) slash bootstrap.mincss in this case the css for bootstrap a

- [03:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=11170) in this case the css for bootstrap a popular web framework

- [03:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=11172) popular web framework will be loaded from the cdnjs a very

- [03:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=11174) will be loaded from the cdnjs a very popular cdn

- [03:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=11175) popular cdn location but if that doesn't work a

- [03:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=11177) location but if that doesn't work a local version will be requested from the

- [03:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=11179) local version will be requested from the local content folder instead

- [03:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=11182) local content folder instead however detecting that the cdn has

- [03:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=11184) however detecting that the cdn has failed to deliver the required css file

- [03:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=11186) failed to deliver the required css file can be difficult

- [03:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=11188) can be difficult but the link tag helper can help you

- [03:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=11189) but the link tag helper can help you with this okay it is basically the same

- [03:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=11192) with this okay it is basically the same as

- [03:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=11192) as previous one so

- [03:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=11196) previous one so to solve this issue let's go to our

- [03:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=11200) to solve this issue let's go to our we've start currently we don't

- [03:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=11201) we've start currently we don't have a cdm for css

- [03:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=11206) have a cdm for css let's copy paste this

- [03:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=11214) like this so let's first download this from the

- [03:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=11215) from the internet

- [03:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=11222) okay you see this is not available okay so bootstrap cdn

- [03:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=11231) available okay so bootstrap cdn and here's let's copy this

- [03:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=11246) you see it is change it yes download it okay

- [03:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=11249) download it okay save as and for css i will

- [03:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=11253) save as and for css i will generate a css file

- [03:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=11258) generate a css file okay let's generate a css folder under

- [03:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=11260) okay let's generate a css folder under the www

- [03:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=11261) the www root add new folder css

- [03:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=11273) we can rename wire running the website okay now i can save the css file

- [03:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=11278) okay now i can save the css file into my folder save as

- [03:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=11283) into my folder save as here

- [03:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=11285) here [Music]

- [03:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=11294) www.css okay bootstrap means css and it will be serviced under css

- [03:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=11297) and it will be serviced under css folders

- [03:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=11297) folders okay so usually there are test class as

- [03:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=11300) okay so usually there are test class as our only

- [03:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=11301) our only test property position and test value

- [03:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=11303) test property position and test value absolute

- [03:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=11304) absolute so for this to be able to work

- [03:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=11308) so for this to be able to work i think we don't need to do anything

- [03:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=11310) i think we don't need to do anything let's run the application to see

- [03:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=11313) let's run the application to see because it will be all handled and

- [03:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=11315) because it will be all handled and automatically done

- [03:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=11317) automatically done by the tag helper itself which talk

- [03:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=11319) by the tag helper itself which talk attack hardware

- [03:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=11320) attack hardware uh asp fallback tag helper

- [03:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=11324) uh asp fallback tag helper i'm in the asp pullback test class test

- [03:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=11327) i'm in the asp pullback test class test property and test value attack helpers

- [03:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=11353) first okay and let's okay you see as soon as i have

- [03:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=11357) and let's okay you see as soon as i have loaded

- [03:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=11358) loaded uh the bootstrap my entire pageview

- [03:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=11362) uh the bootstrap my entire pageview is updated according to the bootstrap

- [03:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=11373) visibility and it may even become responsive see

- [03:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=11382) i'm not sure okay and let's check the source

- [03:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=11383) source page so

- [03:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=11387) page so there is the script if it won't

- [03:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=11391) there is the script if it won't work so let's check it out

- [03:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=11399) work so let's check it out okay let's see if there is a generated

- [03:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=11401) okay let's see if there is a generated class

- [03:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=11402) class in somewhere

- [03:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=11412) okay yeah here's here i can see it meta name fallback

- [03:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=11414) here i can see it meta name fallback content yeah

- [03:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=11416) content yeah so this is the uh sitting

- [03:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=11419) so this is the uh sitting that it is checking whether the uh

- [03:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=11423) that it is checking whether the uh bootstrap is loaded or not and now it

- [03:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=11425) bootstrap is loaded or not and now it also has a script to do that

- [03:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=11427) also has a script to do that first let's draw a check from the

- [03:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=11430) first let's draw a check from the network

- [03:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=11432) network okay and do we see the css file

- [03:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=11436) okay and do we see the css file [Music]

- [03:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=11439) [Music] why oh here bootstrap css

- [03:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=11443) why oh here bootstrap css we can see it it is from others from the

- [03:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=11447) we can see it it is from others from the [Music]

- [03:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=11448) [Music] cdn and let's invalidate the cdn

- [03:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=11452) cdn and let's invalidate the cdn and let's see if it is loaded from our

- [03:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=11456) and let's see if it is loaded from our local host

- [03:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=11478) yes i can see it is working refresh you see this one is

- [03:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=11483) working refresh you see this one is failed and the localhost is

- [03:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=11487) failed and the localhost is not awesome it is working

- [03:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=11490) not awesome it is working you can also have alternative cdns as

- [03:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=11493) you can also have alternative cdns as foldback

- [03:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=11494) foldback url but i would suggest you to use your

- [03:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=11497) url but i would suggest you to use your own servers

- [03:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=11499) own servers okay so this was the

- [03:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=11503) okay so this was the last tutorial that we are going to see

- [03:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=11504) last tutorial that we are going to see today where we are left is

- [03:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=11511) here this was a very long lecture but it was

- [03:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=11513) this was a very long lecture but it was extremely

- [03:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=11514) extremely also an educative one so i'm hoping that

- [03:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=11518) also an educative one so i'm hoping that you will watch it

- [03:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=11519) you will watch it at least twice and

- [03:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=11523) at least twice and let's update our

- [03:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=11527) let's update our github repository

- [03:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=11560) all right actually we don't even need to push object folders uh unless you are

- [03:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=11564) object folders uh unless you are you are putting something manually to

- [03:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=11566) you are putting something manually to your debug you don't need to push

- [03:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=11568) your debug you don't need to push object folder it will be automatically

- [03:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=11570) object folder it will be automatically generated

- [03:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=11571) generated each time you run the application

- [03:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=11574) each time you run the application however i didn't spend time with that

- [03:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VUaQ2zv1s&t=11576) however i didn't spend time with that okay so end of lecture 11 i hope that
