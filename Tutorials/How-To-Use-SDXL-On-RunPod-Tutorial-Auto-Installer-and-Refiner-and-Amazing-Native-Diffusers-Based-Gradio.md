### Video Transcription


- [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=0) Greetings everyone, in this video I will show you how to run Stable Diffusion XL on RunPod

- [00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=7) as you are seeing here, seeing here and I will do some comparison with Midjourney generated

- [00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=15) images.

- [00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=16) I will also show you the difference between non-refiner and what happens when we use refiner

- [00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=25) steps.

- [00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=26) Moreover, I will explain how to generate as many as images you want and also how to generate

- [00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=33) bigger batch size images like generating 8 images at the same time.

- [00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=39) How to use refiner strength.

- [00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=42) How to use steps and how to use cfg scale.

- [00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=45) So for this tutorial I prepared a very detailed github readme file.

- [00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=50) All of the instructions and commands are written here.

- [00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=54) I will update this file as it be necessary, moreover the link of this file will be in

- [00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=60) the description of the video and also in the comment section of the video.

- [00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=65) So I have both auto installer script and also manual installation steps.

- [00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=71) Let's login into our RunPod account, click this link.

- [00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=74) If you don't have an account, just sign up.

- [00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=76) If you have account login.

- [00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=78) Go to community cloud, from here select your internet speed very high.

- [00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=83) This is important because we are going to download a lot of files.

- [00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=87) You can use any GPU which has over 20 GB.

- [00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=91) For demonstration I will pick 1 RTX 3090.

- [00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=95) Very important thing is customize deployment and increase volume disk size to 200 GB.

- [00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=102) Also from templates type stable and select RunPod fast Stable Diffusion and hit continue,

- [00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=109) hit deploy.

- [00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=111) Let's call this machine as manual installation.

- [00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=116) Let's also start another machine.

- [00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=118) For this machine I will use RTX A6000.

- [00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=122) This is 59 cents, the other one was 29 cents, but this machine has 48 GB VRAM.

- [00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=130) So let's also customize deployment, select volume disk 200 GB.

- [00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=136) Also our template is selected, continue and deploy.

- [00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=140) Let's name this machine as auto install SD XL.

- [00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=145) Auto installer script is very easy to use, go to this link.

- [00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=150) From here download this attached SH file, click it, it will download the SH file.

- [00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=156) Once the RunPods are started, you will see connect button enabled here.

- [00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=162) Patiently wait them to download the necessary files.

- [00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=167) Both of the pods are now ready.

- [00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=169) Let's begin with automatic installation connect, connect to jupyter lab, wait until jupyter

- [00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=175) lab interface loads, click this upload files icon, select the downloaded file.

- [00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=182) You see the downloaded file is uploaded here, start a new terminal, copy the link here,

- [00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=188) copy it, paste the command here, it will automatically install everything for you.

- [00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=193) You don't need to do anything else.

- [00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=196) Let's continue with manual installation because we will execute a lot of commands, connect,

- [00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=201) connect to jupyter lab.

- [00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=202) So the manual installation is explained here.

- [00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=206) You need to have Hugging Face account.

- [00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=209) If you don't have a Hugging Face account, just click join, register from here.

- [00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=215) Once you have your account, click login from here.

- [00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=218) Now you need to accept terms and conditions of these two repositories.

- [00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=224) I will show you click and open them.

- [00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=227) So here the first repository, how you are going to accept, you see they have researcher

- [00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=232) early access agreement, go to the very bottom and in here fill as you wish.

- [00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=238) I will fill as an example NA and I accept the above license agreement, submit application.

- [00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=244) Then we need to generate our Hugging Face access token.

- [00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=247) So open this link.

- [00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=248) Here, generate a new token, test, I will make as a read, generate token and copy it.

- [00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=255) After you copied it, paste it into a text file like this.

- [00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=260) Now we can begin executing the commands below.

- [00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=264) So open a new terminal, copy the first one, paste and hit enter, copy the next one, paste

- [00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=271) and hit enter, then copy the next one, paste and hit enter.

- [00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=275) Of course, you are waiting the commands here to be completed.

- [00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=278) Copy this one, paste and hit enter, copy this one, paste hit enter, copy this one, paste

- [00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=286) hit enter.

- [00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=287) Okay, then let's continue.

- [00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=289) This is a repository that I have edited to provide you the Gradio interface that is very

- [00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=296) easy to use, very convenient to use and supporting refiner of SDXL.

- [00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=302) For automatic installation you don't need to do anything.

- [00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=305) It will install everything.

- [00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=306) Manual installation is installing the requirements right now.

- [00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=310) Once you see like this, it means that the previous execution has been completed and

- [00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=315) you can continue copy, paste hit enter, copy paste hit enter, copy, paste hit enter.

- [00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=323) Okay, this step is very important.

- [00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=326) This will clone the SD XL version 0.9 into our workspace.

- [00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=333) However, for this to be working, we need to edit this URL.

- [00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=337) So copy it in the notepad file, paste it.

- [00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=341) So copy your hugging face token and replace this part.

- [00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=346) Also here, you need to write your Hugging Face username.

- [00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=350) So my username is here.

- [00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=352) I will copy it from here and I will paste it here, then copy the command and execute

- [00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=358) it in this screen.

- [00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=360) So you will see that it will start downloading all of the SD XL files into this folder.

- [00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=370) You need to wait here patiently because it will download about 100 gigabytes of files.

- [00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=376) That is why selecting high speed Pod is very important.

- [00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=381) These files will permanently remain on your workspace as long as you keep your RunPod.

- [00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=387) As long as you don't delete your RunPod.

- [00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=390) First repository cloning has been completed.

- [00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=393) You will get a message like this.

- [00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=395) Then we will continue.

- [00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=398) Copy this.

- [00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=399) This will delete all of the .safetensors files because we will use .binary files with our

- [00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=405) Gradio interface.

- [00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=406) And since this is running on cloud, you don't have anything to worry.

- [00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=412) Copy paste and hit enter.

- [00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=414) Why I am doing this?

- [00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=415) Because I am opening extra space in our pod.

- [00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=418) So then copy this command, hit enter, then copy this, hit enter.

- [00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=424) And we also need to modify this link copy from here.

- [00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=430) We need to copy the username and we need to copy the access token.

- [00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=437) Then copy the command like this and copy paste and hit enter and wait this one to be cloned

- [00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=443) as well.

- [00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=444) This repository is smaller than the previous one, so it won't take as long as this one.

- [00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=451) Both of the installations have been completed both manual and also automatic.

- [00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=457) Of course, automatic was fully automatic.

- [00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=459) Then for running it after installation, all you need to do is running this command.

- [00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=467) Also I have put the run command here.

- [00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=469) They are basically same.

- [00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=470) So let's start our SD XL Gradio application.

- [00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=474) Moreover, if you don't want to use refiner, just set this enable refiner to false.

- [00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=481) Okay, let's copy.

- [00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=482) Let's copy paste it in both of the RunPods.

- [00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=485) You see it is loading the pipeline as you are seeing right now in both of the RunPods.

- [00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=492) I am going to open is the manual one.

- [00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=495) So this is our interface.

- [00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=497) Enter your positive prompt here, enter your negative prompt here, set the number of images

- [00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=503) that you want to generate from here.

- [00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=505) Let's begin with this prompt.

- [00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=508) I will compare it with latest version of Midjourney copy text paste prompt here.

- [00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=515) Let's delete the unnecessary part like this.

- [00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=518) I'm not going to use any negative prompt, just hit generate and this is the automatic

- [00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=523) RunPod.

- [00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=524) So the difference is that automatic RunPod has a better GPU, manual RunPod has a weaker

- [00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=531) GPU.

- [00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=532) During the image generation, it is going to use all of your GPU.

- [00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=535) The GPU memory used is like this.

- [00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=539) Okay, we got the results.

- [00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=542) So this is our result.

- [00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=543) The left one is the one without refiner.

- [00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=547) The right one is the one with refiner.

- [00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=550) So let's open in a new tab like this.

- [00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=553) The native resolution is 1024 by 1024.

- [00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=557) This is without refiner and this is with refiner.

- [00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=562) Also this is another image generated in the other pod.

- [00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=565) So this is without refiner and this is with refiner.

- [00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=568) I think there is a significant improvement with refiner.

- [00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=571) Now I will delete the manual installation Pod to not waste my money and I will continue

- [00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=578) with automatic installation to show you more examples.

- [00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=582) And this was the Midjourney art.

- [00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=584) So it is up to your taste.

- [00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=586) Let's try this prompt, copy it, paste into prompt.

- [00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=590) Okay, looking good.

- [00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=591) I am not using any negative prompts and this is affecting my results.

- [00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=595) Maybe let's add some low quality.

- [00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=598) On the jupyterlab, you can see the progress.

- [00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=601) It is 5 it per second right now with batch size 1.

- [00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=605) Okay, and here we got our result.

- [00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=608) So let's open new tab and let's also open this new tab.

- [00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=613) Okay.

- [00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=614) This is 512 resolution and this is 1024.

- [00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=619) Let's add some more negatives.

- [00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=621) Okay.

- [00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=622) I have written some simple negative prompts.

- [00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=625) In the advanced setting.

- [00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=627) You will have batch size.

- [00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=628) So people were asking me what is number of images and what is images here.

- [00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=633) This is batch size.

- [00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=635) If I make this 4, it will generate 4 images at the same time.

- [00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=641) If I set this 4, it will generate 4 times images with the batch size here.

- [00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=647) So it will be 16 images as a beginning.

- [00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=650) Let's try with batch size 4, refiner strength and steps are default.

- [00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=656) And this is the CFG scale.

- [00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=657) You can also change it.

- [00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=659) You can also change the refiner strength and the number of steps that you want to use for

- [00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=665) generating images.

- [00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=666) Let's hit generate and let's see how our pod performs when generating 4 images at the same

- [00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=674) time.

- [00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=675) This is the GPU memory used as you are seeing right now.

- [00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=677) Now our it per second is 1.33, but we need to multiply it with 4.

- [00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=684) So it is basically 6.2 it per second.

- [00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=687) This is without refiner.

- [00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=689) Now the refiner step is coming up.

- [00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=691) Okay.

- [00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=692) With refiner, it was 1.22 it per second.

- [00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=697) We got the results.

- [00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=698) Let's check it out.

- [00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=699) Okay.

- [00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=700) Here are results.

- [00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=701) On the right we see the images generated with refiner on the left without refiner.

- [00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=708) I think the results are pretty good.

- [00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=711) Let's see.

- [00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=712) Let's open.

- [00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=713) So this is the result we got.

- [00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=714) Refiner is making huge improvement as you're seeing.

- [00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=718) Okay.

- [00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=719) Let's try this prompt.

- [00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=720) Copy text, open a notepad file, delete the unnecessary part like this, copy it, paste

- [00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=727) into here and let's set number of images to 10 and I will set the batch size back to 1

- [00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=735) and let's also increase number of steps to 100.

- [00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=740) Okay.

- [00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=741) Let's hit generate.

- [00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=742) This time it will generate 10 images, but 1 by 1.

- [00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=746) You can see the progress here.

- [00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=748) While generating images let me show you where the generated images are saved.

- [00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=753) Enter inside Stable Diffusion XL Demo folder in here, enter inside Stable Diffusion XL

- [00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=761) Demo.

- [00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=762) In here you will see outputs and all of the generated images will be saved here.

- [00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=768) The saved images are the images after refiner steps.

- [00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=772) So with double clicking, you can open them.

- [00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=774) You can also download entire folder as an archive, but using RunPodCTL would be much

- [00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=782) better for you.

- [00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=783) In this tutorial, I have shown how to use RunPodCTL.

- [00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=786) Open it.

- [00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=787) This is a pretty long tutorial.

- [00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=790) Look for the chapters where you want to learn.

- [00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=792) Just look at the description of the tutorial.

- [00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=794) You will see the chapters here and just click the chapter that you want to go.

- [00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=799) During the image generation, the images will not be displayed here.

- [00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=804) However, if you want to see them, go to the outputs folder and in the very bottom you

- [00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=810) will see the last generated images.

- [00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=812) You can double click them, open them, or you can right click and download them if you wish

- [00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=818) like this.

- [00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=819) Click download.

- [00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=820) I already have two tutorials for SD XL for Google Colab and for local installation and

- [00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=827) usage as well.

- [00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=828) I also added the links of these 2 tutorials to the readme file as well like this.

- [00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=834) Okay.

- [00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=835) The images were generated.

- [00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=837) I think the quality is amazing.

- [00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=840) Let's look at them in the new tab.

- [00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=842) Okay.

- [00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=843) I am opening them like this.

- [00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=844) Right click open new image and I will compare with the midjourney as well.

- [00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=850) Let's decide which one is the best one.

- [00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=853) Okay.

- [00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=854) They are all looking pretty amazing if you ask me.

- [00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=858) Okay.

- [00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=859) Let's close.

- [00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=860) Close.

- [00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=861) This is also a good one.

- [00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=862) Let's close.

- [00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=863) This is also a nice one.

- [00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=864) Okay.

- [00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=865) So this image is generated by midjourney which you pay a decent amount of money every month.

- [00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=873) You are seeing here the mid-journey image and these are SD XL version 0.9.

- [00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=880) Not even the officially version 1 and the quality is amazing.

- [00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=887) Let's compare these two like this.

- [00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=889) Let's decide which one is looking best.

- [00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=892) Okay.

- [00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=893) I can't decide which one is the best.

- [00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=896) Maybe let's compare this post.

- [00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=898) So copy image open paint .net.

- [00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=902) Let's make the double size like this on the left we see the Stable Diffusion X large image.

- [00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=909) So on the left we have Stable Diffusion X large which is free to use on the right we

- [00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=915) have midjourney latest version.

- [00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=918) Let's say you want to turn off non refiner images.

- [00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=922) What you need to do is go to your Stable Diffusion X large demo folder, in here you will see

- [00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=929) app7.py.

- [00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=930) Open it.

- [00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=932) In this file you will find this section.

- [00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=936) Okay.

- [00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=937) In here all you need to do is comment out here once you did comment out this line of

- [00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=945) code it won't display images anymore.

- [00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=948) CTRL-s and save or you can save it from here save Python file.

- [00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=953) After saving the file restart your pod which will be easiest way for your restart pod.

- [00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=959) Once pod has been restarted click Jupyterlab again you will get this until pod has been

- [00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=966) restarted.

- [00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=967) Copy the run command from here again open a new terminal copy paste and hit enter.

- [00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=973) The initial loading doesn't take too much time so it is not a problem to restart pod.

- [00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=979) This time let's try this prompt copy text I will copy the prompt here.

- [00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=985) The restart has been completed click the radio app copy paste the prompt let's also copy

- [00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=991) our previous negative prompts let's generate 4 images.

- [00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=994) Generate.

- [00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=995) You can watch the progress from here as you are seeing right now.

- [00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=999) It is doing 5 it per second when batch size is 1.

- [00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=1003) So what about refiner strength.

- [00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=1006) What is it doing when you set steps 50 and refiner step 30 percent it will do 15 refiner

- [00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=1015) steps and 50 original steps.

- [00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=1017) So if you make this 100 it will do 100 steps to generate initial image then 30 steps to

- [00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=1025) generate the refined image.

- [00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=1028) This is what does refiner steps do.

- [00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=1030) So this is why 50 steps are used for initial generation and 15 steps are used for refiner

- [00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=1037) image generation.

- [00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=1038) Ok the images have been generated.

- [00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=1041) This is SDXL.

- [00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=1043) You see non-refiner images are not shown anymore.

- [00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=1048) Let's compare with the midjourney.

- [00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=1050) So this was Midjourney image.

- [00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=1051) This is Midjourney and this is Stable Diffusion X large.

- [00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=1056) Let's open a new tab.

- [00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=1057) Ok Stable Diffusion X large and here we got the Midjourney.

- [00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTdPRm-R-14&t=1061) This is all for today.
