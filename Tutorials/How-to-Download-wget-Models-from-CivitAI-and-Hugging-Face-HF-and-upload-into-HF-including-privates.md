### Video Transcription


- [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5WVZ0NMaTg&t=0) Greetings everyone. Today I am going to show you how you can download models from CivitAI

- [00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5WVZ0NMaTg&t=5) or Hugging Face onto the cloud services such as RunPod, Massed Compute, Kaggle or Google Colab.

- [00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5WVZ0NMaTg&t=12) Some models on CivitAI require login. I will show you how you can download those login-required

- [00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5WVZ0NMaTg&t=18) models. Moreover, I will show you how you can download models from private repositories of

- [00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5WVZ0NMaTg&t=24) Hugging Face, including how to upload your models to Hugging Face or download them from

- [00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5WVZ0NMaTg&t=30) Hugging Face behind a private repository. So let's begin with downloading this Juggernaut

- [00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5WVZ0NMaTg&t=35) XL model. This is a public model. How do I know? When you right-click this download and open link

- [00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5WVZ0NMaTg&t=41) in private window, you will see that the download will start. Yes, as you are seeing. However,

- [00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5WVZ0NMaTg&t=47) some models such as this model are behind login. So when I do the same operation, it will not work,

- [00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5WVZ0NMaTg&t=53) as you will see right now. Yes. So first, let's download the public model. Right-click and copy

- [00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5WVZ0NMaTg&t=60) link address. This is on RunPod interface. Go to the folder wherever you want to download. Let's

- [00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5WVZ0NMaTg&t=66) download into the models, into the Stable Diffusion folder. This is where we put it. By the way,

- [00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5WVZ0NMaTg&t=71) this logic applies to every file. The logic is just not for models for Stable Diffusion. You

- [00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5WVZ0NMaTg&t=76) can download any file that you can download with a URL. So we are going to use wget command. If

- [00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5WVZ0NMaTg&t=83) this command is installed on your system, it is installed in almost any Linux system. You can use

- [00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5WVZ0NMaTg&t=90) it. Then put double quotation marks and paste the link like this. Then if you want to give

- [00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5WVZ0NMaTg&t=96) a certain name, file name, you need to do -O and in the double quotation mark type the

- [00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5WVZ0NMaTg&t=104) file name. Let's say the file name will be like this. Let's copy this, paste it and the extension

- [00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5WVZ0NMaTg&t=110) .safetensors and then just hit enter and it will start downloading the model into this folder as

- [00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5WVZ0NMaTg&t=117) you are seeing right now. So this is the way of downloading files which are public. So let's

- [00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5WVZ0NMaTg&t=123) copy this link and let's do the same thing on Massed Compute. So wherever you want to download,

- [00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5WVZ0NMaTg&t=128) open that folder. Let's open the folder of the Stable Diffusion. It is inside apps. This is my

- [00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5WVZ0NMaTg&t=135) virtual machine, inside Stable Diffusion web UI, inside models, inside Stable Diffusion. I will

- [00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5WVZ0NMaTg&t=141) open a new terminal here and then I will just copy paste it like this and it will start downloading

- [00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5WVZ0NMaTg&t=147) the model file into here with the accurate name. Okay, let's do the same thing on Google

- [00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5WVZ0NMaTg&t=154) Colab. So let's reconnect and also do it on the Kaggle notebook. Let's start the session. Okay,

- [00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5WVZ0NMaTg&t=160) session started. Let's generate a folder mkdir directory and let's say test1. So this will be

- [00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5WVZ0NMaTg&t=167) the directory where I want to download. Where is this directory generated? It is generated inside

- [00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5WVZ0NMaTg&t=172) here. You see test1 and you can copy its path from here like this. So you see this is the default

- [00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5WVZ0NMaTg&t=178) folder content of Google Colab. Let's move inside this directory. For example, cd content/test1 and

- [00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5WVZ0NMaTg&t=187) now we are inside that directory. To download it with the wget command, I will copy this

- [00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5WVZ0NMaTg&t=194) command from here. Let's copy it and then put an exclamation mark and then paste it and then just

- [00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5WVZ0NMaTg&t=201) execute this cell. Why we put this is necessary when you are running wget command on Google

- [00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5WVZ0NMaTg&t=207) Colab. Same applies for the Kaggle notebook. So let's generate a directory here as well, test1,

- [00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5WVZ0NMaTg&t=215) and let's generate it. And the directory is generated. So where is this directory? This

- [00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5WVZ0NMaTg&t=219) directory is generated under Kaggle working directory. You see here. So to move there,

- [00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5WVZ0NMaTg&t=225) we can use cd. This is how the cd works on Kaggle. Okay, we will say Kaggle/working/test1 like this

- [00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5WVZ0NMaTg&t=234) and then just execute and we are moved to there. Open a new interface. We use the exclamation

- [00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5WVZ0NMaTg&t=240) mark here as well, then just execute and the model will get started to downloaded into here,

- [00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5WVZ0NMaTg&t=247) into the test1 folder. Kaggle provides 20 gigabyte working directory. You can see it here. And also

- [00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5WVZ0NMaTg&t=255) it provides 70 gigabyte temporary directory. So if you want to generate temporary directory and use

- [00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5WVZ0NMaTg&t=262) the temporary disk space, it is like this: mkdir directory and then you will type /tmp like this

- [00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5WVZ0NMaTg&t=268) Kaggle/temp and let's say test1. This time we need to put another command here -p like this and it

- [00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5WVZ0NMaTg&t=277) will generate this directory and it is generated. Then we can move inside there cd Kaggle/temp/test1

- [00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5WVZ0NMaTg&t=286) like this and move there and we moved there. Then we can execute this command and it will

- [00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5WVZ0NMaTg&t=292) download this model into the Kaggle temporary test1 directory. So this is how the Kaggle

- [00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5WVZ0NMaTg&t=299) directory is working. On Google Colab there is no such thing. It directly gives you 100 gigabyte

- [00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5WVZ0NMaTg&t=306) disk space as you are seeing right now and you can see the files here. For Kaggle, you cannot see the

- [00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5WVZ0NMaTg&t=311) temporary files in here unfortunately. So you need to keep in mind wherever you have saved and how

- [00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5WVZ0NMaTg&t=318) to use them. Okay, now what about downloading from Hugging Face? If this is public repository, all

- [00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5WVZ0NMaTg&t=326) you need to do is move wherever the file that you want to download. Let's say we want to download

- [00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5WVZ0NMaTg&t=332) Realistic Vision version 2.0. So you see there is a direct download link here. Right-click and copy

- [00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5WVZ0NMaTg&t=338) link address. Then all you need to do is wget and paste the link like this. Again, I suggest

- [00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5WVZ0NMaTg&t=346) you to use double quotation mark like this, double quotation mark, and delete this "download" part

- [00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5WVZ0NMaTg&t=352) like this. So it is like this. This is the full file path. Then you can give a name. Let's say -O

- [00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5WVZ0NMaTg&t=360) and double quotation mark and let's give a new name Realistic_Vision_6.safetensors because this

- [00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5WVZ0NMaTg&t=368) is the extension and just copy this. So everything is same as downloading from CivitAI. Open a new

- [00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5WVZ0NMaTg&t=374) terminal from here wherever the folder that you want to download, paste it and it will get

- [00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5WVZ0NMaTg&t=379) downloaded with the name that you provided. It is same on Massed Compute as well. Just paste it and

- [00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5WVZ0NMaTg&t=386) then hit enter and it will get downloaded. The Massed Compute download speeds are amazing. On

- [00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5WVZ0NMaTg&t=392) Google Colab, same, just delete this and paste it like this. You see this is the format. By the way,

- [00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5WVZ0NMaTg&t=397) on Google Colab we need to put the exclamation mark like this and then it will work and yes,

- [00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5WVZ0NMaTg&t=403) it started downloading. On the Kaggle notebook, again same, just paste it,

- [00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5WVZ0NMaTg&t=408) put the exclamation mark to the beginning and hit enter and it will start downloading. wget command

- [00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5WVZ0NMaTg&t=415) doesn't work in Windows by default. So on Windows, you just need to click the links to download them.

- [00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5WVZ0NMaTg&t=421) Let me demonstrate. So when I click this link, it will start downloading the model immediately

- [00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5WVZ0NMaTg&t=426) like this or in here, just click this and it will start downloading the model. Okay, so what about

- [00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5WVZ0NMaTg&t=433) the model that is behind login for CivitAI? So we right-click and copy link address and then I

- [00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5WVZ0NMaTg&t=441) will just replace this link with that to test. So this is the link and let's say this is this model.

- [00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5WVZ0NMaTg&t=448) Okay, I am going to give the name like this and just copy this. Then,

- [00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5WVZ0NMaTg&t=452) when I paste it here, let's see what happens. Okay, I copy-paste it and

- [00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5WVZ0NMaTg&t=457) you see I get "unauthorized". So, how am I going to fix that issue?

- [00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5WVZ0NMaTg&t=462) To fix that issue, go to your CivitAI profile. Here,

- [00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5WVZ0NMaTg&t=465) you need to have registered and logged in. It is free. Go to the account settings,

- [00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5WVZ0NMaTg&t=469) then go to the very bottom of here and you will see "API Keys". Click "Add API Key" and let's give a name:

- [00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5WVZ0NMaTg&t=476) "test test" like this. This is your API Key. Copy it. Don't forget to copy.

- [00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5WVZ0NMaTg&t=482) Then, go back to your download link like this, put a question mark, type "token",

- [00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5WVZ0NMaTg&t=488) then "=" and paste your token. So this is the format: you see "?token=&lt;my_token&gt;",

- [00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5WVZ0NMaTg&t=497) the API Key. Then just copy it and let's return back to the RunPod.

- [00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5WVZ0NMaTg&t=501) Let's open a new terminal, paste the link, and this time it should work. And yes,

- [00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5WVZ0NMaTg&t=506) you see we are able to download that model onto the RunPod. It will work

- [00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5WVZ0NMaTg&t=511) with the Massed Compute as well. Let's just paste it and it started downloading.

- [00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5WVZ0NMaTg&t=516) Moreover, on the Google Colab, it still should work. So let's just delete this and

- [00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5WVZ0NMaTg&t=522) put an exclamation mark and just play, and you see it is downloading. Let's try it on

- [00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5WVZ0NMaTg&t=528) Kaggle as well. Let's just put an exclamation mark and play, and it started downloading.

- [00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5WVZ0NMaTg&t=535) Okay, what about the Hugging Face private repositories? Because let's say you uploaded

- [00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5WVZ0NMaTg&t=540) your models into a private repository and you don't want to make it public. So there are two

- [00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5WVZ0NMaTg&t=546) ways. For example, this repository of mine is currently private. I will make it public for a

- [00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5WVZ0NMaTg&t=554) moment to start downloading. This is the easier way. Let's just make it public and then you see

- [00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5WVZ0NMaTg&t=559) the download links are here. Just right-click, copy link address. Let's paste it here.

- [00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5WVZ0NMaTg&t=565) Okay, let's say "wget" double quotation marks like this. Don't forget to delete this part. Then,

- [00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5WVZ0NMaTg&t=571) let's give a name: "my_model.safetensors". Okay,

- [00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5WVZ0NMaTg&t=576) then copy it, go to the RunPod terminal, paste it, and it started downloading.

- [00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5WVZ0NMaTg&t=582) After the download starts, you can make it private again and it will continue

- [00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5WVZ0NMaTg&t=587) downloading as supposed to be. You see the download is working. So this way you can

- [00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5WVZ0NMaTg&t=592) minimize the risk of your models getting exposed and you can easily download them on Kaggle,

- [00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5WVZ0NMaTg&t=599) on Google Colab, on RunPod, or on Massed Compute, wherever you want.

- [00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5WVZ0NMaTg&t=604) However, if you don't want to expose it at any cost and if you have hundreds of files that you

- [00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5WVZ0NMaTg&t=611) want to download from the Hugging Face repository, I have prepared an amazing notebook file.

- [00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5WVZ0NMaTg&t=619) So this notebook file is shared here. Just click the attachment here,

- [00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5WVZ0NMaTg&t=624) download. This notebook file also works on Windows as well, I will show.

- [00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5WVZ0NMaTg&t=629) To use this notebook file, upload it anywhere into the RunPod interface, in the Jupyter

- [00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5WVZ0NMaTg&t=635) Lab interface. Okay, after uploading the notebook file, double-click and open it.

- [00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5WVZ0NMaTg&t=640) The instructions are so easy. Just click this cell. You will see that it is busy executing,

- [00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5WVZ0NMaTg&t=646) so wait until the "busy" is not there anymore. You can also see the status

- [00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5WVZ0NMaTg&t=651) here. So it has been installed. Then click this cell. If this cell gives you an error,

- [00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5WVZ0NMaTg&t=656) like in this RunPod, it is not an issue.

- [00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5WVZ0NMaTg&t=659) First of all, let's go to your Hugging Face tokens. Let's make a new token. Let's say

- [00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5WVZ0NMaTg&t=664) "test test" like this. Let's give read and write, so we can also upload. Then copy this,

- [00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5WVZ0NMaTg&t=670) go back to here. You must have logged in to your Hugging Face account. Then

- [00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5WVZ0NMaTg&t=675) replace the token here, just play this cell, and wait. Yes, it is now done.

- [00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5WVZ0NMaTg&t=682) Then you can download the entire repository from here. First of all, let's try downloading my

- [00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5WVZ0NMaTg&t=689) private repository, which is here. Copied this from there. This is the repository name. Wherever

- [00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5WVZ0NMaTg&t=695) you want to download them, I want to download them inside this folder. So to inside there,

- [00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5WVZ0NMaTg&t=701) I will right-click and copy path. On RunPod and also on Kaggle,

- [00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5WVZ0NMaTg&t=706) you need to put a backslash to the beginning like this. And I am ready.

- [00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5WVZ0NMaTg&t=710) Then I will just execute this cell and it will start downloading all of the files one by one,

- [00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5WVZ0NMaTg&t=716) like I am downloading into my computer. You see, it started perfectly fine.

- [00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5WVZ0NMaTg&t=722) The logic is the same wherever you are using it. So let's also try to upload a file as well.

- [00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5WVZ0NMaTg&t=726) To upload a single file, we will use this cell. To upload a folder,

- [00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5WVZ0NMaTg&t=732) we will use this cell. But I suggest you use this one for uploading. This

- [00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5WVZ0NMaTg&t=736) supports resume as well. So you can resume with this way if something interrupts.

- [00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5WVZ0NMaTg&t=741) So these are the cells to upload and download. Make sure that you

- [00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5WVZ0NMaTg&t=745) did set the full paths accurately and the repository names accurately and the

- [00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5WVZ0NMaTg&t=750) file name accurately if you are uploading a single file. If you are uploading a folder,

- [00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5WVZ0NMaTg&t=755) make sure that your folder path is accurate and your repository is accurate.

- [00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5WVZ0NMaTg&t=759) So how can you use this notebook on Massed Compute? So let's copy the notebook and let's

- [00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5WVZ0NMaTg&t=765) transfer it into our Massed Compute here. It is, so easy. Okay, then all I need to do is I just

- [00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5WVZ0NMaTg&t=772) need to start the Jupyter Notebook from here. You see, it will let me select. I am going to select

- [00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5WVZ0NMaTg&t=778) it inside the thindrives here, Massed Compute. This is my synchronization. You will see this

- [00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5WVZ0NMaTg&t=784) in my tutorials. I already have them. So this is the file and it will get started. And the steps

- [00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5WVZ0NMaTg&t=790) are the same: just execute this cell. So the rest is exactly the same. I'm not going to show again.

- [00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5WVZ0NMaTg&t=796) Okay, now we are going to use this on Kaggle. How we are going to use it? Let's open a new code,

- [00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5WVZ0NMaTg&t=801) go back here. Let's say we want to use the upload feature or download

- [00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5WVZ0NMaTg&t=807) feature. Let's try download. So I will copy-paste this here and execute it.

- [00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5WVZ0NMaTg&t=812) If you are not able to open this like this interface, you can use Visual Studio Code. So

- [00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5WVZ0NMaTg&t=817) actually, I will use that to open this file. Let's go to download and open with Visual Studio Code.

- [00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5WVZ0NMaTg&t=824) Then, to log in, I will use this one. Let's go back to Kaggle. The

- [00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5WVZ0NMaTg&t=828) steps are the same in Google Colab as well. Let's open a new tab here.

- [00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5WVZ0NMaTg&t=833) So we need to copy-paste our token. Let's copy the token. Then let's paste it here.

- [00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5WVZ0NMaTg&t=839) Then let's just save and it should work. Okay, it is done. I think it is done.

- [00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5WVZ0NMaTg&t=845) So to download the files, we copy this download cell. The upload is also the same. You just

- [00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5WVZ0NMaTg&t=851) need to give accurate paths. Okay, here. Then the repo ID. So the repo ID was here.

- [00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5WVZ0NMaTg&t=858) This is a private repo. Let's copy the repo ID. Let's paste the repo ID here.

- [00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5WVZ0NMaTg&t=863) Okay, target folder. Now I need to give the target folder. So I will copy the directory path from

- [00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5WVZ0NMaTg&t=869) here. By the way, this doesn't have much space, so it would get out of space, but it is fine. And

- [00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5WVZ0NMaTg&t=875) then just let's execute this cell and it should start. Let's see. The upload is also the same.

- [00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5WVZ0NMaTg&t=881) Yes, it started perfectly fine. Actually, let's also see the upload.

- [00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5WVZ0NMaTg&t=885) So for upload, let's use this Juggernaut XL. So I will copy this directory and I will

- [00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5WVZ0NMaTg&t=891) use the upload feature. So let's open a code here. Let's go back to our notebook file

- [00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5WVZ0NMaTg&t=899) and the upload cell is here. Let's copy-paste it.

- [00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5WVZ0NMaTg&t=902) Then let's copy the path. So let's delete this folder path from here.

- [00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5WVZ0NMaTg&t=907) The same steps apply to Google Colab, exactly the same steps. Okay,

- [00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5WVZ0NMaTg&t=911) where I want to upload? I want to upload them into this repository. Let's say, let's copy it.

- [00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5WVZ0NMaTg&t=917) Let's go back here. Paste, by the way, this repository type is so important. This is a model

- [00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5WVZ0NMaTg&t=922) repository. There are also other repositories. Which other ones? When you go to your profile

- [00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5WVZ0NMaTg&t=927) icon click, you can generate model, dataset, space, collection. If you generate a dataset, then

- [00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5WVZ0NMaTg&t=932) you need to use dataset. Okay we are ready. Let's play this cell and now this cell should upload

- [00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5WVZ0NMaTg&t=940) this into there. Let's see. Yes, it generated a new PR, then it will upload it and it will commit

- [00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5WVZ0NMaTg&t=948) that, and we will see the file there. We have this file currently. It is not completed. Let's

- [00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5WVZ0NMaTg&t=954) see. Okay, it says "Loading widgets". Yes, it is already uploaded and we can see that the upload

- [00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5WVZ0NMaTg&t=961) is here. When we go to the files, we can see that it is uploaded here. However, this file was

- [00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5WVZ0NMaTg&t=967) incomplete, so I will just delete it. This file is inaccurate. I am just showing you as a demo.

- [00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5WVZ0NMaTg&t=974) So, about the Google Colab, exactly the same. We just open a new code. First of all, we copy this

- [00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5WVZ0NMaTg&t=981) install cell. This install cell is mandatory everywhere. This is installing the necessary

- [00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5WVZ0NMaTg&t=986) libraries. Execute it. Then we need to set our token like we did. So, open a new code here, paste

- [00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5WVZ0NMaTg&t=993) it, copy your token from here. Let's copy it. Then go back to here. Let's set it. Then we are ready

- [00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5WVZ0NMaTg&t=1000) to download wherever we want. So, open a folder path here. Let's see, this is the copy. Okay,

- [00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5WVZ0NMaTg&t=1008) let's say we want to download this repository. Copy it. Then this is the repository name. Okay,

- [00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5WVZ0NMaTg&t=1014) where we want to download? Let's say we want to download inside "test1". So, copy path,

- [00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5WVZ0NMaTg&t=1019) then just delete this folder path and copy it, and just hit play and it will start. Don't... Oh,

- [00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5WVZ0NMaTg&t=1026) this was upload code. Sorry about that. Copy the download code. Okay,

- [00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5WVZ0NMaTg&t=1030) copy back again. Let's go to here, paste it. Let's copy this again, copy path like this,

- [00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5WVZ0NMaTg&t=1039) paste it and just hit play, and it will start downloading all the models into this folder.

- [00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5WVZ0NMaTg&t=1045) Okay, what about using this notebook on the computer?

- [00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5WVZ0NMaTg&t=1049) So, to be able to use it on your computer, you need to install Jupyter Notebook. Installing

- [00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5WVZ0NMaTg&t=1054) Jupyter Notebook requires only Python. You can see that, install Jupyter Lab. When you click it,

- [00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5WVZ0NMaTg&t=1058) it will show you this link. Once you installed it, you can open your Jupyter Notebook like this. So,

- [00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5WVZ0NMaTg&t=1064) after you open your Jupyter Notebook, everything is exactly the same. I will just click "Upload",

- [00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5WVZ0NMaTg&t=1070) upload the notebook like this, click "Upload", then the notebook will be uploaded. Just open it

- [00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5WVZ0NMaTg&t=1075) with double click and you see the same interface. It is running with Python 3. Everything is

- [00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5WVZ0NMaTg&t=1080) exactly the same. I just execute this cell, it will install the necessary libraries. Then

- [00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5WVZ0NMaTg&t=1085) set your token from here. Let's set, copy, exactly the same. Just execute this cell,

- [00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5WVZ0NMaTg&t=1091) it will be set. Then you can download, upload. You just need to set your folder paths. For example,

- [00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5WVZ0NMaTg&t=1097) let's give an example. Let's copy this, paste it here. Wherever I want to download,

- [00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5WVZ0NMaTg&t=1102) let's say I want to download into "Downloads" folder or perhaps, let's download into "R"

- [00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5WVZ0NMaTg&t=1107) drive. Let's download into "Mass Compute" folder. This is just an example. Okay, I copied the path,

- [00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5WVZ0NMaTg&t=1114) I paste it like this, and when you're working with Windows, also put an "r" key to the front of here,

- [00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5WVZ0NMaTg&t=1122) because it is working with Python, so it will treat this as a raw URL. And then let's execute

- [00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5WVZ0NMaTg&t=1129) this cell. You see, currently it is busy. I can also see the kernel is busy here, and it

- [00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5WVZ0NMaTg&t=1135) started downloading. You see, it is downloading with 55 megabytes per second. I can see the

- [00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5WVZ0NMaTg&t=1141) files are getting downloaded. So, it is working exactly as it should be, same as on the cloud.

- [00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5WVZ0NMaTg&t=1148) So, I hope you have enjoyed. Please like, subscribe, share this video, and you can download

- [00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5WVZ0NMaTg&t=1154) the notebook here, the most advanced, newest version. I will keep updating it. The link of

- [00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5WVZ0NMaTg&t=1159) this post will be in the description of the video. Hopefully see you in another amazing tutorial!
