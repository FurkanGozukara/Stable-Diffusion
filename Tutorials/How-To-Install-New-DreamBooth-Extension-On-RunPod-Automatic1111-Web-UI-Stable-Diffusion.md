### Video Transcription


- [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI0GEnrySS0&t=0) Greetings everyone, in this video I will show you how to install and run DreamBooth extension

- [00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI0GEnrySS0&t=6) on the web UI template on RunPods after their newest template changes.

- [00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI0GEnrySS0&t=11) I have been getting asked too many times so this will be a short video that I will only

- [00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI0GEnrySS0&t=15) explain how to install and run DreamBooth extension on RunPods.

- [00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI0GEnrySS0&t=19) So the most important thing is getting high RAM having RunPod like 62 GB and getting a

- [00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI0GEnrySS0&t=25) decent VRAM having graphic card like RTX A4500.

- [00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI0GEnrySS0&t=30) Let's click deploy.

- [00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI0GEnrySS0&t=32) Select the template here.

- [00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI0GEnrySS0&t=33) This is really important.

- [00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI0GEnrySS0&t=34) I am selecting RunPod Stable Diffusion 1.5.

- [00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI0GEnrySS0&t=37) Set your persistent volume as usual like 100 GBs.

- [00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI0GEnrySS0&t=41) Deploy.

- [00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI0GEnrySS0&t=42) Okay the pod has been started.

- [00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI0GEnrySS0&t=43) Let's connect.

- [00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI0GEnrySS0&t=44) Okay fresh pod is here.

- [00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI0GEnrySS0&t=46) First enter the Stable Diffusion web UI folder.

- [00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI0GEnrySS0&t=48) Start a new terminal.

- [00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI0GEnrySS0&t=50) Just type git pull.

- [00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI0GEnrySS0&t=52) Why?

- [00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI0GEnrySS0&t=53) Because we are updating if there is a newer version of the web UI then enter inside extensions

- [00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI0GEnrySS0&t=57) folder.

- [00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI0GEnrySS0&t=58) Start a new terminal here.

- [00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI0GEnrySS0&t=60) Copy the URL of the extension.

- [00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI0GEnrySS0&t=63) Type git clone and the extension URL.

- [00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI0GEnrySS0&t=66) It will clone it in here.

- [00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI0GEnrySS0&t=68) You see if you already have installed the extension and if you want to update it enter

- [00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI0GEnrySS0&t=72) inside the folder.

- [00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI0GEnrySS0&t=74) Open a new terminal here.

- [00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI0GEnrySS0&t=75) Type git pull.

- [00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI0GEnrySS0&t=76) This will update the extension.

- [00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI0GEnrySS0&t=78) Currently Automatic1111 web UI extension update mechanism is broken through the interface

- [00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI0GEnrySS0&t=85) so you should use git pull.

- [00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI0GEnrySS0&t=86) Okay now inside this extension folder we are going to install requirements.

- [00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI0GEnrySS0&t=92) To install them we will run a very simple command which is pip install -r requirements.txt

- [00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI0GEnrySS0&t=100) and that's it.

- [00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI0GEnrySS0&t=101) It will install all of the dependencies.

- [00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI0GEnrySS0&t=104) So this is the command you need to execute inside this folder.

- [00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI0GEnrySS0&t=109) Make sure that you are inside this folder where you are executing this command.

- [00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI0GEnrySS0&t=113) To open command window inside this folder press new launcher terminal and you will see

- [00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI0GEnrySS0&t=119) the terminal started inside this folder as you can see.

- [00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI0GEnrySS0&t=122) Okay everything was installed successfully.

- [00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI0GEnrySS0&t=124) You can just ignore these pip dependencies resolver message and then let's go back to

- [00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI0GEnrySS0&t=129) our web UI.

- [00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI0GEnrySS0&t=131) In here you need to change relauncher.py and prevent it relaunching again and again because

- [00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI0GEnrySS0&t=137) we are going to kill.

- [00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI0GEnrySS0&t=138) n&lt;1 and we also need the fix requirements version confliction.

- [00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI0GEnrySS0&t=145) This is the requirements version of web UI and then go back into the inside of extensions

- [00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI0GEnrySS0&t=150) folder inside DreamBooth extension open requirements txt and compare the versions.

- [00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI0GEnrySS0&t=155) If there are conflicting ones use the ones that are written in DreamBooth extension.

- [00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI0GEnrySS0&t=160) For example accelerate.

- [00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI0GEnrySS0&t=162) I am going to change accelerate version and then there is also transformers version.

- [00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI0GEnrySS0&t=166) This one.

- [00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI0GEnrySS0&t=167) I will also change the transformers version as well.

- [00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI0GEnrySS0&t=170) So here I have changed it and there is also one another one which is git python.

- [00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI0GEnrySS0&t=176) I am also changing the git python version.

- [00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI0GEnrySS0&t=178) Why we are doing this because when you restart your web UI it will overwrite the versions

- [00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI0GEnrySS0&t=183) of libraries and it will cause problems.

- [00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI0GEnrySS0&t=186) Once you're done all of this you need to restart your pod.

- [00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI0GEnrySS0&t=189) Go to the my pods section click restart pod.

- [00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI0GEnrySS0&t=192) Okay the pod has been restarted.

- [00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI0GEnrySS0&t=194) All we need to do is now kill the initial instance and then restart web UI.

- [00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI0GEnrySS0&t=200) So I am opening a terminal inside Stable Diffusion web UI folder type fuser dash -k 3000/tcp.

- [00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI0GEnrySS0&t=208) They added fuser command now it works then type python relauncher.py and it is going

- [00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI0GEnrySS0&t=216) to relaunch and we will get our DreamBooth extension working very well.

- [00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI0GEnrySS0&t=220) Okay it has been started but we have forgotten to add share command line arguments so we

- [00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI0GEnrySS0&t=225) are not getting Gradio link.

- [00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI0GEnrySS0&t=227) Let's edit and restart again.

- [00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI0GEnrySS0&t=229) Okay I need to first kill the previous instance.

- [00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI0GEnrySS0&t=232) When you click the instance you will see this is also terminated then retype python relauncher.py.

- [00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI0GEnrySS0&t=239) Okay it started as you can see when I click this URL now I will see the web UI on run

- [00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI0GEnrySS0&t=244) pod with the DreamBooth extension and yes it is working.
