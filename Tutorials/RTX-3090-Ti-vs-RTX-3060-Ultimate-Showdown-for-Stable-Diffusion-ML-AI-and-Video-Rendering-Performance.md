### Video Transcription


- [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=0) Greetings everyone, I want to express my sincere gratitude for your amazing Patreon, YouTube

- [00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=5) join and super thanks support.

- [00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=8) Your support is tremendously important to me on this journey.

- [00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=11) Thankfully, I was able to purchase the powerful 24GB Gainward RTX 3090 Ti Phantom GPU and

- [00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=22) the Cougar GX1050 80 Plus Gold power supply unit (PSU).

- [00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=25) My main purpose for this purchase is to conduct machine learning, artificial intelligence

- [00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=31) and video editing tasks, allowing me to carry out more research and produce high-quality

- [00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=36) videos for all of you.

- [00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=38) I will be showing you the speed, unboxing, and installation of the GPU and the power

- [00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=43) supply unit (PSU) while explaining the context and the flow of this video.

- [00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=48) The video will be divided into chapters so you can easily navigate to the parts that

- [00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=54) interest you and skip the GPU and power supply unit (PSU) installation part.

- [00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=58) You can find the chapters in the video description.

- [00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=61) The installation took about one hour and then I had to spend roughly two hours figuring

- [00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=66) out the problem that prevented the motherboard from starting.

- [00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=70) At first, I thought the new power supply unit (PSU) was problematic.

- [00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=74) I even had to test my older power supply unit as well.

- [00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=77) After carefully testing each hardware component, I found that one of the older hard drives

- [00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=83) was preventing the motherboard from starting and passing the GPU check with the new power

- [00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=88) supply unit.

- [00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=90) The fear of the defective new hardware or breaking existing hardware was real.

- [00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=95) Today, I will conduct a comprehensive review complete with benchmarks in machine learning,

- [00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=100) artificial intelligence and video rendering.

- [00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=102) I will test RTX 3090's performance in text-to-image tasks using Stable Diffusion, speech-to-text

- [00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=110) tasks with OpenAI's Whisper, and video rendering tasks using the free edition of DaVinci Resolve

- [00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=116) for 4K resolution video rendering and FFmpeg video rendering to upscale 4K resolution video

- [00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=123) into 8K.

- [00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=124) Furthermore, I will compare the 24GB RTX 3090 to my current 12GB Gainward GeForce RTX 3060

- [00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=135) Ghost Edition in each of these tests.

- [00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=139) Gainward is the most affordable option available here in Turkey, which is why I chose this

- [00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=144) brand.

- [00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=145) I have an MSI Mag B460M Mortar motherboard that has two PCI Express revision 3 with 16

- [00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=154) lanes x16 allowing me to use both the RTX 3060 and RTX 3090 simultaneously.

- [00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=161) I will also demonstrate how you can run two instances of Stable Diffusion Automatic1111

- [00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=167) Web UI on each card.

- [00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=169) First, I will show you how to install the latest Nvidia GPU driver, followed by the

- [00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=175) installation of PyTorch version 2 and latest CUDA toolkit.

- [00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=179) I will also compare the performance difference between PyTorch 1 version 13 and PyTorch version

- [00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=185) 2 for Stable Diffusion and OpenAI's Whisper tests.

- [00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=189) Next, I will start testing with OpenAI's Whisper.

- [00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=193) I will also show you the speed of the large model transcription on each card one by one

- [00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=198) and also simultaneously.

- [00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=200) The large model of Whisper is extremely GPU demanding and uses a lot of VRAM.

- [00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=205) After that, I will test the video encoding speed of DaVinci Resolve free edition.

- [00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=209) I will render a 4K resolution video and compare the speed difference between RTX 3060 and

- [00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=217) RTX 3090.

- [00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=218) 4K resolution video rendering is super GPU intensive.

- [00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=222) However, since I only have free edition of DaVinci Resolve currently, it is not fully

- [00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=228) utilizing the GPU.

- [00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=229) Therefore, I will also upscale a 4K resolution video with FFmpeg into 8K.

- [00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=235) FFmpeg is able to utilize 100% of the CPU.

- [00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=238) Then I will move on to the famous Stable Diffusion text to image generative AI model using the

- [00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=245) latest Automatic1111 web UI.

- [00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=247) I will show how to install latest Torch and xFormers for Stable Diffusion.

- [00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=252) I will test each card individually and at the same time with two instances.

- [00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=257) I will compare the iterations per second speed with the base model and single batch size.

- [00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=262) Then I will test speed of batch size 8 and maximum image resolution that each card can

- [00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=268) generate.

- [00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=269) Furthermore, I will test performance difference between the scaled dot product also as known

- [00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=274) as SDP Attention which is Torch version 2 optimization and the famous xFormers.

- [00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=280) Moreover, I will replace default cuDNN DLL files that comes with PyTorch installation

- [00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=286) with the latest cuDNN version 8.8.1 and see if it will improve the performance when using

- [00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=294) Stable Diffusion.

- [00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=295) Finally, I will test DreamBooth training speed on both cards.

- [00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=299) Additionally, I will monitor the power consumption of my computer using a wattmeter so we will

- [00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=305) see exactly how much power is being consumed when each card is working individually or

- [00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=311) when working simultaneously.

- [00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=313) Let's dive in together and explore the capabilities of these powerful GPUs.

- [00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=317) Thank you again for your support and I hope this review will be helpful to all of you.

- [00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=323) Let's begin with looking at the hardware that I have.

- [00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=326) For this task, I am going to use Tech Powerup GPU-Z and CPU-Z applications.

- [00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=333) On the left GPU-Z application, we are seeing the features of the RTX 3090 Ti version graphic

- [00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=341) card that I have.

- [00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=342) On the right one, we are seeing the features of the RTX 3060.

- [00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=347) There is one thing that I want you to pay attention.

- [00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=350) You see the second card is working at PCI Express version 3 with 4x lanes.

- [00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=358) Currently, it is displaying as version 1.1 but when it is under load, it displays PCI

- [00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=365) Express version 3 with only 4 lanes.

- [00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=368) And in here, you are seeing my CPU features.

- [00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=371) Intel Core i7-10700F CPU.

- [00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=375) It is working at 4.6 GHz usually even when it is under load.

- [00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=380) I have 64GB RAM memory.

- [00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=383) These are the clock speed and latency and other timings.

- [00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=387) You can also see the other features on this CPU-Z as well.

- [00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=390) And this is my motherboard.

- [00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=391) MAG B-460M Mortar.

- [00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=393) The download links of the applications that are used and shown in this video will be posted

- [00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=399) on my gist file.

- [00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=401) The link of this gist file will be in the description of the video.

- [00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=405) You are seeing the currently available download links and this file will get updated later

- [00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=410) if it is necessary.

- [00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=411) You are also seeing the PCI Express Speed.py file.

- [00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=415) This is the script that I have used to get these results.

- [00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=419) You will see more scripts in here.

- [00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=421) I will show you during the video.

- [00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=423) So when you click the raw button here, it will open the raw file and we will begin with

- [00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=429) downloading and installing Nvidia latest driver.

- [00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=432) To do that, go to this link right, click and go to.

- [00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=436) In here select your product type as GeForce or whatever the card you have.

- [00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=441) Select your cards series from here.

- [00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=443) This is my card series.

- [00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=445) Everything is correct.

- [00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=446) There are two types of drivers.

- [00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=448) First one is game ready driver and the second one is studio driver.

- [00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=452) You may ask what is the difference of them.

- [00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=454) The difference is that the studio drivers are more stable.

- [00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=458) However, I find that game ready drivers are more up to date and working as good as studio

- [00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=465) drivers for AI tasks for machine learning tasks.

- [00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=468) Therefore, I will be installing the latest game driver.

- [00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=471) After selecting all, click search and it will give you download link and download it once

- [00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=476) the download has been completed.

- [00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=478) Right click the downloaded file.

- [00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=480) Click run as administrator.

- [00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=482) It will ask you to start, click yes!

- [00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=485) Then it will extract the files into the selected drive.

- [00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=489) You don't need to change anything.

- [00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=490) Click ok, once the extraction has been completed, it will open the Nvidia installer, agree and

- [00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=496) continue.

- [00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=497) You can also pick only Nvidia graphic drivers.

- [00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=499) It is up to you.

- [00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=501) I am not using GeForce Experience so it is up to you.

- [00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=503) Agree and continue.

- [00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=505) I am picking custom advanced and in here I am selecting perform a clean installation.

- [00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=511) This is restoring all the Nvidia settings to their default values.

- [00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=515) This is what I prefer.

- [00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=517) Then click next and it will make the installation.

- [00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=520) After the installation has been completed.

- [00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=521) If you restart your computer, it may be more better.

- [00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=524) Now I will show you the Whisper tests of the cards.

- [00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=528) The testing strategy will be like PyTorch 1.13, PyTorch version 2, PyTorch version 2

- [00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=535) plus cuDNN 8.8.1.3.

- [00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=537) Each card one by one and both cards and I will also calculate their watt usages.

- [00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=542) If you don't know what is Whisper and how to install and use it I have an excellent

- [00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=546) tutorial for that on my channel.

- [00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=548) It's an awesome technology awesome public model.

- [00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=551) You can use it to transcribe speech into text.

- [00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=554) When I am doing nothing the watt usage of the computer is 132.

- [00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=558) So first I will install the PyTorch 1.13 version.

- [00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=563) I am using Python 3.10.8 as my default Python version and all of the benchmarks will be

- [00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=570) made on this version.

- [00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=572) If you don't know how to install Python I have an excellent tutorial this one.

- [00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=576) You can watch it to learn and install Python.

- [00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=579) So for installing PyTorch version 1.13 I am going to execute this command.

- [00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=584) It will download and install PyTorch 1.13 version with CUDA 11.7.

- [00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=590) The installation of the Torch has been completed.

- [00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=593) Now time to verify the installed versions.

- [00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=595) To do that, I have written a simple script.

- [00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=599) This script is also shared in the gist file.

- [00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=603) Just execute Python CUDA version.py and it will display you the default installed Torch

- [00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=610) version and the used CUDA version dll files as well.

- [00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=614) So you see the default version of CUDA is 11.7 the Torch version is 1.13 and CUDA 11.7

- [00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=622) and the version of the cuDNN DLL file used by the PyTorch is 8.5.0.0.

- [00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=628) Now I will update my Whisper to latest version.

- [00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=631) The version that I am going to use is shared also in the gist file.

- [00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=634) To do that, just copying this command, opening cmd, copy pasting, and executing.

- [00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=640) It will update it to latest version.

- [00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=643) For testing the Whisper I am going to use first five minutes of this video.

- [00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=647) I have extracted the first five minutes as an mp3 file.

- [00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=651) This is the Whisper command that I am going to use for testing purposes.

- [00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=655) I am going to use large model version one.

- [00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=658) I am also using best of 10 and beam size as 10.

- [00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=661) These are significantly increasing the GPU VRAM usage and the GPU usage.

- [00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=667) And with --device CUDA I will be providing the which GPU it should use.

- [00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=673) So for testing with maximum performance I will stop the video recording.

- [00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=678) But for demonstration let me show you how it is working.

- [00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=682) So you see currently my RTX 3060 graphic card is not used at all.

- [00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=687) I am starting a cmd window command line, pasting the code and hitting enter and it will start

- [00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=694) processing the mp3 file the speech file.

- [00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=698) So we will see that the GPU one which is RTX 3060 will start processing the mp3 file.

- [00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=705) We will see the increase of the VRAM usage memory usage.

- [00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=709) So it started processing right now.

- [00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=711) You see this is the VRAM memory usage it is using.

- [00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=714) Let's also see the values of GPU-Z.

- [00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=717) In the sensor we can see that how much VRAM is used.

- [00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=722) So it is using almost all of the VRAM.

- [00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=724) It is showing here.

- [00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=726) The GPU load is about 90.

- [00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=728) However the task manager is not displaying that.

- [00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=732) Currently I can see the GPU load in the Tech Power UP GPU-Z.

- [00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=736) It is also displaying the power that it is using.

- [00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=739) The wattmeter is also displaying 392 watts per hour at the moment.

- [00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=744) So with this strategy, now I will do all of the tests while not recording video and I

- [00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=750) will show you all of the results.

- [00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=753) Torch 1.13 tests have been completed.

- [00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=755) Now I will install Torch version 2 to continue testing and after all tests have been completed,

- [00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=761) I will show you all of them.

- [00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=763) To install Torch version 2.

- [00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=764) First, we need to uninstall the previous Torch version.

- [00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=767) "pip uninstall torch".

- [00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=769) It will uninstall the Torch version 1.13.

- [00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=770) It will ask you to proceed, click y button and it will uninstall.

- [00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=775) Then we will execute this command.

- [00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=777) This command will install Torch version 2.

- [00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=780) Torch version 2 installation has been completed.

- [00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=783) Let's verify our latest CUDA version with our script.

- [00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=786) So you see now CUDA version is 11.8.

- [00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=789) Torch version 2 tests also have been completed.

- [00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=793) Now I will install the latest cuDNN files.

- [00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=796) This is the link to download them.

- [00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=798) This is the raw version of the gist file.

- [00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=801) So for downloading this you have to make a free account and agree their to terms and

- [00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=807) you can click this link to download it as a zip.

- [00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=810) After downloading as a zip, extract it and enter inside.

- [00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=814) Inside the folder you will see bin folder, binary folder, then copy the dll files here.

- [00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=821) So this is the path of the dll files that you need to copy and then go inside your main

- [00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=826) Python installation folder.

- [00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=829) This is my Python installation folder.

- [00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=831) Inside there go to the lib folder.

- [00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=833) Inside here you will see site packages and inside here you will see Torch and in Torch

- [00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=839) you will see lib folder.

- [00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=841) Inside there.

- [00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=842) You will see the same name file dll files, paste them there, replace them.

- [00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=847) Now when we run our CUDA version py file, we see that cuDNN dll files used by the PyTorch

- [00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=855) is 8801.

- [00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=857) So this is the newest dll file that is provided by the Nvidia.

- [00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=862) All Whisper tests have been completed.

- [00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=865) I didn't notice any significant difference between Torch version 2 and Torch version

- [00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=870) 1.

- [00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=871) Or with the latest cuDNN file.

- [00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=873) RTX 3090 is able to process 2.7 seconds speech data in one second and RTX 3060 is able to

- [00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=882) process 1.78 seconds in one second.

- [00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=886) To ignore model loading time I waited each time the first 30 seconds speech data to be

- [00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=894) processed.

- [00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=895) Then I started the timer.

- [00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=896) So these are the pure processing times ignoring the model loading times.

- [00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=901) So this is the screenshot of the RTX 3060 when processing speech data.

- [00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=908) You see, these are the values.

- [00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=909) Unfortunately, TechPowerUp application do not have bigger resolution, so let me show

- [00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=916) you with zooming in.

- [00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=917) These are the RTX 3060 data, GPU clock, memory clock, GPU temperature.

- [00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=923) I have taken screenshots when they have processed over 4 minutes and 35 seconds.

- [00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=928) This is the memory used.

- [00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=929) It is using all of the memory.

- [00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=931) This is the GPU load, video engine load, board power draw you see this is the power consumption,

- [00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=937) percent to TDP.

- [00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=938) This is the hot spot in the GPU.

- [00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=941) So these are the values of RTX 3060 during the speech to text transcription by using

- [00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=947) OpenAI's Whisper.

- [00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=949) So RTX 3060 took 2 minutes 16 seconds to reach processing 4 minutes 30 seconds speech data.

- [00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=957) So now we are seeing the RTX 3090 data when it has processed 4 minutes 30 seconds speech

- [00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=964) data.

- [00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=966) It took 1 minute 30 seconds for RTX 3090 to process 4 minutes 30 seconds speech data.

- [00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=972) This is the GPU clock, memory clock, GPU temperature, hot spot temperature, memory temperature,

- [00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=977) fan speed.

- [00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=978) GPU load is 96% very, very good.

- [00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=981) It is almost using all of the GPU power.

- [00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=984) Memory controller load, board power draw.

- [00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=987) It is drawing 400 watts as you can see.

- [00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=990) So for RTX 3090, when alone working with Whisper, I saw about 500 watts maximum usage.

- [00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=999) You can calculate the PSU you need for RTX 3090.

- [00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=1003) However, probably this is not the maximum power that this card and the system can use.

- [00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=1008) This is for Whisper only.

- [00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=1010) So these are the other values that RTX 3090 used during transcribing speech into text.

- [00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=1017) The other Torch version and cuDNN version screenshots and the results are similar.

- [00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=1022) I will now show when both cards are running.

- [00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=1026) Now we are seeing the screenshot of when both cards started transcribing at the same moment

- [00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=1033) you see.

- [00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=1034) So when RTX 3090 had processed 4 minutes 30 seconds speech data, RTX 3060 were only able

- [00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=1044) to process 2 minutes 36 seconds speech data.

- [00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=1048) So these are the values of the transcription when both cards are working.

- [00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=1052) They are not much different when alone working actually.

- [00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=1056) So you see these are the data.

- [00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=1058) You can pause the video and look at the data if you wish.

- [00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=1062) So when both RTX 3060 and RTX 3090 were working at the same time doing Whisper transcribing,

- [00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=1070) I saw that watt meter shown 680 watts when peaking.

- [00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=1076) However, it was using 560 watts overall, so these are the watt usages as well.

- [00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=1081) Now I will do the 4k video rendering with Davinci Resolve 18.1 version: since I have

- [00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=1088) free edition, I am not able to fully utilize it.

- [00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=1091) So these are the settings that I can utilize as you see in the left panel here.

- [00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=1095) Currently RTX 3090 is selected.

- [00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=1098) The way that I am going to use is I will start rendering and see the timing that it takes.

- [00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=1107) Let me demonstrate you.

- [00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=1108) Then I will close video recording and recalculate the time because video recording is also taking

- [00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=1114) a lot of GPU power let me show you.

- [00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=1117) So you see when I am recording video it is using a lot of GPU, the OBS studio, and Nvidia

- [00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=1124) Broadcast.

- [00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=1125) Therefore, I have to stop video recording and do the speed test.

- [00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=1129) So I am adding the project to the render queue and hit render all.

- [00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=1133) In the right tab you see it is demonstrating the remaining time.

- [00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=1137) I will wait a little bit then this remaining time will become stable and I will see the

- [00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=1143) duration that it is going to take for each card.

- [00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=1146) The RTX 3090 rendering test has been completed.

- [00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=1150) Now I am selecting the default GPU as RTX 3060.

- [00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=1155) These are the settings that I am using in DaVinci Resolve.

- [00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=1158) Then I click save.

- [00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=1160) The DaVinci Resolve results are very interesting.

- [00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=1163) Probably I have discovered a bug in the software.

- [00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=1167) By the way, if you don't know how to use DaVinci Resolve, I have an excellent tutorial for

- [00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=1171) Davinci Resolve: the link will be in the description.

- [00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=1174) So when we look at the rendering results of the RTX 3090, we see that the GPU load is

- [00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=1181) 15% video engine load is 91%.

- [00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=1184) This screenshot taken after two minutes the rendering started.

- [00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=1189) So these are the values of the each card during the rendering of the 4k resolution video.

- [00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=1195) It is using minimal amount of memory, not much amount of GPU using a lot of video engine

- [00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=1202) load.

- [00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=1203) This is the board power it uses.

- [00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=1205) I checked from the watt meter and it was using around 250 watts in total.

- [00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=1210) So these are the values.

- [00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=1212) So for rendering 40 minutes 4k video, it was taking 68 minutes in total and these are the

- [00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=1220) rendering settings for 4k video.

- [00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=1222) Now, the interesting part is that when I change the selected GPU from here like this and save

- [00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=1229) and restart the application, it simply do not obey our settings.

- [00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=1234) Why I am saying that you see that RTX 3090 is still being used for video engine, which

- [00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=1241) means rendering as you can see.

- [00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=1243) However, this time the GPU load of RTX 3060 is not zero, so it is very weird.

- [00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=1250) I don't know what is actually happening.

- [00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=1252) The GPU load is now from taken from RTX 3090 to RTX 3060.

- [00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=1259) However, video engine load is still on the RTX 3090.

- [00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=1265) So these are the values of the each card when RTX 3060 is selected.

- [00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=1270) I am not able to select both of the cards at the same time with Davinci Resolve free

- [00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=1275) edition.

- [00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=1276) Probably this is a bug.

- [00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=1278) You see Bus interface load is only 16%.

- [00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=1282) Even though this card is working with PCI Express revision 3 with only four lanes x4

- [00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=1288) instead of 16 lanes, it is only using 16% of the 4x lane.

- [00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=1294) RTX 3090 is only using 3% for video rendering with DaVinci Resolve.

- [00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=1299) Even when two of the cards were being simultaneously used for Whisper transcribing task, we see

- [00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=1306) that the Bus interface load is still very minimal for RTX 3060 only 4%.

- [00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=1313) So for both of the benchmarks, the second PCI express is being 4x didn't make any significant

- [00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=1320) effect for RTX 3060 and we were able to utilize the graphic card fully.

- [00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=1326) In the Whisper the graphic cards were used with GPU load as you are seeing.

- [00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=1331) So before starting FFmpeg video encoding tests, I also wanted to show what kind of clip I

- [00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=1338) have rendered in the DaVinci Resolve.

- [00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=1341) I didn't use any effects or other things.

- [00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=1343) This is the clip that have been rendered.

- [00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=1346) So these are the clip properties currently you are seeing right now and when rendering

- [00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=1352) the sound was muted.

- [00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=1353) However, still I have exported the audio as well.

- [00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=1356) The recording was made with my Xiaomi phone.

- [00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=1359) It has overall bit rate 42 megabits per second as you are seeing right now.

- [00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=1364) This is only a part of clip.

- [00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=1366) The full render was multiple clips composition.

- [00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=1370) So it was a huge clip actually.

- [00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=1372) It is using chroma subsampling 4:2:0.

- [00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=1374) 8 bits progressive scan.

- [00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=1378) So these are all the attributes of the clip that has been used in the DaVinci Resolve

- [00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=1384) rendering benchmark.

- [00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=1386) For doing FFmpeg rendering tests we need hardware acceleration enabled FFmpeg version.

- [00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=1394) A version with CUDA support.

- [00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=1396) To download it, we are going to use this link.

- [00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=1398) GyanD releases.

- [00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=1399) GyanD FFmpeg releases have hardware acceleration support so you can download FFmpeg 6.0 full

- [00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=1408) build or whatever the latest version you are seeing when you are watching this video.

- [00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=1414) Now I will set environment variable path for the newest downloaded FFmpeg.

- [00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=1419) I will extract it into my c drive.

- [00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=1421) So I am cutting the binary files in the FFmpeg extracted folder.

- [00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=1426) So this is the folder where I did put the FFmpeg files.

- [00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=1430) Currently when I open my cmd window and type FFmpeg -version, this is the version currently

- [00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=1437) installed.

- [00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=1438) Now I will change the default FFmpeg file to the this newest file.

- [00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=1443) To setting default FFmpeg.

- [00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=1444) We are opening environment variables type envi and you will see this: edit: environment

- [00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=1450) variables.

- [00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=1451) In this screen.

- [00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=1452) Click environment variables in here we will add path of the FFmpeg.

- [00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=1457) I am going to do that for both user variables and system variables.

- [00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=1461) First click edit for user variables click new click browse select the folder where you

- [00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=1467) have installed.

- [00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=1468) So this is my latest installed one.

- [00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=1471) I am selecting it, then I am moving it to very top like this.

- [00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=1475) So now it is the first one.

- [00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=1477) Click ok then do the same thing for path variable in the system variables: click edit click

- [00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=1484) new click browse select the FFmpeg folder where you have extracted the binary files,

- [00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=1490) then move it to the very top.

- [00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=1492) So whatever is at the top will be used first in the path in the environment variables.

- [00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=1499) Click ok click ok click ok.

- [00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=1501) Then start a new cmd window.

- [00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=1504) Let's execute the same command FFmpeg version and now we are seeing the latest version FFmpeg

- [00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=1510) is being used.

- [00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=1512) It is displaying all of the capabilities.

- [00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=1514) Let's also see the CUDA support.

- [00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=1516) So these are the supported acceleration methods of the latest FFmpeg I am using.

- [00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=1522) I have prepared the FFmpeg commands that we are going to use for benchmarking and put

- [00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=1527) it on the gist file as well.

- [00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=1529) When you click raw, you will get the all of the description.

- [00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=1533) Let's see it in the notepad plus plus so we will see it better.

- [00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=1537) When you execute this.

- [00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=1539) It will hide the first GPU so that I will be able to use second GPU with the FFmpeg.

- [00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=1547) This is the real command that we are going to execute for the test.

- [00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=1551) It is using slow preset, variational bitrate also targeting 100 megabits per second.

- [00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=1558) It is also looking for the next 60 frames to calculate the necessary required bitrate,

- [00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=1565) max bitrate, buff size, and other options.

- [00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=1568) All of the options used are listed in here.

- [00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=1572) You can read them.

- [00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=1573) You can modify the prompt as you wish.

- [00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=1575) This is an extremely useful file.

- [00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=1578) So for the test file, I am going to use this mp4 file.

- [00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=1583) It has 42 megabits per second overall frame rate.

- [00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=1588) These are the attributes of the file as you are seeing right now.

- [00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=1592) By the way I also need to mention that the FFmpeg command we are going to use is going

- [00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=1598) to double the resolution of the input video file.

- [00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=1602) The input video file has 4k resolution, 3840 pixels for width and 2160 pixels for height.

- [00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=1611) We are going to upscale the video into 7680 pixels width and 4320 pixels height.

- [00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=1621) Moreover, I have turned all of the options into average values in the GPU-Z applications.

- [00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=1628) I also have opened core temp so when I take screenshot during the actual benchmarking,

- [00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=1633) we will see the average values.

- [00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=1635) When I start the benchmarking, I will reset the value so we will see the average values

- [00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=1640) of the testing.

- [00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=1641) So this will be the prompt.

- [00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=1643) It will start encoding.

- [00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=1644) When we reset, we will get the average values of the testing.

- [00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=1649) So currently it is using 100% video engine of the RTX 3090 graphic card.

- [00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=1657) The CPU load is pretty low actually.

- [00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=1660) As we are seeing right now in the core temp application.

- [00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=1662) The FFmpeg video encoding results are extremely shocking to me because RTX 3060 performed

- [00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=1671) almost same as 3090 with much lesser system watt usage.

- [00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=1676) Let's see the screenshots.

- [00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=1678) So currently we are looking at the screenshot of the 3060.

- [00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=1683) Let me show you.

- [00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=1684) These are the GPU clock memory clock, GPU temperature, hotspot temperature, fan speed,

- [00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=1690) the memory used, GPU load.

- [00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=1691) You see the video engine load is 100%, board power draw, and other variables you see.

- [00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=1698) Bus interface load is 0%.

- [00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=1700) That means that 4x PCI express didn't make any effect in this test as well.

- [00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=1705) The CPU usage is also very low.

- [00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=1707) Full load was on the GPU and here you see the bitrate of the generated file.

- [00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=1713) So far processed duration of the video file.

- [00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=1716) This is the speed.

- [00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=1717) This is the file size so far generated.

- [00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=1720) So these are all the results of RTX 3060.

- [00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=1722) Meanwhile, you can see the values of RTX 3090 as well.

- [00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=1728) Video engine load is 0% as expected.

- [00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=1731) Now we are seeing the values of RTX 3090 when encoding the video with FFmpeg.

- [00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=1737) It uses 5 gigabyte VRAM memory.

- [00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=1740) GPU load is 3%, video engine load is 100%, board power draw is 128 watts.

- [00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=1747) The speed is almost same as RTX 3060.

- [00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=1750) This is very, very interesting if you ask me.

- [00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=1755) So it processed 67 seconds in 4 minutes of processing time.

- [00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=1758) CPU load was also very low for this test as well.

- [00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=1762) So these are the values of RTX 3060.

- [00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=1766) Meanwhile, RTX 3090 is processing.

- [00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=1768) RTX 3060 was not used.

- [00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=1770) When both cards started processing at the same time.

- [00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=1773) It didn't make any changes because CPU was already able to handle all of the process

- [00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=1779) and these are the results when both cards are processing at the same time.

- [00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=1784) Nothing significantly different.

- [00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=1785) Now the fun part starts.

- [00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=1788) I am going to extensively test Automatic1111 web UI.

- [00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=1792) I have made two fresh installation of the web UI.

- [00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=1795) This is the first installation.

- [00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=1797) This is the only command line arguments that I have made.

- [00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=1800) xFormers and device id currently.

- [00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=1804) Let's also see the venv folder values.

- [00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=1806) So go to the venv scripts type cmd, activate, then I will execute the CUDA version py in

- [00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=1813) this venv environment.

- [00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=1814) Keep pressing shift button right click copy as path, then type Python paste it.

- [00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=1821) This script will be executed in this venv environment.

- [00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=1825) Currently, you see this venv environment has CUDA version 11.7.

- [00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=1830) Torch version 1.13 and the xFormers version is not up to date.

- [00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=1834) I will also update it with the command I have on the gist.

- [00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=1838) Click raw.

- [00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=1839) So for updating xFormers, I am copying the command here.

- [00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=1843) It is starting from here.

- [00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=1845) Copy it, paste it, hit enter and it will install the latest xFormers version compatible with

- [00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=1852) the Torch version 1.13.

- [00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=1853) This was the default version installed with the Automatic1111 web ui.

- [00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=1860) I will do the same in the second installation of the web ui as well.

- [00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=1864) Cmd activate execute command.

- [00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=1866) Then I am starting the web ui instances with webui- user.bat file.

- [00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=1872) The first one is going to use device id 0 which means that it will use RTX 3090.

- [00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=1879) The second web ui instance is going to use device id 1.

- [00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=1883) So this is the first instance of the web ui.

- [00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=1886) It is using these versions: Python 3.10.8, Torch 1.13, CUDA 11.7, xFormers 0018 dev 494

- [00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=1898) gradio commit and checkpoint.

- [00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=1900) Second instance of the web ui also started this time.

- [00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=1903) It is using the port 7861.

- [00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=1907) So this is the second instance.

- [00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=1909) It is also using the same versions.

- [00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=1911) This one is running on RTX 3060.

- [00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=1915) So I will do numerous testing on Stable Diffusion.

- [00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=1918) The first test is the it per second.

- [00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=1920) How am I going to do that?

- [00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=1921) I will use a simple prompt such as sports car.

- [00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=1925) You see this is the default model that Stable Diffusion web ui downloads.

- [00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=1931) I am making the sampling steps 150, batch count as 100.

- [00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=1937) So that I will be able to see how much it per second it is doing.

- [00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=1942) Let's start generate.

- [00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=1943) We are seeing about 40 it per second for RTX 3090.

- [00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=1948) Let's also look at the tech power up GPU values.

- [00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=1952) By the way, currently I am recording video.

- [00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=1954) It is using a lot of GPU already.

- [00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=1957) Therefore these are not best values.

- [00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=1959) I will stop the video recording, do the test, and then I will show you the screenshots.

- [00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=1964) I am just showing you the methodology that I am going to use.

- [00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=1968) Currently RTX 3090 is using six gigabyte VRAM memory and RTX 3060 is using 2.7 gigabyte

- [00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=1977) VRAM memory.

- [00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=1978) Let's also do some testing with that as well.

- [00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=1981) So, the RTX 3060 is performing about 7 it per second.

- [00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=1987) It is almost as half of the RTX 3090.

- [00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=1993) Let's also see the Bus usage.

- [00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=1995) Let's reset.

- [00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=1996) So the Bus interface load of RTX 3060 is only 2%.

- [00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=2001) That means that using PCI Express version three with only four lanes is not reducing

- [00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=2008) our GPU power.

- [00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=2010) By the way, RTX 3060 is consuming 150 watts and RTX 3090 is consuming 325 watts.

- [00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=2018) I see that 640 watts in my watt mete currently.

- [00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=2023) The watt usage is pretty high.

- [00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=2026) Also, CPU usage is not very high actually.

- [00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=2029) It is looking decent.

- [00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=2031) So this is the first test that I am going to do.

- [00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=2033) The second test methodology that I am going to do is the maximum resolution of images

- [00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=2039) that they can generate.

- [00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=2040) So for example, let's try 2048 pixel and 2048 pixel generation on the both cards.

- [00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=2048) Okay, I am doing the same.

- [00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=2051) So this will of course significantly increase the VRAM usage.

- [00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=2055) Let's see.

- [00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=2056) The VRAM usage of the RTX 3090 is.

- [00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=2059) Oh, looks like this failed.

- [00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=2062) Okay, looks like to be able to use this.

- [00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=2064) I need to add --no-half So I will also do that.

- [00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=2069) When you add --no-half command line argument it significantly reduces your speed.

- [00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=2075) Therefore, it is not optimal to test it per second.

- [00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=2079) When I am doing it per second testing i won't use it.

- [00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=2083) When I am doing maximum resolution testing, I will use it.

- [00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=2087) And the third test that I will do will be DreamBooth training.

- [00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=2090) I will repeat all of these tests with Torch version 1.13, Torch version 2, and with the

- [00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=2098) latest cuDNN files like I have done in the Whisper testing.

- [00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=2103) So now I will start testing and I will show you the results' screenshots.

- [00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=2108) All Stable Diffusion tests are completed but before delving into amazing results, shocking

- [00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=2115) results, and some new discoveries, I would like to show you my Stable Diffusion playlist.

- [00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=2122) So if you don't know how to use Stable Diffusion, I have an amazing playlist that is up to date.

- [00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=2127) If you don't have a good graphic card, the first two videos will teach you how to use

- [00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=2132) Stable Diffusion Dreambooth training on Google Colab for free.

- [00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=2136) Then the third video will show you how to install and use Automatic1111 we UI.

- [00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=2142) Fourth video will also help you with that.

- [00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=2145) The fifth video is my master video for DreamBooth training.

- [00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=2148) The sixth video is my master video for Textual Inversion training.

- [00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=2153) The seventh video is the master video for LoRA training.

- [00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=2156) Then eighth video, ninth video, and other videos will help you to improve your knowledge.

- [00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=2162) As you go down, you will get more recently recorded videos.

- [00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=2165) For example, sketches into epic art will teach you how to install and use ControlNet.

- [00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=2171) The ultimate RunPod tutorial will teach you how to use Stable Diffusion Automatic1111

- [00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=2176) Web UI on the RunPod.

- [00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=2178) Then this epic Web UI DreamBooth update video will teach you a lot of settings, configuration

- [00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=2185) about DreamBooth training on Automatic1111 Web UI.

- [00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=2189) You see all of the videos I have are extremely useful.

- [00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=2193) You can learn how to teach style and yourself at the same time into a model.

- [00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=2199) That means teaching two concepts at the same time into a model.

- [00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=2203) I also have epic animation video and also Kandinsky 2.1 version tutorial as well.

- [00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=2211) So check out the playlist.

- [00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=2213) The playlist link will be in the description and also will be in the comments as well.

- [00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=2217) So now we can start analyzing our results.

- [00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=2221) The first results I have made are based on the PyTorch 1.13 version, xFormers version

- [00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=2228) 0.0.18 dev 494 and cudNN DLL files are 8500.

- [00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=2237) When generating images with 512 512 on the base model, RTX 3090 reached 14.61 it per

- [00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=2246) second.

- [00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=2247) Let's open the testing image.

- [00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=2250) So this is the image of CUDA version 11.7, Torch version 1.13, RTX 3090.

- [00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=2257) You see it has reached 14.61 it per second.

- [00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=2262) I have used 512 512.

- [00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=2264) This is the command line arguments I have used only xFormers device id 0.

- [00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=2270) This is the results of CUDA version .py file.

- [00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=2273) You will find this file in the gist repository.

- [00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=2276) The CPU usage is pretty low.

- [00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=2278) The GPU load is only 75%.

- [00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=2281) The GPU user 320 watts while working.

- [00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=2284) It used about 5 gigabyte VRAM memory.

- [00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=2287) These are the other values of the card when generating 512 images.

- [00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=2292) I just used sports car and I used the base model as I have shown in the beginning.

- [00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=2298) So now we are seeing the results of RTX 3060.

- [00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=2302) It has used about 4 gigabytes VRAM.

- [00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=2304) GPU load is higher than the RTX 3090.

- [00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=2308) It used almost all of it.

- [00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=2309) It used about 150 watts.

- [00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=2312) You are seeing the GPU temperature, hotspot temperature, and other values as you are seeing

- [00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=2317) right now.

- [00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=2318) So these are the results for RTX 3060.

- [00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=2322) I have written incorrect arguments here.

- [00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=2324) Actually, I have used --device id 1 and I am also improving it in the other test I will

- [00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=2330) show you.

- [00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=2331) So for image generation with 512, RTX 3090 is over 100% faster than RTX 3060.

- [00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=2339) When we do hires fix image generation I have tested all of the resolutions.

- [00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=2347) So I have started testing from 1920 pixel and it caused NaN-error every time.

- [00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=2355) So the highest resolution that I was able to generate images with high res fix was 1216

- [00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=2362) 1216.

- [00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=2363) When we go upper it was generating NaN-images in the UNET.

- [00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=2368) So currently we are seeing the hires result of RTX 3060 with Torch version 1.13.

- [00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=2376) It was taking 18.28 seconds per it when generating the high resolution image.

- [00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=2385) You know first it generates the simple image, then it generates the hires resolution of

- [00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=2389) it.

- [00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=2390) This is the speed of the RTX 3060.

- [00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=2393) It was using 7 gigabyte of VRAM memory.

- [00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=2395) It was using GPU load 100% drawing 160 watt from the PSU.

- [00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=2403) Still Bus interface load was very low.

- [00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=2405) So PCI Express revision 3 with only 4 lanes was not a problem at all.

- [00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=2411) So these are the values of the RTX 3060 when generating high resolution and hires fix image.

- [00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=2419) When we look at the results of RTX 3090, it was much faster than RTX 3060.

- [00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=2428) The card shined when generating high resolution images.

- [00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=2432) So this time RTX 3090 was able to utilize 100 of GPU.

- [00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=2438) It was using 8 gigabyte VRAM memory.

- [00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=2441) It was drawing 441 watts from the PSU as you are seeing right now.

- [00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=2446) It is a beast.

- [00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=2447) The CPU usage also was not very high you are seeing right now.

- [00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=2451) The load of the CPU is pretty low.

- [00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=2453) So most of the hard work is done by the GPU, not the CPU when generating high resolution

- [00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=2459) images.

- [00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=2460) So these are the other values of the GPU.

- [00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=2463) You can just pause the video and look at them.

- [00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=2465) When both of the cards were generating high resolution images, I have seen that the wattmeter

- [00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=2472) was reading 750 watts per hour.

- [00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=2476) So if you want to use two cards at the same time, you should get minimum 800, perhaps

- [00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=2482) 850 watts a good PSU.

- [00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=2486) If you use only RTX 3090, perhaps you may get away with 650 watts good PSU.

- [00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=2493) So for high resolution image generation, the RTX 3090 was almost 200% faster.

- [00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=2502) You are seeing the difference right now.

- [00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=2504) The lower value is better because this is second per it and the above is it per second.

- [00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=2511) Just the opposite.

- [00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=2512) So one iteration took 6.21 seconds for RTX 3090 to process.

- [00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=2518) It took 18.28 seconds per it to process for RTX 3060.

- [00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=2525) So for DreamBooth training, I used the same settings and RTX 3090 performed 3.03 it per

- [00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=2533) second and RTX 3060 performed 2.20 it per second.

- [00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=2539) So this is the image of RTX 3090 when doing DreamBooth training.

- [00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=2544) It was only utilizing 60% of the GPU.

- [00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=2547) It was using only 240 watts per hour.

- [00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=2551) So these are the settings used for DreamBooth training.

- [00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=2554) It was performing 3.03 it per second.

- [00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=2558) These are the command line arguments: xFormers device id 0.

- [00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=2563) This is the CPU usage.

- [00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=2564) This is the used CUDA version, Torch version, and the dll file version.

- [00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=2568) I will also quickly show you the DreamBooth settings.

- [00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=2571) These are not important.

- [00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=2573) The important part is I didn't use gradient checkpointing.

- [00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=2576) Set gradients to none when zeroing was checked.

- [00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=2578) This is the learning rate, but this is not also important.

- [00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=2581) Max resolution is 512.

- [00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=2583) This is important.

- [00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=2584) I didn't use EMA because RTX 3060 is not able to do training with EMA.

- [00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=2591) As optimizer I have used 8bit AdamW because with other optimizers, RTX 3060 is not able

- [00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=2598) to do training.

- [00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=2599) Out of memory error: mixed precision bf16 xFormers is enabled.

- [00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=2605) Cache latents is enabled.

- [00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=2606) Train UNET is enabled.

- [00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=2608) This is the step rate of text encoder training, so these are the other values.

- [00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=2613) I didn't use offset noise.

- [00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=2615) I also have used classification images so the bucket size were double of the training

- [00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=2620) data set.

- [00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=2621) Actually, the training data set size is not affecting a lot and these are the saving settings.

- [00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=2626) But these are not the best settings.

- [00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=2628) For best settings check out my channel.

- [00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=2631) Actually for best settings for DreamBooth, check out this video.

- [00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=2634) This is the best video that you will find for best settings of DreamBooth training.

- [00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=2638) Okay then next I have installed PyTorch version 2 with xFormers 0.0.18 and cuDNN file 8700.

- [00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=2648) I have followed the same steps that I have shown in the beginning.

- [00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=2653) Also, by watching this video you can learn more about how to install these versions in

- [00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=2660) more details along with the DreamBooth installation.

- [00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=2663) This is the video how to install new DreamBooth and Torch 2 on Automatic1111 web UI.

- [00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=2668) Then we see some difference.

- [00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=2670) The it per second is raised from 14.61 to 15.83 for RTX 3090.

- [00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=2677) However, for RTX 3060, it is reduced 7.07 to 6.8.

- [00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=2688) So therefore RTX 3090 gained over 8% speed increase and RTX 3060 lost 4% speed.

- [00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=2699) When doing high res fixed image generation, RTX 3090 speed up from 6.21 second it to 6.04

- [00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=2712) seconds per it, which means around 3% speed increase.

- [00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=2717) For RTX 3060 the speed gain is more dramatic.

- [00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=2722) You see when generating the regular 512 512 image the RTX 3060 lost speed.

- [00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=2729) However when generating high resolution image with high res fix, it gained speed.

- [00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=2735) It increased second per it from 18.28 to 17.37 seconds per it, which is equal to around 5%

- [00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=2747) speed gain.

- [00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=2748) So depending on your purpose, you can use either PyTorch version 2 or PyTorch version

- [00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=2754) 1.13 with your RTX 3060.

- [00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=2757) But for RTX 3090, always use PyTorch version 2 with the latest version of xFormers.

- [00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=2765) For DreamBooth there is also speed gaining.

- [00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=2768) From 3.03 it per second to 3.24 it per second in RTX 3090.

- [00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=2775) Also with RTX 3060 from 2.20 it per second to 2.27 it per second.

- [00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=2782) So right now we are seeing the screenshot of RTX 3060.

- [00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=2786) When generating 512 images, it is using about 95% of GPU load.

- [00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=2792) Now it is using a little bit more board power.

- [00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=2796) These are the other values.

- [00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=2797) You see.

- [00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=2798) The CUDA version is 11.7.

- [00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=2800) The below also you are seeing the displayed values here and this is the it per second

- [00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=2806) value.

- [00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=2807) To be able to use second card with DreamBooth, I have to change the webui-user.bat file.

- [00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=2815) You have to add set CUDA visible devices equal one.

- [00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=2820) Otherwise, when doing DreamBooth training, it is using the device zero.

- [00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=2824) So if you have two devices and you want to do DreamBooth training on the second device,

- [00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=2829) you need to add this.

- [00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=2830) This ensures that the second device is used and the first device is not used and as a

- [00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=2837) command line argument I am just using xFormers.

- [00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=2840) So this is the screenshot of the RTX 3090 when generating 512 images.

- [00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=2846) This time it is using about 80% of GPU higher than before and these are the other values.Board

- [00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=2853) power draw and the other values you are seeing.

- [00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=2856) This time the CUDA version was 11.7.

- [00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=2859) Torch version is like here: this is the it per second.

- [00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=2862) These are the other versions used and this is the command line arguments used.

- [00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=2867) So these are the high res values for Torch Version 2 for RTX 3090.

- [00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=2872) It is using GPU 100%.

- [00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=2875) Memory controller load is also pretty high.

- [00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=2879) It is drawing 437 watts from the PSU.

- [00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=2884) Using about 9 gigabyte VRAM memory and these are the other values of the card while generating

- [00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=2890) high res image.

- [00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=2892) It is taking 6.04 seconds per it.

- [00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=2896) This is the resolution and high res fix is enabled and these are the command line arguments

- [00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=2901) used and these are the versions.

- [00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=2904) So these are the DreamBooth training values.

- [00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=2906) And then I have tested: --opt-sdp-attention You may wonder what is this.

- [00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=2911) This is an optimization that is supposed to replace xFormers with Torch version 2.

- [00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=2921) You see currently I am displaying the wiki of the Automatic1111 web UI.

- [00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=2926) It says that --opt-sdp-attention faster speeds than using xFormers.

- [00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=2933) Only available for users who manually install Torch version 2 and also this is non-deterministic.

- [00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=2940) There is also deterministic version, but it is a little bit slower.

- [00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=2944) There is also xFormers you are seeing --force enable xFormers, opt split attention, cross

- [00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=2951) attention layer optimization significantly reducing memory usage for almost no cost.

- [00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=2956) Some report improved performance with it.

- [00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=2958) This is by default on so you don't need to add this.

- [00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=2962) This is by default on.

- [00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=2964) Also, this below one disable state optimization and there are some other optimization parameters.

- [00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=2970) As you are seeing right now.

- [00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=2972) --medvram --lowvram.

- [00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=2974) So this is Torch version 2 optimization: when we are using this, I didn't use xFormers.

- [00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=2981) This increased the speed of the image generation for RTX 3090.

- [00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=2988) When generating 512 images you see, it jumped from 15.83 it per second to 16.39 it per second.

- [00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=3001) It didn't change the image generation speed for RTX 3060.

- [00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=3005) So if you are going to generate images with RTX 3090 or newer cards, you can use --opt-sdp-attention:

- [00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=3012) however, there is one very big issue.

- [00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=3018) When generating high resolution image with high res fixed image generation.

- [00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=3023) There was a very weird bug.

- [00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=3025) It was generating image and after the last step when composing the image, it produced

- [00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=3031) memory error.

- [00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=3032) Now let me show you some screenshots.

- [00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=3035) Currently we are seeing the test results of opt SDP Attention device id 0 RTX 3090 so

- [00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=3043) these are the values: power draw is around 350 watts.

- [00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=3048) It is able to generate images with 16.34 it per second.

- [00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=3052) These are the usb CUDA version, Torch version and the dll file version.

- [00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=3057) You are seeing xFormers is N/A not available torch version.

- [00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=3061) And now we are seeing the results of RTX 3060.

- [00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=3065) When opt SDP Attention is enabled, it is able to reach 6.80 it per second.

- [00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=3073) It is using 96% of the GPU.

- [00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=3076) CPU usage is never a lot so CPU was never the limiting factor when I am doing experiments.

- [00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=3083) Now the very interesting discovery that I have made.

- [00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=3087) When opt SDP Attention is enabled.

- [00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=3090) I will show you a very interesting thing.

- [00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=3093) So you see it was using very minimal amount of VRAM around six gigabyte during the high

- [00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=3100) res fixe image generation with RTX 3090.

- [00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=3105) However, after the generation is done and when generating the image, you see the memory

- [00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=3111) usage is just skyrocketing and then we are getting out of memory error.

- [00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=3117) So the message is in sdp attention block forward we got Torch CUDA out of memory error.

- [00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=3124) CUDA out of memory.

- [00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=3126) Tried to allocate 15.91 gigabyte on the GPU-0 and it exceeded the total capacity.

- [00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=3134) So with this attention we were not able to generate high res fix image.

- [00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=3140) So you need to use xFormers if you want to generate high resolution images and also get

- [00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=3146) speed up.

- [00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=3147) So in the DreamBooth also, opt SDP Attention reduced the it per second speed.

- [00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=3153) It reduced from 3.24 to 2.47 it per second for RTX 3090, this is a very dramatic speed

- [00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=3162) decrease actually.

- [00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=3163) It lost around 25% speed with just using opt SDP Attention instead of using xFormers.

- [00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=3172) The same speed decrease also exists in RTX 3060.

- [00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=3176) Then I did tests with cuDNN 8801 dll file and there weren't any significant speed difference

- [00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=3185) between the cuDNN 8700 dll file.

- [00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=3190) While thinking about results, a new discovery came to my mind.

- [00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=3195) If you don't use any optimizations such as xFormers or opt SDP Attention, then you can

- [00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=3203) generate very high resolution images.

- [00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=3205) For example, if you try to generate over 1448 1448 pixel when xFormers is enabled, you will

- [00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=3215) get NansException.

- [00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=3216) A tensor with all NaNs was produced in Unet.

- [00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=3221) This could be either because there is not enough precision to present the picture or

- [00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=3225) because your video card does not support half type.

- [00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=3228) However, this is not true.

- [00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=3230) Even if you enable float 32 or --no-half still, you won't be able to pass this resolution.

- [00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=3238) However, if you don't use xFormers or opt SDP Attention, then both of the cards RTX

- [00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=3246) 3090 or RTX 3060 is able to generate 2048 pixel 2048 pixel resolution image.

- [00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=3255) This also applies to hd resolution fix as well.

- [00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=3259) So if you are getting NaNs exception error, let me demonstrate you so with 1456 pixel

- [00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=3267) resolution, even on RTX 3090, I am getting this NaNs exception error.

- [00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=3274) However, when no xFormers or other optimizations are used, both of the cards are perfectly

- [00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=3280) able to generate with 2048 pixel and 2048 pixel resolution and they will be also able

- [00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=3288) to generate even higher high res fix as well.

- [00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=3292) Let's also see the values.

- [00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=3294) So you see RTX 3060 is using about 11 gigabyte VRAM memory for this resolution with 100%

- [00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=3303) GPU load with 150 watts per hour.

- [00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=3307) These are also the other values as you are seeing right now.

- [00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=3310) RTX 3090, on the other hand is using 18 gigabyte VRAM memory for the same resolution with 100%

- [00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=3318) GPU load.

- [00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=3319) So with higher resolution we are able to hit 100% with RTX 3090.

- [00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=3325) Memory controller load is also 100% and it is consuming 450 watts per hour from our power

- [00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=3333) supply unit.

- [00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=3334) So this is a new discovery that I have made.

- [00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgP1LNnaUaQ&t=3336) This is all for today.
