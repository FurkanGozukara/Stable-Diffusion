### Video Transcription


- [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=0) Hello everyone, today I will be guiding you&nbsp; step-by-step through the process of training

- [00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=6) LoRA on the latest state-of-the-art text-to-image&nbsp; generative AI model, FLUX. Over the past week,

- [00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=14) I have been deeply immersed in research, working&nbsp; tirelessly to identify the most effective training

- [00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=22) workflows and configurations. So far, I have&nbsp; completed 72 full training sessions and more

- [00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=30) are underway. I have developed a range of unique&nbsp; training configurations that cater to GPUs with

- [00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=37) as little as 8GB of VRAM all the way up to 48GB.&nbsp; These configurations are optimized for VRAM usage

- [00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=46) and ranked by training quality. Remarkably,&nbsp; all of them deliver outstanding results. The

- [00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=53) primary difference lies in the training speed.&nbsp; So yes, even if you are using an 8GB RTX GPU,

- [00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=61) you can train an impressive FLUX LoRA at&nbsp; a respectable speed. For this tutorial,

- [00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=67) I will be using Kohya GUI, a user-friendly&nbsp; interface built on the acclaimed Kohya

- [00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=73) training scripts. With this graphical user&nbsp; interface, you will be able to install,

- [00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=78) set up, and start training with just mouse clicks.&nbsp; Although this tutorial demonstrates how to use

- [00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=84) Kohya GUI on a local Windows machine, the process&nbsp; is identical for cloud-based services. Therefore,

- [00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=92) it is essential to watch this tutorial to&nbsp; understand how to use Kohya GUI on cloud

- [00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=97) platforms, even though I will be making separate&nbsp; tutorials specifically for cloud setups. We will

- [00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=103) cover everything from the basics to the expert&nbsp; settings. So even if you are a complete beginner,

- [00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=110) you will be able to fully train and utilize an&nbsp; amazing FLUX LoRA model. The tutorial is organized

- [00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=116) into chapters and includes manually written&nbsp; English captions, so be sure to check out the

- [00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=122) chapters and enable captions if you need them. In&nbsp; addition to training, I will also show you how to

- [00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=128) use the generated LoRAs within the Swarm UI and&nbsp; how to perform grid generation to identify the

- [00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=135) best training checkpoint. Finally, at the end of&nbsp; the video, I will demonstrate how you can train

- [00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=141) Stable Diffusion 1.5 and SDXL models using the&nbsp; latest Kohya GUI interface. So I have prepared

- [00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=150) an amazing written post where you will find all&nbsp; of the instructions, links, and guides for this

- [00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=159) amazing tutorial. The link to this post will be in&nbsp; the description of the video, and this post will

- [00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=165) get updated as I get new information as I complete&nbsp; my new research with new hyperparameters and new

- [00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=173) features. So this post will be your ultimate&nbsp; guide to follow this tutorial, to do FLUX LoRA

- [00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=182) training by using the Kohya GUI. Kohya GUI is&nbsp; a wrapper developed by the Bmaltais that allows

- [00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=189) us to use Kohya SS scripts very easily. This&nbsp; is its official GitHub repository. Basically,

- [00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=196) we are using Kohya SS. However, we have a GUI&nbsp; and one-click installers and easy setup to use

- [00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=203) the Kohya SS scripts. So you will see that I have&nbsp; a zip file here. When you go to the bottom of the

- [00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=211) post, you will also see the attachments, and in&nbsp; the attachments, you will see the zip file. I

- [00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=217) may have forgotten to put the zip file at the&nbsp; very top of the post, but when you look at the

- [00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=222) attachments, you will always find the zip file. So&nbsp; let's download the zip file. Click here. Move this

- [00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=228) zip file to any disk that you want to install. I&nbsp; am going to install it on my R drive. Do not

- [00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=235) install it in your Windows folder, into your users&nbsp; folder. Directly install into any drive, or do not

- [00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=242) install it in your cloud drives. Okay, right-click&nbsp; and extract it. Enter the extracted folder,

- [00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=249) and you will see all of these files. These files&nbsp; may get updated, and there may be more files when

- [00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=256) you're watching this tutorial. Don't get confused.&nbsp; I will update everything as necessary. Currently,

- [00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=262) the main branch of the Kohya GUI doesn't support&nbsp; the FLUX training. You see, there is a SD3 FLUX

- [00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=268) branch. So my installer will automatically switch&nbsp; to the FLUX branch and install it for you. Once it

- [00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=276) is merged into the main branch main repository,&nbsp; I will update my installers. To install Kohya

- [00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=282) GUI we are going to use the Windows_Install_Step_1.bat file. Double-click it. It will clone the

- [00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=287) repository, switch to the accurate branch, and it&nbsp; will start the installation. For this to work, you

- [00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=294) need to have the requirements installed. You'll&nbsp; see that we have a Windows requirements section.

- [00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=300) We need Python 3.10.11, FFmpeg, CUDA 11.8, C++&nbsp; tools, and Git. Now, once you install these,

- [00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=309) you will be able to use all of the open-source AI&nbsp; applications like Stable Diffusion, Automatic1111 Web

- [00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=315) UI, Forge Web UI, One Trainer, Swarm UI, ComfyUI,&nbsp; and whatever you can imagine, like Rope Pearl, Face

- [00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=323) Fusion, and such things. So I have a very good&nbsp; tutorial that shows how to install all of this.

- [00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=329) Please watch this tutorial. Do not skip it. Please&nbsp; make sure that your Python is directly installed

- [00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=334) on your C drive. You have installed FFmpeg,&nbsp; CUDA, and C++ tools. These are all important.

- [00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=340) How can you check whether you have installed them&nbsp; or not? Type CMD and open a command prompt like

- [00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=345) this. Type Python and you should get 3.10.11. Open&nbsp; another CMD and type Git and you should get Git

- [00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=352) code like this. Open another CMD and type FFmpeg&nbsp; and you should get FFmpeg. FFmpeg is not necessary

- [00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=359) for Kohya, but you should install it because&nbsp; you may use other AI applications. And type nvcc

- [00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=366) --version, and this will let you see whether you&nbsp; have installed the correct CUDA or not. Everything

- [00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=373) is explained in this video. Please watch it to&nbsp; avoid any errors. So the automatic installation

- [00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=380) will ask you these options. We are going to select&nbsp; option 1 and hit enter. Then this will start

- [00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=386) installing the Kohya SS GUI latest version to&nbsp; our computer. Currently, we are in the accurate

- [00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=392) branch. As I said, I will update this branch when&nbsp; it is merged into the master branch. Just wait

- [00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=400) patiently. You see that it is showing me I have&nbsp; Python 3.10.11. It is installed, and it is going

- [00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=406) to download and install everything automatically&nbsp; for me. So the installation has been completed,

- [00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=412) and I have the new options. You should scroll up&nbsp; and check whether there were any errors or not

- [00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=419) because the installation step is extremely&nbsp; important. So scroll up and check all of the

- [00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=425) messages. So as a next step, we are going to set&nbsp; the Accelerate because on some computers it may

- [00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=431) not be set correctly. So type 5 and hit enter.&nbsp; It is going to ask us some of the options. We

- [00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=438) are going to use this machine. Hit enter. We are&nbsp; not going to do distributed training. Hit enter.

- [00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=444) We are not training on Apple or anything.&nbsp; We are training on CUDA drivers. So no,

- [00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=449) we are not using Torch Dynamo. No, we are not&nbsp; using DeepSpeed. No, we are going to use all of

- [00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=456) the GPUs. So type "all" and hit enter. I also say&nbsp; yes to this, but I didn't see any difference. Hit

- [00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=462) enter. And we are going to use BF16. This one. So&nbsp; select this one and hit enter. And we are ready.

- [00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=470) And we are ready. You don't need to do option&nbsp; 2, option 3, or option 4. But we are not going

- [00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=476) to use option 6 to start yet. So hit 7 and hit&nbsp; enter. Return back to the folder. And whenever you

- [00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=483) are going to start training or after the initial&nbsp; installation, run this bat file: Update_Kohya_and_Fix_FLUX_Step2.bat

- [00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=491) This is going to upgrade to&nbsp; the latest libraries. It is going to also update

- [00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=496) the scripts to the latest version. So we are&nbsp; going to have the very latest version with this

- [00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=502) bat file. I will keep these files updated. Just&nbsp; wait for it to install everything. The steps are

- [00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=509) also written in this post file, but watching&nbsp; this video is better. And the updates have been

- [00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=514) completed. Verify that they are all working. We&nbsp; are currently using Torch 2.4.0. And it is working

- [00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=522) slowly on Windows compared to the Linux systems.&nbsp; However, with Torch 2.4.1, hopefully this speed

- [00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=532) issue on Windows will be fixed. And as soon as&nbsp; it is released, I am going to update my installer

- [00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=540) scripts. There has been a new development after I&nbsp; have completed the tutorial video, which is Torch

- [00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=548) 2.5 version. With this version, there is a huge&nbsp; speed improvement on Windows. It is almost equal

- [00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=558) to Linux. However, Torch 2.5 version is currently&nbsp; in development. So it may be broken. It may give

- [00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=566) you errors. I also didn't test its quality yet.&nbsp; Hopefully, I will test it and I will update the

- [00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=572) Patreon post. You see, it is already updated. The&nbsp; file that you need to use is: Install_Torch_2_5_Dev_Huge_Speed_Up.bat file

- [00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=583) after completing&nbsp; the installation. As I said, this is experimental

- [00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=586) and follow the news on the Patreon post. And now&nbsp; we are ready to start using the Kohya SS GUI. So

- [00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=594) for starting the Kohya SS GUI, you can either&nbsp; enter the Kohya SS folder and start the gui.bat

- [00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=601) file. Or you can use my automatic starter file,&nbsp; which is the Windows start KohyaSS.bat file. This

- [00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=608) will automatically start and open the browser.&nbsp; You see the interface has started. If it doesn't

- [00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=614) start, you need to open this manually. All right,&nbsp; now this is the interface of Kohya. It is very,

- [00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=619) very useful and easy to use. A very important&nbsp; thing that you need to be careful of is that

- [00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=625) you need to select LoRA because we are currently&nbsp; training LoRA. LoRA is optimization. So it is

- [00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=633) different from DreamBooth. DreamBooth is basically&nbsp; fine-tuning, training the entire model. But with

- [00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=638) LoRA, we are only training a certain part of&nbsp; the model. Thus, it requires lesser hardware,

- [00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=646) but also results in lesser quality. Currently,&nbsp; this tutorial is for LoRA training. Hopefully,

- [00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=651) I am going to do full research on DreamBooth&nbsp; fine-tuning and publish another tutorial for

- [00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=657) that. And I am going to publish configurations as&nbsp; well. So this tutorial is so far the combination

- [00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=663) of over 64 different trainings. This&nbsp; is literal. When you go to this post,

- [00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=669) you will see the entire research history. This is&nbsp; a very, very long, lengthy post. You will see all

- [00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=675) of the tests I have made. You will see all of the&nbsp; results, grids, and comparisons. I am also going

- [00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=681) to show some of the parts in this tutorial.&nbsp; So read this post if you want to learn how I

- [00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=687) came up with my workflow and configuration. Also,&nbsp; when you open this post, you will see all of the

- [00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=693) models that I have prepared up to now. And this is&nbsp; not all. Currently, I am running 8 different

- [00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=701) trainings on 8x RTX A6000 GPUs on Massed Compute.&nbsp; You can see the trainings are running right now.

- [00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=710) Currently, I am testing a new hyperparameter&nbsp; and the clip large text encoder training,

- [00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=716) which has arrived just today. So after these tests&nbsp; have been completed, I am going to analyze them,

- [00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=723) post the results on this research topic, and I&nbsp; am going to update the configuration files. Don't

- [00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=729) worry, you will just load the configuration. You&nbsp; will just download the latest zip file and load

- [00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=734) the configuration, and you will get the very best&nbsp; workflow, very best configuration whenever you are

- [00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=740) watching this tutorial. So that is why following&nbsp; this post is extremely important. The link will

- [00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=745) be in the description and also in the comment&nbsp; section. Don't forget that. So now our interface

- [00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=750) started and I am going to load the configuration&nbsp; for beginning the setup. I have selected the

- [00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=756) LoRA in the training tab. When you look at the&nbsp; folder, you will see best configs and you will

- [00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=761) see best configs, better colors. And what do these&nbsp; configurations mean? When you scroll down, you

- [00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=769) will see the description of each configuration. I&nbsp; have prepared a configuration for every GPU. So if

- [00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=776) you have an 8GB GPU, you need to use this one:&nbsp; Rank_9_7514MB.json file. When you enter inside

- [00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=785) the best configs folder, you will see that the&nbsp; JSON file is there. So according to your VRAM,

- [00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=792) pick the configuration file. There are slow and&nbsp; fast versions. What do they mean? With the slow

- [00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=799) version, we are going to get slightly better&nbsp; training quality. There is not much difference

- [00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=805) between rank 1 and rank 6. After rank 6, we are&nbsp; going to lose some quality because of the reduced

- [00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=814) training resolution and also reduced LoRA rank.&nbsp; If you read the research post, you will see the

- [00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=820) difference of each configuration. Training under&nbsp; 1024 pixels seriously reduces the quality. Also,

- [00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=829) I find that LoRA rank 128 is the very best spot.&nbsp; So these three configurations will have slightly

- [00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=837) lesser quality than these ones. These ones will&nbsp; be very, very close. Since I have an RTX 3090 GPU,

- [00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=845) I am going to use the very best configuration&nbsp; rank 3. Currently, this is running slow on my PC,

- [00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=853) but with the Torch version 2.4.1, it will be much,&nbsp; much faster. So go to here and click this icon,

- [00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=862) this folder icon, enter inside the folder of best&nbsp; config and load the rank 3. Now you may wonder

- [00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=870) what is the difference with better colors. This&nbsp; is in experimentation. Currently, I am training

- [00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=876) it to decide whether to fully switch to it or&nbsp; not. But this uses time step shift sampling

- [00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=883) and it makes a huge impact on the coloring. When&nbsp; you open this file, you will see this very big,

- [00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=890) huge grid. And when you look at this grid file,&nbsp; you will see that using the time step shift

- [00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=897) brings better colors and a better environment like&nbsp; this one. However, it also slightly reduces the

- [00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=903) likeness. I am still researching it. I am still&nbsp; training it. When we open this imgsli link,

- [00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=909) you can see a one by one comparison. So according&nbsp; to your needs, decide the configuration you want.

- [00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=915) Hopefully, I will complete research on time&nbsp; step shift sampling and I will decide the

- [00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=920) very best configuration. Currently, we have two&nbsp; different configurations and their difference is

- [00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=925) like this. But to be safe, you can use the best&nbsp; configs folder right now. However, you can also

- [00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=930) use best configs better colors too. So look at&nbsp; the grid file imgsli and decide yourself. OK,

- [00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=937) as a next step, you don't need to set anything&nbsp; here. This is for multi GPU. I also have multi

- [00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=942) GPU configs and I will show them hopefully in the&nbsp; cloud tutorial. I am going to also make a cloud

- [00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=947) tutorial for Massed Compute and RunPod. So&nbsp; what you need to set with this configuration,

- [00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=952) you need to set pre-trained model path. This is&nbsp; super important. The model links are posted here

- [00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=958) so you can either download them from here or I&nbsp; have a one-click downloader here. You see Windows

- [00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=963) download training models files. If you already&nbsp; have some of the models, make sure that they

- [00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=968) are accurate models or you will get errors. This&nbsp; bat file will download everything automatically

- [00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=974) for me. You see, it started downloading already.&nbsp; However, I already have them downloaded here. So

- [00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=979) I am going to just pick them. If you already have&nbsp; them, you can use them. We are going to use FLUX

- [00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=986) Dev version 23.8 gigabytes. The FP8 support also&nbsp; arrived, but I haven't tested it. So to be sure,

- [00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=994) use the FP16 version. It doesn't matter because we&nbsp; are going to use it in FP8 mode and training with

- [00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=1002) 24 gigabyte GPUs and it will cast the precision&nbsp; automatically. So select this. You see, this is

- [00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=1008) the base model that I have. Now selecting training&nbsp; images is super important and so many people are

- [00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=1015) making mistakes here. If you know how to set up&nbsp; Kohya folder structure, you can already set it up

- [00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=1021) yourself, but don't use it if you are not an&nbsp; expert. So in the dataset preparation section,

- [00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=1028) we are going to prepare our dataset. The dataset&nbsp; preparation is extremely important. I have written

- [00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=1035) some information here on how to caption them, how&nbsp; to crop them. I already have an auto cropper and

- [00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=1042) auto resize script, but you can also manually&nbsp; auto crop and auto resize them. So currently my

- [00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=1049) training images are auto cropped and auto resized&nbsp; to 1024 pixels as you are seeing right now. These

- [00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=1056) scripts that you will find are extremely useful.&nbsp; Watch this video and check out this script to

- [00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=1061) automatically crop the subject with focus and&nbsp; then resize to get your training dataset. Once

- [00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=1067) you have your dataset like this, copy the path of&nbsp; this dataset or you can also select the path from

- [00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=1074) here. You see training images directory. Click&nbsp; this icon, go to the folder like this and select

- [00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=1080) the folder like this. Now this is super important:&nbsp; repeating. What does repeating mean? We are going

- [00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=1087) to set the repeating to 1 because we are not&nbsp; going to use classification / regularization images.

- [00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=1093) I have tested the impact of regularization and&nbsp; classification images. You can see the results in

- [00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=1097) this research post. For example, let's open this&nbsp; post and no matter what I have tried, there is no

- [00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=1105) way to improve the likeness and the quality with&nbsp; classification regularization images. In none of

- [00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=1111) the cases it yielded better results. When I have&nbsp; used the classification regularization images,

- [00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=1118) you see, you will get mixed faces like this. And&nbsp; if you still want to know what does repeat means,

- [00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=1125) there is a link here. Open this link. In this&nbsp; link, I have asked Kohya to explain the logic

- [00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=1133) of repeating. The logic of repeating is initially&nbsp; made to balance imbalanced datasets. What does

- [00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=1140) that mean? Let's say you have 5 concepts that&nbsp; you want to train at once. And one of the concepts

- [00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=1146) has 100 training images. The other one has 20&nbsp; images. The other one has 30 images. So in machine

- [00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=1152) learning, you would like to make datasets balanced&nbsp; as much as equally trained. Therefore, if you have

- [00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=1159) 100 training images, you make the repeating 1.&nbsp; And for other concepts, if there are 20 images,

- [00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=1165) you make the repeating 5 of that concept.&nbsp; However, since I am training a single concept

- [00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=1171) right now, I am going to set repeating 1 and I&nbsp; am not going to use regularization images because

- [00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=1177) for FLUX training, it doesn't improve the results.&nbsp; However, when you train Stable Diffusion 1.5 or

- [00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=1184) Stable Diffusion XL (SDXL), it really improves the&nbsp; quality of training. At the end of this tutorial,

- [00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=1191) I will show you how to load the very best&nbsp; configuration for SD1.5 and SDXL and train

- [00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=1198) them. Don't worry about that. So we did set the&nbsp; training images directory here. We are going to

- [00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=1203) set the instance prompt. I am going to use&nbsp; a rare token ohwx because it contains very

- [00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=1209) little knowledge. Also, with FLUX training, it is&nbsp; not as important as before, but still use it. And

- [00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=1216) as a class prompt, I am going to use "man." Even&nbsp; if you don't use a class prompt, since the FLUX

- [00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=1223) model has an internal system that behaves like&nbsp; a text encoder and automatic captioning, it will

- [00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=1230) still know what you are training like you have&nbsp; fully captioned it. So even if you don't provide

- [00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=1236) any instance prompt or class prompt, it will work&nbsp; with FLUX. I have also tested it. In the research

- [00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=1243) topic you will see the training results with ohwx&nbsp; man, with only ohwx, and with only man. And you

- [00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=1252) will see that almost in all cases, it perfectly&nbsp; generates your concept. Still, I find it a little

- [00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=1260) bit better to set the class prompt as "man" or if&nbsp; you are training a woman, it's "woman." If you are

- [00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=1265) training a car, it's "car." If you are training&nbsp; a style, it's "style." But training for a man,

- [00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=1270) I use "man." Even if you don't use it, it will&nbsp; work. If you are training multiple people in one

- [00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=1276) training, you don't need to set a class prompt.&nbsp; Just give each one of them a rare token like ohwx,

- [00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=1283) like bbuk, and other rare tokens that you can&nbsp; decide yourself, and train all of them at once.

- [00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=1290) But currently, this is for single-person training.&nbsp; So this is the setup. Instance prompt, class

- [00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=1295) prompt, and destination directory. This is super&nbsp; important. The Kohya GUI will prepare the correct

- [00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=1301) folders and save them at that destination. So I am&nbsp; going to use the installed folder like here. You

- [00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=1308) can use anywhere, and I will save train images&nbsp; like this and then click prepare training data

- [00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=1315) and watch the CMD. You will see that it is done&nbsp; creating the Kohya SS training folder structure.

- [00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=1321) When you enter inside that folder, you see the&nbsp; train images folder generated here. When I enter

- [00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=1327) inside it, you see there is an image and inside&nbsp; the image, there is 1_ohwx man. So what does this

- [00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=1335) mean? This means that the one is the repeating.&nbsp; This is super important. If you set this to 100,

- [00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=1341) at every epoch, it will repeat 100 times. So this&nbsp; is super important. Kohya will always read the

- [00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=1347) repeating number from here, and the rest will be&nbsp; simply the caption of my images. If I wanted to

- [00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=1354) caption them, I could caption them, and it will&nbsp; read the captions. If you don't caption your

- [00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=1359) images, it will read the folder name as a caption.&nbsp; So let's also make a captioned example. I will

- [00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=1365) copy and paste this like this. The name of this&nbsp; folder will not be important because I'm going to

- [00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=1369) caption it. So copy this path, and for captioning,&nbsp; I have an amazing application called Joy Caption.

- [00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=1374) Click here. When you get to this post, you will&nbsp; see the installer for Joy Captioning. This is a

- [00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=1380) very advanced application. It supports multi&nbsp; GPU captioning as well because I am going to

- [00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=1386) caption my entire regularization images dataset,&nbsp; and I am going to make a LoRA on that. There will

- [00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=1392) be a total of 20,000 images that I am going to&nbsp; caption. So it supports multi GPU and also batch

- [00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=1399) captioning. It is already installed. Let me open&nbsp; it and show you how to caption. So Joy Caption 1.

- [00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=1405) Let's start the Windows application. Let's start&nbsp; like this. The application started. All I need

- [00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=1411) to do is give the input folder path here and just&nbsp; start batch captioning. You can decide on multiple

- [00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=1419) GPUs, multiple batch sizes. All is working.&nbsp; This is a very optimized application. There

- [00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=1423) is an override existing caption file, append&nbsp; new caption file, and max new tokens. You don't

- [00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=1429) need to set these parameters. You can just change&nbsp; the max new tokens. I'm going to make a dedicated

- [00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=1434) tutorial for this application hopefully later. You&nbsp; can see the progress on the CMD here. So first it

- [00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=1441) is loading the checkpoints to start captioning.&nbsp; The captioning started and it is captioning the

- [00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=1447) files. When I enter inside this file, you will&nbsp; see that it is generating captions like this. When

- [00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=1452) you open the text file, you will see the caption&nbsp; it generated for that image. However, if you do

- [00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=1459) captioning, it will reduce the likeness of your&nbsp; concept. If you are training a person or if you

- [00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=1466) are training similar stuff. Captioning with styles&nbsp; may work better. I am hopefully going to test it,

- [00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=1472) but still, if you want to do captioning,&nbsp; you can use this application to caption. I

- [00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=1477) have also compared the captioning effect. So let's&nbsp; search the caption in this post and let's see.

- [00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=1485) Yes, here the captioning results are here. Let's&nbsp; open it. And when we look at the caption results,

- [00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=1491) there will be a slightly reduced likeness.&nbsp; However, I didn't see improvement in the

- [00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=1498) environment or generalization or the overfitting.&nbsp; This is because it already captioned itself in the

- [00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=1506) FLUX architecture. So whether I caption or not, it&nbsp; doesn't matter much. The likeness is still there.

- [00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=1512) It's a little bit reduced and it doesn't improve&nbsp; the overall quality. So for person training,

- [00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=1518) I don't suggest captioning, but for training a&nbsp; style, it may work better. As I said, hopefully

- [00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=1523) I am going to research it and make a tutorial&nbsp; for style captioning. After you did the caption,

- [00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=1528) you still should add an activation token. What&nbsp; was the activation token? "instance prompt". So you

- [00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=1534) can either edit them manually or I have a caption&nbsp; editor. The caption editor is posted here. When

- [00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=1541) you go to this link, you will see the instructions&nbsp; and downloader zip file. It's a very, very

- [00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=1547) lightweight Gradio application. Let's open the&nbsp; image caption editor, start the application. It

- [00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=1553) doesn't use any GPU. It is just Python code that&nbsp; allows you to edit the images. It is web-based so

- [00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=1560) it can be used anywhere. So you need to enter the&nbsp; input folder path. This was our folder path. Let's

- [00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=1566) enter it and it will automatically refresh and&nbsp; scan the images. You see, these are the images.

- [00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=1570) When I click here, it will show me the caption.&nbsp; I can either manually edit it here like ohwx.

- [00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=1578) Then I can click save caption and it will save it.&nbsp; Then I can click the next image. Then I can filter

- [00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=1584) images by processed or unprocessed. This is an&nbsp; extremely useful application. So with processed,

- [00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=1590) you see this was the saved processed and these&nbsp; are the still waiting ones. This is a very,

- [00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=1595) very lightweight application. Let's make this&nbsp; again as "man" because I am going to show you

- [00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=1600) another thing. Let's save the caption. Then in&nbsp; the batch edit options, you can enter the folder

- [00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=1606) and you can replace words like replace "man" with&nbsp; "ohwx man" and replace all occurrences and it is

- [00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=1614) going to override all the files. Apply batch edit&nbsp; and all captions are edited. Then you can check

- [00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=1621) all the captions to see whether they contain my&nbsp; activation token or not like this check word and

- [00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=1627) you see all captions contain the specific word&nbsp; or phrase. Then when I refresh here and open

- [00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=1634) an image, you see this photograph features a&nbsp; "ohwx man standing." So all the captions are

- [00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=1640) now ready to use. Since this folder exists in&nbsp; my images folder, it will train both of them,

- [00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=1647) but we don't need captioned images now. So&nbsp; I'm just going to delete this folder. OK,

- [00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=1651) let's return back to the Gradio interface where we&nbsp; set up. After we clicked, prepare training data,

- [00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=1657) we also need to click "copy info to respective&nbsp; fields." Otherwise, you will see that the image

- [00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=1662) folder is not accurate. You see it is inaccurate.&nbsp; So click "copy info to respective fields" and you

- [00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=1668) will see that it did set the folder like this&nbsp; "train images img." So what does this mean? It

- [00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=1675) didn't give the path of this folder. It gives the&nbsp; parent folder path here so you can have multiple

- [00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=1682) concepts, multiple persons or items, anything&nbsp; inside this folder, and Kohya will read each one

- [00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=1690) of the folders and whether you have captioned&nbsp; them or you don't have captioned them, it will

- [00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=1695) read the folder name or the captions and it will&nbsp; train based on all of the images. You can also set

- [00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=1701) different repeating numbers for each concept, as I&nbsp; have explained. Let me show you. Let's say I have

- [00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=1707) 3 concepts. This can have 3 repeating.&nbsp; This can have 5 repeating. So the images inside

- [00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=1713) this one will be repeated 5 times. Images&nbsp; inside this one will be repeated 3 times.

- [00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=1717) This is the logic of setting up folders. Let's&nbsp; delete them. Now we have set the model path,

- [00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=1725) trained model output name, whatever the name you&nbsp; give, it will generate checkpoints with that name.

- [00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=1730) Let's say "Best_v2." OK, this will be&nbsp; the output model name for LoRAs that are going

- [00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=1738) to get generated. FLUX1 selected. Everything is&nbsp; selected. You don't need to set anything and you

- [00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=1743) don't need to use dataset preparation again, but&nbsp; you can prepare multiple datasets by using here.

- [00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=1749) With Stable Diffusion XL and with Stable Diffusion&nbsp; 1.5, we use regularization images. At the end

- [00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=1755) of this tutorial, I will show that too. So I'm just&nbsp; skipping that part. And the parameters. In the parameters what you

- [00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=1761) need to set are a few things. First of all, how&nbsp; many epochs you are going to train? We are going

- [00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=1768) to train based on epochs and one epoch means&nbsp; that all of the images are trained one time.

- [00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=1775) When we use regularization images, we use a&nbsp; different strategy. We train 200 repeating and

- [00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=1781) 1 epoch. But since we don't use regularization&nbsp; images and since we use 1 repeating, we are

- [00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=1786) going to use epoch strategy. So if you have 100&nbsp; images, you can reduce this epoch number. However,

- [00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=1793) you can still train up to 200 epochs and compare&nbsp; checkpoints to get the very best checkpoint. So as

- [00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=1799) you increase the number of images for a single&nbsp; concept, you may want to reduce the number of

- [00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=1804) epochs. Currently, most people will collect like&nbsp; 15 to 25 training images, maybe 50. So training

- [00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=1811) up to 200 epochs and comparing checkpoints is&nbsp; the best strategy. About the training dataset:

- [00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=1817) this training dataset is not great. Why? Because&nbsp; it contains the same clothing, same background

- [00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=1825) environment, and it is lacking expressions. Many&nbsp; people are asking me how to generate expressions.

- [00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=1831) If you want to generate expressions, you need&nbsp; to have expressions, emotions in your training

- [00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=1837) dataset. I am preparing a much better training&nbsp; dataset. It is not ready yet. I am still using

- [00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=1843) the same dataset so I can compare it with my older&nbsp; trainings. However, hopefully I will make another

- [00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=1849) video for an amazing training dataset. You will&nbsp; see that. So when you are preparing your training

- [00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=1854) dataset, have different poses, have different&nbsp; distances like full body shots, close shots, have

- [00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=1860) different expressions that you want to generate&nbsp; like laughing or crying, whatever you want, have

- [00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=1866) different clothing and have different backgrounds.&nbsp; The quality of the dataset is very important. With

- [00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=1872) FLUX, it is still very flexible. It is better than&nbsp; the SDXL or SD 1.5. However, as you improve your

- [00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=1879) dataset, you will get better results. One another&nbsp; thing is that make sure that your dataset has

- [00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=1884) excellent focus, sharpness, and lighting. This&nbsp; is also very important. Do not take pictures at

- [00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=1891) nighttime. So make sure that your images have&nbsp; very good lighting, very good focus, and very

- [00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=1896) good sharpness. OK, let's return back to Kohya&nbsp; GUI. So I will leave this at 200. You can reduce

- [00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=1902) this based on the number of images you have, how&nbsp; many checkpoints you want to get. You can make

- [00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=1907) this like 10, and after every 10 epochs, it will&nbsp; generate a checkpoint. And at the end of training,

- [00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=1913) you can compare all of them. I am going to show&nbsp; you how to use and compare them. There is no issue

- [00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=1918) with it. So you can make this 10 and compare all&nbsp; the checkpoints and find the very best checkpoint

- [00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=1924) you liked. So this is the most optimal way of&nbsp; obtaining the very best model and checkpoint.

- [00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=1931) But for this one, let's leave this as 25. Caption&nbsp; file extension. If you are going to use captions

- [00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=1938) instead of the folder names, you need to select&nbsp; the correct caption extension. By default,

- [00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=1943) it is TXT and TXT is the most used one. You can&nbsp; also use caption and cap. I never used them.

- [00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=1949) TXT is just working fine for me. Then you don't&nbsp; need to change anything else here. By default,

- [00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=1955) we are using 128 to 128 network rank. OK, this&nbsp; is another thing that you need to set. This is

- [00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=1962) super important: VAE path. So for VAE path, we set&nbsp; this ae.safetensors file. It is already downloaded.

- [00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=1971) Let's go to the folder, which was inside here. I&nbsp; had downloaded here and ae.safetensors file. And we

- [00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=1978) are going to use clip large model. Click here.&nbsp; Let's go to the clip large. OK, it is also set

- [00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=1984) and we are going to use T5 XXL. Make sure to use&nbsp; T5 XXL FP16. It will be auto cast to the correct

- [00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=1992) position. So let's also pick that file from our&nbsp; downloaded folder, which is here. And we are all

- [00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=2000) set. You don't need to do anything else. Just&nbsp; save the configuration wherever you want. So I

- [00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=2006) will save the downloaded folder by clicking this&nbsp; save. If you want to reload, you click this or

- [00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=2011) click refresh to reload. You see the refresh will&nbsp; refresh. You can also re-pick, but sometimes when

- [00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=2016) you re-pick, it may not refresh. So click this&nbsp; to refresh. Let's select the saved config again,

- [00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=2022) which was this one. And let's refresh. Yes, I can&nbsp; see the configuration reloaded. Currently, none of

- [00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=2028) the configurations are training text encoder clip&nbsp; large. As I said, I am researching it right now,

- [00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=2034) and hopefully I will update the configuration&nbsp; according to it. The training of clip large will

- [00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=2039) increase the VRAM usage slightly. It increased&nbsp; by like 800 megabytes on 16-bit precision.

- [00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=2046) It will also slow down slightly. You see from&nbsp; 8.82 seconds IT to 8.56 seconds IT on a 16-bit

- [00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=2056) precision training on a 6000 GPU. OK. As I said,&nbsp; we are ready. And before clicking start training,

- [00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=2064) you need to check your VRAM usage. Try to make&nbsp; your VRAM usage under 500 megabytes. Currently,

- [00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=2071) you see my computer is using 3.5 gigabytes. Why?&nbsp; Because I am running OBS studio. I am running

- [00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=2078) NVIDIA broadcast and some other applications. So&nbsp; try to reduce your VRAM usage to 500 megabytes if

- [00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=2085) you are on limited VRAM. How can you reduce it?&nbsp; Go to the startup, disable all of the startups,

- [00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=2091) restart your computer, and check the performance&nbsp; and GPU and see how much VRAM you are

- [00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=2098) using. Alternatively, you can also use another&nbsp; application, which is nvitop. So to install

- [00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=2105) nvitop, pip install nvitop. I already have&nbsp; it done. Type nvitop and it will show you

- [00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=2112) the VRAM usage, GPU utilization, how many GPUs&nbsp; you have. You see I have two GPUs. So this is

- [00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=2118) the way of also seeing exact VRAM usage.&nbsp; You see this one shows 3.8 gigabytes I am

- [00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=2125) using. This one is showing 3.5 dedicated GPU&nbsp; I am using. So you can use either way. Then

- [00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=2130) click start training and watch the progress&nbsp; on the CMD window of the Kohya. You see it is

- [00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=2137) starting everything. You should read the messages&nbsp; appearing here. If you see this error, xFormers

- [00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=2144) can't load. It is not an issue. Currently, we are&nbsp; not training xFormers. Actually, I had fixed this,

- [00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=2149) but I am going to fix it again. But it is not an&nbsp; issue because currently xFormers is not working

- [00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=2154) better than the default cross-attention, which is&nbsp; sdpa. I will also fix xFormers later, but you can

- [00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=2161) ignore this xFormers message. It doesn't make any&nbsp; difference. We are not using xFormers. So what are

- [00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=2167) the messages we see here? This is important.&nbsp; You see it has found 1 repeat. It has found

- [00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=2173) 15 images. So one epoch will be 15 steps because&nbsp; the batch size is 1. Increasing the batch size,

- [00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=2181) I have tested it too. It doesn't bring almost any&nbsp; speed gain. And as you increase the batch size,

- [00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=2187) you will get lesser quality training. Batch sizes&nbsp; should be used only for speed. And in this case,

- [00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=2195) it doesn't increase much. But you can use multiple&nbsp; GPUs to get almost linear speed increase. I have

- [00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=2201) explained the batch size in the Patreon post. So&nbsp; read that section and you see the regularization

- [00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=2207) factor is 1. Total steps 15. Train batch size&nbsp; is 1. Gradient accumulation steps 1 and 200

- [00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=2212) epochs. So it calculates the number of total&nbsp; steps, which is 15 divided by 1 divided by

- [00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=2218) 1. Why? Because this is the batch size. This is&nbsp; the gradient accumulation steps multiplied by 200.

- [00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=2224) This is the number of epochs and multiplied&nbsp; by 1. This is the regularization images,

- [00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=2229) which we don't use. So it is 1. When you use&nbsp; it, it is 2. And total, it will be 3000 steps.

- [00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=2236) I hit enter because when you touch the CMD, it&nbsp; will pause the CMD window. And you will also

- [00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=2242) see that it didn't find any captions. It didn't&nbsp; find regularization images. So it is going to

- [00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=2247) use class tokens or ohwx man, which it reads from&nbsp; the folder name. So everything is looking good.

- [00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=2254) And it will load and start training. The speed is&nbsp; not very great. And you will get better speed as

- [00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=2259) it progresses. In the beginning, it will show not&nbsp; an accurate speed. Once the Torch 2.4.1 published,

- [00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=2268) we should get speed like 4 to 5 seconds IT on&nbsp; Windows with an RTX 3090 GPU. But as I said,

- [00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=2275) don't worry, I'm going to make cloud tutorials.&nbsp; And it is going to be super fast on cloud GPUs.

- [00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=2281) You will be able to rent very powerful GPUs.&nbsp; And it is perfectly trainable. So this is how

- [00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=2286) we do training on Windows. It will be the same on&nbsp; Massed Compute and RunPod as well. The procedure

- [00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=2292) will be the same. Just the starting and installation&nbsp; will not be the same. So just wait until these

- [00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=2298) checkpoints are saved. And how are we going to use&nbsp; them afterward? Since I already have trained them,

- [00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=2305) I am not going to wait for training. In this&nbsp; repository, I have the training files, which is

- [00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=2311) trained with exactly the same configuration.&nbsp; You see the Best_v2. So I'm going

- [00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=2317) to download several checkpoints to test on my&nbsp; computer. When you are training, there is one

- [00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=2322) thing that is extremely important that you have&nbsp; to be careful of. Open the task manager, go to

- [00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=2328) the performance tab, and go to your GPU. You see&nbsp; that there is dedicated GPU and shared GPU memory.

- [00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=2336) When you are doing training, if it uses shared&nbsp; memory, it will become slower like 10 times,

- [00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=2344) 20 times. So this is the criterion that you need&nbsp; to be careful of. Compare the shared GPU memory

- [00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=2350) usage before starting the training and during the&nbsp; training and make sure that it doesn't use more

- [00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=2357) shared GPU during the training. If it does, then&nbsp; you will have extremely slow training speeds. This

- [00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=2364) is really important. This is also valid for all of&nbsp; the AI applications you use, like Swarm UI, like

- [00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=2372) Forge Web UI, like Automatic1111 Web UI, whatever that&nbsp; comes to your mind. When it starts using shared

- [00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=2378) VRAM, that will make your application slower like&nbsp; 20 times because it will start using the memory of

- [00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=2386) my computer and the memory of my computer will&nbsp; be way slower than the GPU memory. Moreover,

- [00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=2392) if you have low RAM in some applications, you may&nbsp; encounter a problem, but it is not an issue. You

- [00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=2399) can set virtual RAM memory. So you see currently I&nbsp; am training and I am not using any shared VRAM. My

- [00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=2406) dedicated GPU memory still has space to go like&nbsp; 3 gigabytes. This is super important. And

- [00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=2412) about RAM memory, you can set virtual RAM to have&nbsp; more RAM memory. Memory is usually important when

- [00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=2420) it is first time loading. So if you have limited&nbsp; RAM, you can increase the virtual RAM memory to

- [00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=2425) avoid any errors. To increase the virtual RAM&nbsp; memory, click this PC. In here, click this PC

- [00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=2432) properties. It will open these properties. In&nbsp; here, go to the advanced system settings. And

- [00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=2437) in this screen, you will see the settings in the&nbsp; performance. And in here, go to the advanced and

- [00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=2443) you see I have virtual memory. Change it. Set one&nbsp; of your fast drives and you can set a custom size.

- [00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=2450) Currently, my virtual RAM memory is set here.&nbsp; You see system-managed size and it will allocate

- [00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=2457) as necessary as virtual RAM memory. OK, this&nbsp; is the way of it. So during the training,

- [00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=2463) you will see that it will save checkpoints like&nbsp; this. And you will see their saved locations and

- [00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=2471) where they will be saved. They will be saved in&nbsp; the outputs folder. You see the output directory

- [00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=2479) for trained model. This was automatically set&nbsp; by the GUI when we used the prepared training data

- [00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=2488) and copied info to the respective fields. After&nbsp; you clicked "copy info to respective fields," you

- [00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=2494) can change the output directory for training the&nbsp; model. You can directly give the folder path of

- [00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=2500) your Swarm UI, your Forge web UI, wherever you&nbsp; are using your Comfy UI. So my models will be

- [00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=2506) saved automatically here. When we open that&nbsp; folder, we will see the saved checkpoints like

- [00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=2513) this. So these checkpoints are 2.4 gigabytes.&nbsp; Why? Because the FLUX model is very big. It

- [00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=2520) has 12 billion parameters. Moreover, we are&nbsp; saving it as float. So we are saving it with

- [00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=2528) the maximum precision without any quality&nbsp; loss. If you want to reduce the file size,

- [00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=2534) you can also save it as FP16. I haven't compared&nbsp; it. Some of the followers say that BF16 is working

- [00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=2542) badly. So if you need a lower size, save it as&nbsp; FP16. If you want to have the maximum accuracy,

- [00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=2549) save it as float. Saved precision will not&nbsp; change VRAM usage. Will not change the VRAM usage

- [00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=2557) during training or during inference. So now it is&nbsp; time to use the saved models with the FLUX model

- [00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=2564) itself. So how are we going to use them after&nbsp; training has been completed? You can use them with

- [00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=2570) Comfy UI, with Swarm UI, with Forge web UI at the&nbsp; moment. I prefer to use in Swarm UI. I already have

- [00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=2578) a main Swarm UI tutorial. It is amazing. And I&nbsp; also have a Swarm UI tutorial for FLUX. Moreover,

- [00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=2587) I also have a Forge web UI models downloader&nbsp; and installer for Runpod and also for Massed

- [00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=2593) Compute. I will show the cloud service providers&nbsp; in the cloud tutorial, but I will show how to use

- [00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=2601) it on my computer at the moment. So I will move&nbsp; these files into my Swarm UI models folder. You

- [00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=2608) see it also saves the TOML file and the JSON file&nbsp; wherever you are saving them. So let's select the

- [00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=2615) generated models and move them into our Swarm UI&nbsp; model folder. My Swarm UI is installed here. When

- [00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=2623) you watch the tutorial, you will see it. I will&nbsp; put the generated LoRA files into the models into

- [00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=2629) the LoRA folder here. This is important. This&nbsp; is where you need to put them. Before starting

- [00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=2634) training as I said, you can give this folder&nbsp; path. So after you have set the copy info to

- [00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=2642) respective fields, go here and change it like this&nbsp; and save your configuration. Then it will save the

- [00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=2649) generated LoRA files into this folder for you. OK,&nbsp; so I'm going to start my Swarm UI. First of all,

- [00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=2656) I am going to update it. When you are using Swarm&nbsp; UI, you should update it always. You can also use

- [00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=2662) Forge web UI or ComfyUI. I prefer Swarm UI because&nbsp; it is amazing. It has so many amazing features.

- [00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=2669) It also uses the back end of ComfyUI. So I will&nbsp; use the launch windows.bat file to start it.

- [00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=2675) And my ComfyUI is starting. There is also a trick&nbsp; that I'm going to show you. This will give you

- [00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=2681) a lot of performance boost. If you have an RTX&nbsp; 4000 series GPUs, click this pencil icon and add

- [00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=2689) extra arguments --fast here and save it. This will&nbsp; hugely speed up your generations with Swarm UI

- [00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=2697) when you are using the FLUX model. Backends&nbsp; are still loading. Go to the server,

- [00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=2701) go to the logs. Let's see in the debug. So we can&nbsp; see that it is starting the server. It is loading

- [00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=2707) everything and the data is getting refreshed. OK,&nbsp; so now I am ready to generate images. For the FLUX

- [00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=2713) model. I am going to use CFG scale 1. When you&nbsp; use CFG scale 1, you see the negative problem

- [00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=2718) is disabled because FLUX doesn't support. I prefer 30 steps. Based on your GPU,

- [00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=2724) you can set it. I'm going to use resolution 1.&nbsp; I'm going to use sampler Uni PC. I find this the

- [00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=2730) best. The scheduler will be normal and you can&nbsp; set the preferred D type here. Since this is a

- [00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=2735) 24-gigabyte GPU, I am going to use this one.&nbsp; However, you can also use 16-bit on a bigger

- [00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=2743) VRAM-having GPU. This is a good one. There are&nbsp; also quantized models, but I haven't tested LoRAs

- [00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=2750) on them, whether they are working or not. So I&nbsp; don't know. And I can't say they will work. And

- [00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=2756) in the models, I have FLUX 1 version dev FP8.&nbsp; You can also use the FP16 model. They should work

- [00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=2765) exactly the same actually. So to be sure, I am&nbsp; going to use the FP16 model. I already have it

- [00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=2772) here. So let's copy it. And let's copy it into our&nbsp; models folder. It goes into the Stable Diffusion.

- [00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=2782) Let's see. Yeah, it goes into the UNet because&nbsp; this is not a quantized model. It goes into the

- [00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=2787) UNet. The quantized models go into the Stable&nbsp; Diffusion folder in the Swarm UI. I could also

- [00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=2793) give the path of this file from this folder&nbsp; before doing the training. So you don't need

- [00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=2798) to have duplicate files. What would be the case?&nbsp; The case would be I click this icon. Then I go to

- [00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=2806) my Swarm UI installation, which is here. Swarm UI&nbsp; inside models, inside UNet. And I can select this.

- [00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=2815) So you see, you can give any file path in Kohya GUI.&nbsp; It will just work. Then refresh the models and the

- [00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=2823) FLUX development arrived. This is an FP16, 16-bit&nbsp; precision model. But since I'm going to use 8-bit,

- [00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=2830) it will auto-cast it. Before starting using the&nbsp; LoRA, let's generate an image. And a very good

- [00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=2837) part is that in the zip file, I have shared some&nbsp; test prompts. So let's open the test prompts from

- [00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=2843) here. And for example, let's generate this image&nbsp; without our LoRA. And let's hit generate. You can

- [00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=2849) watch the progress in the server, in the logs, in&nbsp; the debug. So it is going to load the model. And

- [00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=2856) you see model weight dtype, manual cast. So it is&nbsp; going to do everything automatically for me. I can

- [00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=2862) watch the VRAM usage here. It is using ComfyUI,&nbsp; thus it is very, very optimized. I have selected

- [00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=2869) the model. You see the FLUX 1 development model&nbsp; is selected. As I said, I am not sure whether it

- [00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=2874) is working with the quantized models or not. I&nbsp; haven't tested yet, but you can test. For now

- [00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=2880) make sure to test with the development model. Then&nbsp; you can test on quantized models as well. And this

- [00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=2885) is my VRAM usage currently. Don't worry, you don't&nbsp; need such VRAM. It works as low as 6 GB having

- [00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=2892) GPUs. It is extremely optimized. Since I have more&nbsp; VRAM, it is using more VRAM. When you have lower

- [00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=2899) VRAM, it will use lower VRAM. Moreover, I can also&nbsp; use my second GPU. It is amazing. So all I need to

- [00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=2907) do is I am going to add a new ComfyUI self-starting&nbsp; click here. OK. I will make this like this. Extra

- [00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=2915) arguments, starting script. And I will make this&nbsp; GPU ID 1 and save. So when I generate multiple

- [00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=2921) images, it will use my second GPU as well. OK. The&nbsp; image is almost ready. I am also using segment to

- [00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=2928) in-paint face. This is not mandatory. In the main&nbsp; tutorial, I explain everything. It is a little bit

- [00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=2934) slow on my GPU, but you can use the cloud always.&nbsp; We can see the IT per second. OK. Where is it?

- [00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=2941) Let's generate another image to see it. Let's also&nbsp; see. Yeah, it is fine. OK. Now it is starting to

- [00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=2947) in-paint the face. OK. Face in-painting speed&nbsp; is 1.5 seconds per IT. And it is doing 18 steps.

- [00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=2953) Why? Because I set it at 0.7 denoise strength.&nbsp; It is called different here. It is called image

- [00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=2962) creativity. So it is doing 70%. And since I use 30&nbsp; steps, it is doing 21. Actually, it should do 21,

- [00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=2971) but it did 18. OK. This is the image we got. Now&nbsp; I prefer to use FLUX guidance scale 4. I forgotten

- [00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=2979) that. OK. Then how am I going to use my LoRAs?&nbsp; Go to the LoRAs tab here, refresh. And once you

- [00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=2986) refresh, you will see your FLUX LoRAs. You see&nbsp; type FLUX 1 LoRAs. For example, let's use the

- [00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=2992) 150 epoch and hit generate. So now it is going&nbsp; to use my LoRA. We can see in the back end. It

- [00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=2999) will load. You can see everything here. Swarm&nbsp; UI working much better than the Forge web UI.

- [00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=3006) When you are using LoRAs, when you are using Forge&nbsp; web UI, it first processes LoRAs. It takes extra

- [00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=3012) VRAM. However, with Swarm UI, it doesn't do that.&nbsp; Also, when you have more VRAM, it will be faster.

- [00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=3018) Since I am using some serious VRAM right now. It&nbsp; is using a lot of VRAM. I am recording a video.

- [00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=3025) It is also making. And let's also close these two.&nbsp; Try to reduce your VRAM usage as much as possible.

- [00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=3032) And I am already using a lot of VRAM when I am&nbsp; recording. We can see the preview here. First,

- [00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=3037) it is generating the image. Then it will&nbsp; in-paint the face to my face with the prompt

- [00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=3042) photo of ohwx man. It is in-painting the face now.&nbsp; This is not mandatory but in-painting the face,

- [00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=3049) especially in distance shots, will improve the&nbsp; face quality. Moreover, in my training images,

- [00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=3056) I have eyeglasses. You see? But since FLUX&nbsp; has an internal text encoder, it is able

- [00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=3063) to separate my eyeglasses from my face. Thus, in&nbsp; this image, I don't have eyeglasses. This is also

- [00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=3070) a little bit overfit image. But I am working on&nbsp; a better workflow. Hopefully, I will update it.

- [00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=3075) and it will become much better. So you can add&nbsp; here with eyeglasses. And you will get a more

- [00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=3083) likely image. Let's see. Let's hit Generate and&nbsp; double-generate. So once I click it double times,

- [00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=3088) it will also start using my second GPU. It should&nbsp; start. Let's see. I think first it will load into

- [00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=3095) the second GPU. Then it will start. OK. Let's&nbsp; see the server back-ends. OK. OK. It shows here

- [00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=3101) running back-end. OK. For some reason, it didn't&nbsp; start. And if preview disappears here, you can go

- [00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=3107) to the image history, refresh. The last generated&nbsp; images will always appear here. You can see them,

- [00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=3112) their features. FLUX guidance scale, the LoRA. You&nbsp; can also set different LoRA weights from here. OK.

- [00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=3119) Image is generated. And you see it is now much&nbsp; more resembling. We can see from the training

- [00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=3126) images, it has a perfect resemblance. It is, as&nbsp; I said, more overfit. With the fine-tuning, full

- [00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=3133) model training I think this overfitting problem&nbsp; will be solved. I am also doing more research

- [00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=3138) right now, as I said. So I will update the config&nbsp; as I get better config. Every day something new is

- [00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=3144) arriving. Also, you may use overfit, over-trained&nbsp; model checkpoints. So how are we going to test

- [00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=3153) and find the very best checkpoint? This is a super&nbsp; important part. Let's see also the other generated

- [00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=3158) image. If you have an RTX 4090, it will be way&nbsp; faster than this. It will be many times faster

- [00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=3164) than this. You can always see the step speed here.&nbsp; It is around 1.5 seconds per IT for me. And the

- [00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=3169) second image also generated a perfect resemblance.&nbsp; OK. So how am I going to find the very best

- [00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=3175) checkpoint? To do that, we go to the Tools. And&nbsp; in here, we select the Grid Generator. In here,

- [00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=3183) in the first tab, I use LoRAs. So find the LoRAs&nbsp; from here. Let's find it. You can also type to

- [00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=3189) filter like this: LoRAs. When you click Fill,&nbsp; it will fill all the LoRAs. Then you can delete

- [00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=3195) the ones that you don't want to test. Let's start&nbsp; testing from the 50 epochs. So these are epochs,

- [00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=3200) epoch 50, epoch 75. If you save based on the&nbsp; step count, it will have a different naming. So

- [00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=3206) the last one will be the 200 epochs. Then you can&nbsp; test multiple prompts or you can use this prompt

- [00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=3212) for testing. If you want to test multiple prompts,&nbsp; I have already prepared prompts. So these prompts

- [00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=3219) are shared here. You see test prompts, no segment&nbsp; in-painting. This doesn't have any segmentation

- [00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=3225) in-painting. And I have test prompts here, test&nbsp; prompts with eyeglasses. And test prompts, let's

- [00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=3232) see. One of them doesn't have eyeglasses. OK, this&nbsp; doesn't have. So I am going to change this name.

- [00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=3239) I will fix this. Test prompts without eyeglasses,&nbsp; grid formatted. So you just copy this. By the way,

- [00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=3245) in the grid, this is the prompt separator. You see&nbsp; like this. Then copy-paste it here. You see it has

- [00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=3252) split each prompt. And now when I generate a grid,&nbsp; it will test all of the models for me. Let's see,

- [00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=3261) generate. This time it should use the second GPU&nbsp; as well, I believe. Let's see what will happen.

- [00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=3267) OK, now it started loading onto the second GPU as&nbsp; well. So when generating this grid, it will use

- [00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=3274) both of my GPUs. However, with my GPUs, this will&nbsp; take huge time because there are 274 generations.

- [00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=3283) This is estimated this will get better. But&nbsp; this will make a huge grid. You should wait for

- [00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=3289) it to update. You can rent for a 6000 on Massed&nbsp; Compute and use all of them at once. It will be

- [00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=3296) much faster. In the Massed Compute tutorial hopefully, I will show you. OK, the first

- [00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=3301) image is generated. The first image for verifying&nbsp; the model sanity. You see it is perfectly able to

- [00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=3308) generate a supercar image. Nothing like me. So the&nbsp; model sanity is perfect. It is still keeping its

- [00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=3315) sanity. And what kind of results are we going to&nbsp; get after these grids are generated? For now, I

- [00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=3322) will interrupt this with "interrupt all sessions."&nbsp; And I will show you from my cloud computing. So in

- [00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=3329) the Swarm UI Massed Compute tutorial, there are&nbsp; these new instructions. Copy this. First of all,

- [00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=3335) you need to install this. OK, let's copy this and&nbsp; open a new terminal here. New window and paste it

- [00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=3343) and hit enter. This will start Swarm UI on Massed&nbsp; Compute. But it will give me a cloud URL that I

- [00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=3351) can use on my computer. It will be here. It is&nbsp; Cloud Flare. Let's copy and paste it and open.

- [00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=3356) And this is where I do my testing, my&nbsp; experimentation. When I go to the tools and

- [00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=3362) grid generator, I have so many previous tests like&nbsp; this. You see, I have 8 GPUs running there.

- [00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=3369) For example, let's open one of them. OK, let's&nbsp; best new 150 epochs. And when I click here,

- [00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=3376) it will show me the grid results. I explain all&nbsp; of this in the main tutorial. In the advanced

- [00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=3382) settings, you can select to show which prompts you&nbsp; can select, which models to show. And we will get

- [00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=3389) a grid like this where we will be able to compare&nbsp; different checkpoints LoRAs. So by analyzing this grid,

- [00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=3397) you need to find your best liked checkpoint.&nbsp; Usually 150 is good, but it depends on your

- [00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=3405) training data set. So generate a grid, analyze&nbsp; all of the generated images. You will see at

- [00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=3412) the top the model used. Also, when you click&nbsp; the image in the bottom, you will see which

- [00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=3417) LoRA is used. For example, for this one, the used&nbsp; LoRA is. Let's see this one. Best v1_5e_05,

- [00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=3425) 150. Also, it shows the LoRA used name here.&nbsp; So this is the way of finding the very best

- [00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=3432) LoRA checkpoint that you have. For example, on&nbsp; this Massed Compute, I have 8 running GPUs

- [00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=3438) and I am able to generate ultra-fast images.&nbsp; This is how I do my experimentation. There

- [00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=3443) is no other way to do these many trainings on a&nbsp; single GPU. So you need to spend a considerable

- [00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=3449) amount of money. Thankfully, Massed Compute is&nbsp; supporting me. So if you are wondering how did

- [00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=3455) I generate those amazing pictures that I have&nbsp; shown in the intro, I have generated amazing

- [00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=3462) new prompts and I used the wild card feature&nbsp; of the Swarm UI and I have written all these

- [00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=3469) posts in this wild card and I have generated nine&nbsp; thousand nine hundred ninety-nine images until I

- [00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=3476) stopped it. The new prompts are shared in the test&nbsp; prompts in the 340 prompts used as wild cards. OK,

- [00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=3485) we have covered everything and there is also&nbsp; extra information here on how to train on and

- [00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=3491) use on Runpod and Massed Compute. The instructions&nbsp; are already included in the file. You will see

- [00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=3497) the Massed Compute, Kohya FLUX instructions. You&nbsp; will see RunPod install instructions. Hopefully,

- [00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=3503) I'm going to make separate tutorials for them.&nbsp; Also, I suggest you save your models on Hugging

- [00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=3509) Face if you want to save them. Download them fast.&nbsp; I have an amazing notebook and tutorial for that.

- [00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=3514) Watch it. And it is also asked of me how to do&nbsp; SDXL and SD 1.5 training with the newest Kohya

- [00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=3522) interface. So everything is the same, almost the&nbsp; same. Therefore, I will quickly show you. For

- [00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=3528) example, let's begin with SDXL. Let's open the&nbsp; best configuration. In the very top we will see

- [00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=3534) the configuration. Here. Let's download the Tier 1&nbsp; 24 gigabytes Slower V2. There is also a Tier 2

- [00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=3541) low VRAM version and the configuration loaded.&nbsp; Let's close the Swarm UI and let's open our latest

- [00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=3550) Kohya installation, which is here. Let's start it&nbsp; again. The configuration is downloaded. Kohya is

- [00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=3558) starting. OK, then these are full fine-tuning&nbsp; configurations, not for LoRA. So select the

- [00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=3567) DreamBooth app here. Go to the configuration.&nbsp; Click this icon. By the way, this is SD3 FLUX

- [00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=3573) branch. So there may be some errors. You need to&nbsp; install it the normal way. If it doesn't work,

- [00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=3580) I don't know. I didn't test it. So let's go to&nbsp; the downloads. Select the file and it is loaded.

- [00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=3586) You see this is DreamBooth. SDXL is selected.&nbsp; We do FP16 training. Now you set everything

- [00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=3592) exactly the same. Trained model. Output name.&nbsp; You put the image folder name. Pre-trained model

- [00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=3597) path. But this time what differs is you should use&nbsp; regularization images. And regularization images

- [01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=3604) are posted here. I have amazing 5200&nbsp; images for both women and men. So what

- [01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=3614) you do when you go to the dataset preparation,&nbsp; you also put regularization images and you put

- [01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=3621) 200 repeats or the number of repeating may depend on your number of training images.

- [01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=3626) Let's say you have 50 training images. Since&nbsp; we have 5000 regularization images,

- [01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=3632) you can make this 100 and you can train&nbsp; 2 epochs. But let's say I have 15. So I

- [01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=3638) make this repeating 200. Put my training&nbsp; images path here. Then I also go to the downloaded

- [01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=3646) regularization images. Let's see. For example,&nbsp; these are 768. I also

- [01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=3651) have 1024. Yeah,&nbsp; here. This is an amazing dataset. Super

- [01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=3656) high quality. I tested and compared the effect of&nbsp; using regularization images and it's mind-blowing,

- [01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=3662) especially with OneTrainer. And you put it&nbsp; here. This time repeating will be 1. You

- [01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=3667) just type ohwx and man it will auto-generate&nbsp; the folders for us with accurate naming. Let me

- [01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=3674) show you. So let's make the destination an example&nbsp; place like music folder D. Usually you shouldn't

- [01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=3680) use the users folder. But this is just for an&nbsp; example. Prepare training data. Watch the CMD

- [01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=3686) window because copying may take time. Wait until&nbsp; you see done. Currently it is copying everything.

- [01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=3692) We can see image 200 ohwx man is copied. And&nbsp; it is also going to copy man datasets. OK,

- [01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=3700) this one copied. And in the reg folder. OK, this&nbsp; one copied. You see the regularization images are

- [01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=3706) put into the reg folder and the training images&nbsp; are put into the image folder. And inside the reg

- [01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=3712) folder man images are named as 1 man because&nbsp; one repeat and man class token and the training

- [01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=3721) images are 200 and ohwx man. So what other thing&nbsp; changes? Now we train only 1 epoch. So how

- [01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=3728) are we going to save checkpoints in this case? To&nbsp; save checkpoints in this case, let's copy info to

- [01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=3733) the respective folders and let's also select the&nbsp; pre-trained model path. I have already models

- [01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=3739) here. Like let's see SDXL base, for example. By&nbsp; the way, which models I suggest. I suggest you use

- [01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=3751) Realistic Vision Version, RealVis XL 4 for training SDXL and for training&nbsp; SD 1.5. I suggest what was the name: Hyperrealism

- [01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=3760) version 3. So you should select those models.&nbsp; And when you click the print training command,

- [01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=3766) it will show you the total number of steps.&nbsp; And it is now 6000 because I have 15 training

- [01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=3773) images. I use regularization images and I have&nbsp; 200 repeating. Therefore, let's see if it does

- [01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=3779) show the calculation. Yes, 200 repeats, 15&nbsp; images. It makes 3000 steps per epoch. Since

- [01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=3786) regularization images are used, it is multiplied&nbsp; by 2. So total 6000 steps. And let's say I want

- [01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=3792) to save every 20 epochs. So normally it would be&nbsp; save every 20 epochs. But now I don't have that

- [01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=3800) option since I train 1 epoch. So I will save&nbsp; the number of steps. When you divide 6000 to 10,

- [01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=3808) because we want to get 10 checkpoints, you&nbsp; will change the save every N steps. Let's

- [01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=3815) see here. So if I make this 601, it will save as&nbsp; equal as saving every 20 epochs compared to the

- [01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=3825) repeat 1. This is the logic of it. This will&nbsp; save 10 checkpoints during the entire training.

- [01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=3830) And this save every N epochs is 1 and epoch is&nbsp; 1. This will save full checkpoints. For SDXL,

- [01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=3838) it will be over 6 GB. For SD1.5, it will be like,&nbsp; I don't remember actually, but it will be big. So

- [01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=3845) if you need LoRAs, do this way of DreamBooth&nbsp; fine-tuning training, then extract LoRA. It

- [01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=3852) will work much better than training LoRA with SDXL&nbsp; or SD1.5. I have tested it. For extracting LoRA,

- [01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=3860) I have an amazing post here. It shows how you&nbsp; can extract. Let me also show you quickly. Go

- [01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=3865) to the Utilities. Go to the LoRA. And in here, you&nbsp; will see Extract LoRA. Whether it is SDXL or not,

- [01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=3872) you pick it here. If you don't pick SDXL, it&nbsp; will extract as SD1.5. If you pick SDXL, it will

- [01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=3880) extract as SDXL. Currently, it doesn't support&nbsp; FLUX. I don't see it here. Oh, here, click here.

- [01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=3887) Extract LoRA also arrived. I haven't tested it&nbsp; yet. I will hopefully test it after I train full

- [01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=3893) fine-tuning. So select your fine-tuned model. This&nbsp; is the generated model. Select the base model.

- [01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=3898) This is like RealVis XL 4. Set the path where&nbsp; you want to save. Save precision. You can save

- [01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=3904) as float. It will double the size. Load precision.&nbsp; You can load as float. Set this minimum difference

- [01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=3909) 00001. So it will also save the text encoder because&nbsp; I train the text encoder as well. And you can

- [01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=3915) set the network dimension 128 to 128. This is&nbsp; it. For SDXL, you just select SDXL. And that is

- [01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=3923) the way of extracting LoRAs and using them when&nbsp; you do training with SD1.5 and SDXL. In my post,

- [01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=4034) been wondering. Hopefully, see you in the future&nbsp; tutorials for FLUX because a lot of tutorials

- [01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=4040) are coming like training on Runpod, training&nbsp; on Massed Compute, and fine-tuning. I think

- [01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=4046) fine-tuning will be way better. And I am going&nbsp; to update this post and write the very newest

- [01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=4053) findings that I have. Also, you should check out&nbsp; this lengthy research post because you will find

- [01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=4060) a lot of information here. Let me show you one&nbsp; thing. For example, FLUX training discussions

- [01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=4065) with lots of information on this post. You can&nbsp; open them. And there is new information that

- [01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=4072) shows why Windows training is currently slower&nbsp; than Linux training. With Torch 2.4.1 hopefully,

- [01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=4080) we are going to get an amazing speed boost&nbsp; on Windows without doing anything and without

- [01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=4085) losing any quality. And it is 75% completed. So&nbsp; it is almost there. I will update my installer

- [01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nySGu12Y05k&t=4092) scripts. Don't worry about that. Hopefully,&nbsp; see you in another amazing tutorial video.
