If your Davinci Resolve became very slow after upgrading to version 19, here the solution for it under 1 minute. It was very frustrating for me until I have figured out what is the problem. Enjoy the new amazing speed of Davinci Resolve 19. Editing Kohya GUI Ultimate FLUX LoRA training tutorial at the moment.

- [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WnHqhb6ys8&t=0) If you have upgraded to DaVinci Resolve version&nbsp; 19 and your workflow has become very slow,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WnHqhb6ys8&t=7) your video editing has become very slow, the&nbsp; reason is that now with the latest update,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WnHqhb6ys8&t=13) DaVinci Resolve uses Prefer Camera Originals as&nbsp; a default instead of using your proxies. So even&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WnHqhb6ys8&t=21) though I had generated proxies, it was extremely&nbsp; slow. And I didn't know the reason until I found&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WnHqhb6ys8&t=28) out that the Prefer Proxies option added here&nbsp; and it is not using it by default. Therefore,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WnHqhb6ys8&t=34) it was very slow. So click here and set&nbsp; Prefer Proxies and you will get back&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WnHqhb6ys8&t=40) to your original amazing speed. Actually,&nbsp; DaVinci Resolve 19 is faster than the older&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WnHqhb6ys8&t=47) versions if you are a free user like me. So&nbsp; upgrade and select the Prefer Proxies.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WnHqhb6ys8&t=52) And I am editing the Kohya SS GUI FLUX LoRA&nbsp; training tutorial. It is a very long tutorial.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WnHqhb6ys8&t=60) It is taking time, but hopefully it&nbsp; will be published very soon today.
