### Video Transcription


- [00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=3) Hello everyone,

- [00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=8) welcome to our 13th software engineering course today.

- [00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=13) The topics covered in the software engineering section are as follows: redundancy and diversity.

- [00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=16) redundancy and diversity. Basic approaches to achieving fault tolerance.

- [00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=18) Basic approaches to achieving fault tolerance. Reliable processes are given.

- [00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=21) Reliable processes are given. How processes can be used to perform tasks in systems.

- [00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=24) How processes can be used to perform tasks in systems. System architectures.

- [00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=28) System architectures. Architectural models for software fault tolerance

- [00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=30) Architectural models for software fault tolerance are given.

- [00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=34) are given. Programming guidelines for preventing errors

- [00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=38) Programming guidelines for preventing errors were given. Software can be trusted.

- [00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=41) were given. Software can be trusted. Generally, software customers

- [00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=44) Generally, software customers generally expect all written

- [00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=47) generally expect all written software to be secure.

- [00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=49) software to be secure. If

- [00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=50) If you're buying software or

- [00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=53) you're buying software or writing it from scratch, you expect this section to be secure.

- [00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=55) writing it from scratch, you expect this section to be secure. However, for non-critical applications,

- [00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=58) However, for non-critical applications, some system errors

- [00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=60) some system errors may be acceptable. This is quite possible.

- [00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=63) may be acceptable. This is quite possible. Some applications have

- [00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=66) Some applications have high security

- [00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=68) high security requirements, not critical systems, and

- [00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=71) requirements, not critical systems, and special software engineering

- [00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=73) special software engineering techniques can be used to achieve this. So, in which

- [00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=76) techniques can be used to achieve this. So, in which critical systems is this necessary? Why is this necessary in

- [00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=78) critical systems is this necessary? Why is this necessary in medical systems? Because if an error occurs,

- [00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=81) medical systems? Because if an error occurs, human life and health are at stake.

- [00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=84) human life and health are at stake. Telecommunications and power systems. If

- [00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=87) Telecommunications and power systems. If communication is interrupted or power

- [00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=89) communication is interrupted or power is cut off, it can cause very serious problems.

- [00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=93) is cut off, it can cause very serious problems. Even electricity, for example,

- [00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=95) Even electricity, for example,

- [00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=101) can cause fires and other things. If space systems fail and a critical error occurs, it

- [00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=102) systems fail and a critical error occurs, it

- [00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=110) will be quite difficult to fix it. Because it's quite difficult to intervene in space, as you know,

- [00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=113) quite difficult to intervene in space, as you know, sometimes they do spacewalks or

- [00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=116) sometimes they do spacewalks or there's no battery station. And an autonomous system, you

- [00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=119) there's no battery station. And an autonomous system, you

- [00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=123) will never have the opportunity for physical intervention. In this way,

- [00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=128) this way, let's see in which cases the reliability success is

- [00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=132) let's see in which cases the reliability success is successful. If we pay the same error prevention, it is

- [00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=135) successful. If we pay the same error prevention, it is a success you can trust.

- [00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=137) a success you can trust. This system has been developed to avoid human error

- [00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=140) This system has been developed to avoid human error and thus

- [00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=142) and thus minimize system failures.

- [00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=145) minimize system failures. This way, errors occur

- [00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=147) This way, errors occur

- [00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=154) during the development process. It is designed to detect and repair system failures before they are delivered to the customer. In other words,

- [00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=162) we will organize the development process in such a way that we will detect

- [00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=163) we will detect errors and correct them before they are delivered to the customer.

- [00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=166) errors and correct them before they are delivered to the customer. Another element is fault detection,

- [00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=169) Another element is fault detection, verification, and validation. Here, what is

- [00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=174) verification, and validation. Here, what is Validation? Byndo application.

- [00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=180) Validation? Byndo application. And what should we say here before, what we said is

- [00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=196) verification and validation. Now, verification and validation techniques are used to detect and eliminate

- [00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=199) verification and validation techniques are used to detect and eliminate errors in a system before they are implemented. This is

- [00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=201) errors in a system before they are implemented. This is

- [00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=210) a fault tolerance system. This system is always

- [00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=212) always

- [00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=219) designed so that errors in the software from the slime will not cause system failures. So, for example, you add a global error detection system to the

- [00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=221) error detection system to the system.

- [00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=224) system. Even if a failure occurs, this

- [00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=226) Even if a failure occurs, this minimizes grease. This is both fishy. In other words, the system

- [00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=232) minimizes grease. This is both fishy. In other words, the system

- [00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=238) uses LO without causing a message crash, and the system continues to work, restarts automatically.

- [00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=239) restarts automatically. Think about it now. The

- [00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=244) Think about it now. The increasing costs of troubleshooting are increasing.

- [00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=247) increasing costs of troubleshooting are increasing. What does "failure" mean? Recep Rezil, the

- [00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=251) What does "failure" mean? Recep Rezil, the rezil year error, that is,

- [00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=257) rezil year error, that is, you detect the main failures, but

- [00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=258) you detect the main failures, but if you want to detect such rare failures,

- [00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=261) if you want to detect such rare failures, you can. What happens to us? Friends, the

- [00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=265) you can. What happens to us? Friends, the cost of this increases. That's why,

- [00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=269) cost of this increases. That's why, after a certain point, the cost increases very quickly and

- [00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=270) after a certain point, the cost increases very quickly and very much, and from there, you no

- [00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=274) very much, and from there, you no longer seek to fix subsequent errors.

- [00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=276) longer seek to fix subsequent errors.

- [00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=286) This means that if this error occurs, you take the risk of the consequences of the error. This means that we can add what the cost is,

- [00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=291) we can add what the cost is, and even systems that are natural

- [00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=295) and even systems that are natural critical systems are regulated systems,

- [00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=298) critical systems are regulated systems, which means that their use must be approved by

- [00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=301) which means that their use must be approved by an external regulator before entering service.

- [00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=303) an external regulator before entering service.

- [00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=308) For example, there are nuclear systems,

- [00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=310) systems, but air traffic control systems, medical

- [00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=312) but air traffic control systems, medical devices, 300

- [00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=315) devices, 300 systems that directly affect human health. So,

- [00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=319) systems that directly affect human health. So, these and systems that are

- [00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=323) these and systems that are approved by a regulator

- [00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=324) approved by a regulator

- [00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=335) must be approved by the regulator. Therefore, we must establish a wing to claim that a critical system development system is

- [00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=337) development system is reliable, safe, and secure.

- [00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=339) reliable, safe, and secure.

- [00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=350) That is, the regulator and the regulator. More precisely, the commission must be convinced that the system

- [00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=354) More precisely, the commission must be convinced that the system is safe, reliable, and secure.

- [00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=356) is safe, reliable, and secure. That's why the system should be

- [00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=358) That's why the system should be developed in this way.

- [00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=362) developed in this way. If it can be included, a nice reporting of your voices

- [00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=365) If it can be included, a nice reporting of your voices and the results

- [00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=368) and the results you add here. This is famous.

- [00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=370) you add here. This is famous. This trust, reliability, success,

- [00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=373) This trust, reliability, success, what can we say? Methods that increase mother.

- [00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=377) what can we say? Methods that increase mother. Isn't it my fault? It already has rules like fault detection and error detection.

- [00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=380) Isn't it my fault? It already has rules like fault detection and error detection. Because

- [00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=383) Because it's a system that's built here,

- [00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=385) it's a system that's built here, you have to follow those rules. Diversity and

- [00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=389) you have to follow those rules. Diversity and redundancy are critical. Let's combine them and

- [00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=394) redundancy are critical. Let's combine them and have multiple versions ready.

- [00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=396) have multiple versions ready. So, if one fails, it

- [00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=398) So, if one fails, it can be used somewhere.

- [00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=400) can be used somewhere. We've said before, for example, there are multiple systems in airplanes. There are

- [00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=403) We've said before, for example, there are multiple systems in airplanes. There are two main systems,

- [00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=406) two main systems, then subsystems, emergency

- [00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=408) then subsystems, emergency systems, and these are developed independently of each other.

- [00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=410) systems, and these are developed independently of each other.

- [00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=415) If one doesn't work, the other one takes over. For example, if an airplane's engine fails, the

- [00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=418) For example, if an airplane's engine fails, the blades

- [00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=421) blades are designed to land with the other engine. These are all redundancy,

- [00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=426) are designed to land with the other engine. These are all redundancy, diversity, and diversity. These provide the same functionality in different

- [00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=428) diversity, and diversity. These provide the same functionality in different ways. So, they

- [00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=430) ways. So, they don't fail at the same time. I

- [00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=435) don't fail at the same time. I mentioned this. For example, the airplane's main system

- [00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=438) mentioned this. For example, the airplane's main system was developed in two copies, but the second copy is developed

- [00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=440) was developed in two copies, but the second copy is developed by a different team using a different

- [00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=442) by a different team using a different programming language and different algorithms.

- [00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=445) programming language and different algorithms. However, adding diversity and

- [00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=448) However, adding diversity and redundancy is complex, and this can

- [00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=451) redundancy is complex, and this can increase the risk. Of

- [00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=453) increase the risk. Of course, what are the different things that come with this?

- [00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=457) course, what are the different things that come with this? There are risks, and there may be dangers. Some

- [00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=461) There are risks, and there may be dangers. Some engineers advocate for simplicity and comprehensive

- [00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=463) engineers advocate for simplicity and comprehensive validation. Verification, or rather, validation, is

- [00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=465) validation. Verification, or rather, validation, is

- [00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=474) a more effective way to achieve software security. I need to do both. This means both

- [00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=476) need to do both. This means both redundancy, diversity, and

- [00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=479) redundancy, diversity, and verification. For Validation, diversity, redundancy,

- [00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=482) verification. For Validation, diversity, redundancy, and redundancy are examples of diversity and redundancy. For

- [00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=485) and redundancy are examples of diversity and redundancy. For example, in critical locations where it can be used,

- [00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=487) example, in critical locations where it can be used, for example, in e-commerce systems.

- [00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=489) for example, in e-commerce systems. This can also be used. The system must

- [00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=493) also be used. The system must be constantly online. Why? Because

- [00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=495) be constantly online. Why? Because if it's not online, it can have a significant economic cost.

- [00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=498) if it's not online, it can have a significant economic cost. Companies normally

- [00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=502) Companies normally maintain backup servers, and if a failure

- [00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=504) maintain backup servers, and if a failure occurs, they automatically

- [00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=506) occurs, they automatically switch to them. This also applies to hospital systems.

- [00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=509) switch to them. This also applies to hospital systems. Why? Because, for example,

- [00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=513) Why? Because, for example, during busy hours. If the hospital management

- [00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=515) during busy hours. If the hospital management system crashes, it needs to have a server

- [00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=518) system crashes, it needs to have a server

- [00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=521) to process patient transactions.

- [00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=527) Backups can be made immediately, and money can be collected periodically. However, this

- [00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=529) be collected periodically. However, this needs to be maintained instantly.

- [00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=532) needs to be maintained instantly. So, what needs to be a live server? It

- [00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=534) So, what needs to be a live server? It

- [00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=539) needs to be activated immediately. This is what redundancy diversity is. Different results can be applied using

- [00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=542) redundancy diversity is. Different results can be applied using different operating

- [00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=544) different operating systems, such as Windows and Linux, to provide some protection against external attacks.

- [00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=546) systems, such as Windows and Linux, to provide some protection against external attacks.

- [00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=550) This is for a different critical system.

- [00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=553) for a different critical system. For example, if you're using a system vulnerable to attack,

- [00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=557) For example, if you're using a system vulnerable to attack, you might have two servers.

- [00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=560) you might have two servers. But one is a different operating system.

- [00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=562) But one is a different operating system. So, it

- [00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=566) So, it

- [00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=571) would be more reasonable to use both redundancy and diversity simultaneously. Think about it this way.

- [00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=577) Think about it this way. Process

- [00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=579) Process activities like time variations and redundancy verification should be

- [00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=581) activities like time variations and redundancy verification should be tied to a single approach, such as testing to verify the system.

- [00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=583) tied to a single approach, such as testing to verify the system. Instead, multiple different

- [00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=586) Instead, multiple different process activities complement each other, and

- [00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=589) process activities complement each other, and I'll write about process errors that can lead to errors.

- [00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=591) I'll write about process errors that can lead to errors. To prevent cross-checking,

- [00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=593) To prevent cross-checking, tomorrow we also allow it here, for example, in

- [00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=597) tomorrow we also allow it here, for example, in Artificial Intelligence, we are changing it to Cross Validation.

- [00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=599) Artificial Intelligence, we are changing it to Cross Validation. What is it used for? It's

- [00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=601) What is it used for? It's not all just for Artificial Intelligence. This

- [00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=604) not all just for Artificial Intelligence. This song isn't essential for AI. If

- [00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=608) song isn't essential for AI. If there's no AI,

- [00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=610) there's no AI, what does it do in this method anyway? Friends, we develop an algorithm

- [00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=612) what does it do in this method anyway? Friends, we develop an algorithm on different data sets,

- [00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=615) on different data sets, and

- [00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=618) and this is averaged. In other words,

- [00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=621) this is averaged. In other words, a cross-validation is performed. In this way,

- [00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=626) a cross-validation is performed. In this way,

- [00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=638) you test whether the AI ​​you developed has memorized or whether you know what you can teach a general AI. The goal in Artificial Intelligence is to achieve generalized intelligence.

- [00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=641) goal in Artificial Intelligence is to achieve generalized intelligence.

- [00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=651) We can give a 100% accurate algorithm model on what is trained and on the training set, or rather, on what it is. But when it comes to

- [00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=653) on the training set, or rather, on what it is. But when it comes to data it hasn't seen before, it

- [00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=656) data it hasn't seen before, it

- [00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=662) will fail because it memorizes a pill. But if it had done general learning,

- [00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=663) But if it had done general learning, applying it would have a much higher probability.

- [00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=666) applying it would have a much higher probability. That's how

- [00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=670) That's how I allow software to ensure errors.

- [00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=673) I allow software to ensure errors.

- [00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=677) Why is it repeatable? And as long as the third is written,

- [00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=680) repeatable? And as long as the third is written, what is a living system that

- [00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=685) needs to constantly evolve and progress? Therefore, the process will

- [00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=687) Therefore, the process will need to be repeated. A well-defined,

- [00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=690) need to be repeated. A well-defined, repeatable process is

- [00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=692) repeatable process is a process that is not entirely dependent on individual skills.

- [00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=694) a process that is not entirely dependent on individual skills. Rather, it

- [00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=697) Rather, it can be animated by different people. Because a

- [00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=700) can be animated by different people. Because a person can have a well-defined, repeatable process. Regulators use information about the process to verify whether good

- [00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=713) Of course, the regulator won't be constantly monitoring it. What will they do?

- [00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=715) will they do? I'll look at the processes you go through. It's

- [00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=718) I'll look at the processes you go through. It's

- [00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=726) clear that significant effort must be dedicated to verification and validation of the process activities. So, don't give it away. Validation is the

- [00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=740) description. There must be a sampling. It can be documented. Why? Because the

- [00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=742) be documented. Why? Because the regulatory system will review the

- [00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=744) regulatory system will review the documentation.

- [00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=747) documentation. Therefore, the methods you follow must

- [00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=749) Therefore, the methods you follow must be documentable. The process must have a defined process model that outlines

- [00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=768) A comprehensive set of standards must be developed for standardized software production and documentation.

- [00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=795) Various auditable processes include redundancy and various verification and validation

- [00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=796) and various verification and validation activities. What does this

- [00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=800) activities. What does this increase? Is it a

- [00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=897) this, but there is only one shared database, so what happens if there is an error in the database?

- [00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=899) so what happens if there is an error in the database? Vestel needs to stay.

- [00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=942) It's necessary in places where there are high requirements or the costs of system failure are very high. Fault tolerance

- [00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=948) means that the system can continue to function despite software failure. So, how do you do this? If you

- [00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=953) have a Windows application and an error occurs, you

- [00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=957) can't catch it. If you haven't anticipated it before, your application might give an error and

- [00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=961) you haven't anticipated it before, your application might give an error and stop working.

- [00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=963) stop working.

- [00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=970) You've probably seen errors like "stop working." So, what can you do

- [00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=972) can you do to prevent this from stopping? For example, by adding a global error-

- [00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=975) to prevent this from stopping? For example, by adding a global error- catching method to the software,

- [00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=979) catching method to the software,

- [00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=985) you can increase the error-recovery function. In this case, you can ensure that the application

- [00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=989) continues to function in a different way.

- [00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=995) This is the mother of this. If you start the methods and functions in the programming language

- [00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=1004) as subtasks, since errors won't occur in the main task you're writing, the

- [00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=1006) errors won't occur in the main task you're writing, the errors in the subtasks

- [00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=1009) errors in the subtasks won't prevent the main software from running. You can

- [00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=1015) restart that subtask when an error occurs. This also

- [00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=1019) This also raises the bar. Even if the system is proven to comply with the specifications, it

- [00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=1023) raises the bar. Even if the system is proven to comply with the specifications, it

- [00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=1036) must be fault-tolerant, as specification errors may occur or validation may be incorrect. A

- [00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=1428) error will affect the manual channel. That is, both the hardware and the software must be written differently so that it

- [00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=1430) hardware and the software must be written differently so that it works. This way, both

- [00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=1435) works. This way, both software and hardware are

- [00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=1438) software and hardware are prevented from failing simultaneously with the same error. Because there

- [00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=1441) prevented from failing simultaneously with the same error. Because there is diversity, if high availability is

- [00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=1444) is diversity, if high availability is required, you can use a few

- [00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=1447) required, you can use a few self-monitoring systems in parallel.

- [00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=1449) self-monitoring systems in parallel. This is the approach used

- [00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=1453) This is the approach used for flight control systems in the Erva Hot family.

- [00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=1455) for flight control systems in the Erva Hot family. Because there is

- [00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=1459) Because there is both redundancy and diversity.

- [00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=1461) both redundancy and diversity. Look, we will see now. If the main flight

- [00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=1760) I have your program. It was designed and implemented by teams in the park for different system versions.

- [00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=1762) by teams in the park for different system versions. Look, there

- [00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=1764) Look, there 's an important nuance here. It's assumed that the

- [00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=1768) 's an important nuance here. It's assumed that the same errors are unlikely to occur by different teams.

- [00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=1771) same errors are unlikely to occur by different teams. Naturally, the

- [00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=1773) Naturally, the algorithms used should be different,

- [00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=1776) algorithms used should be different, but they might not be different. Here,

- [00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=1781) but they might not be different. Here, they also use different programming languages.

- [00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=1783) they also use different programming languages. This

- [00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=1786) This reduces the probability of algorithmic errors. There's some empirical evidence that teams often

- [00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=1790) reduces the probability of algorithmic errors. There's some empirical evidence that teams often misinterpret specifications in the same way

- [00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=1792) misinterpret specifications in the same way and choose the same algorithms in their systems.

- [00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=1794) and choose the same algorithms in their systems.

- [00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=1800) Yes, this can happen, but the

- [00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=1803) this can happen, but the probability is very low.

- [00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=1805) probability is very low. When this happens,

- [00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=1809) When this happens, there are various methods to reduce this. We

- [00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=1811) there are various methods to reduce this. We 'll explain them within the software types. We'll discuss

- [00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=1814) 'll explain them within the software types. We'll discuss approaches to software errors within the

- [00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=1817) approaches to software errors within the same software specification. So,

- [00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=1819) same software specification. So, you say, for example, when 05 pressure

- [00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=1823) you say, for example, when 05 pressure is measured, here's a head tree. So, I

- [00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=1831) is measured, here's a head tree. So, I 'm giving a random example here, or when

- [00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=1832) 'm giving a random example here, or when blood sugar is measured, there

- [00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=1835) blood sugar is measured, there 's this much dose. What is this? The software

- [00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=1839) 's this much dose. What is this? The software specification defines the task. But the algorithms and programming language that determine

- [00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=1842) specification defines the task. But the algorithms and programming language that determine how this task will be performed

- [00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=1843) how this task will be performed

- [00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=1852) depend entirely on the developer. This means that the program code can be written in many different ways,

- [00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=1855) can be written in many different ways,

- [00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=1861) depending on the hardware and programming language to be used. This specification here

- [00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=1866) will intentionally fail in different ways. It depends on the software types, it is independent of the applications, and

- [00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=1870) is independent of the applications, and

- [00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=1875) it is assumed that it does not contain common errors. Strategies for achieving diversity include different programming

- [00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=1877) Strategies for achieving diversity include different programming languages, different design methods and

- [00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=1879) languages, different design methods and tools, and clear specification of different algorithms.

- [00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=1882) tools, and clear specification of different algorithms.

- [00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=1888) After doing all of this, the difference is that different applications will make the same mistake,

- [00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=1891) applications will make the same mistake, and it will take very little time.

- [00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=1895) and it will take very little time. Problems related to design types are

- [00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=1898) Problems related to design types are not different in terms of team culture.

- [00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=1900) not different in terms of team culture. Therefore, what is the action of addressing problems in the same way?

- [00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=1902) Therefore, what is the action of addressing problems in the same way?

- [00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=1906) Yes, this also applies to how teams are selected when forming teams,

- [00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=1914) team members, and Bekir's subordinates will also make a significant difference. Everyone

- [00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=1916) subordinates will also make a significant difference. Everyone comes from the same or similar environments and

- [00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=1919) comes from the same or similar environments and makes the same mistake. What can we say?

- [00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=1924) makes the same mistake. What can we say? It can lead to a predisposition to characteristic errors.

- [00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=1927) It can lead to a predisposition to characteristic errors. Different teams make the same mistakes.

- [00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=1930) Different teams make the same mistakes. Some parts of an application make the same mistakes

- [00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=1932) Some parts of an application make the same mistakes later than others. Therefore, all

- [00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=1934) later than others. Therefore, all teams tend to make mistakes in the same place.

- [00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=1935) teams tend to make mistakes in the same place. What are characteristic attacks in terms of

- [00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=1937) What are characteristic attacks in terms of specification errors? If the

- [00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=1940) specification errors? If the specification is faulty, the

- [00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=1943) specification is faulty, the team will make mistakes. There's nothing I can do about it.

- [00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=1945) team will make mistakes. There's nothing I can do about it. If there's a mistake in the specification, it will

- [00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=1948) If there's a mistake in the specification, it will either heat up all applications. Because mold, even

- [00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=1952) either heat up all applications. Because mold, even if it's with different teams. They

- [00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=1955) if it's with different teams. They have to monitor and implement that specification. They

- [00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=1958) have to monitor and implement that specification. They have to develop it. This can also be done to

- [00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=1961) have to develop it. This can also be done to some extent using multiple features.

- [00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=1962) some extent using multiple features.

- [00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=1969) Yes, specification dependency

- [00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=1972) dependency

- [00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=1977) is open to specification errors with both approaches to software redundancy. If the specification is incorrect, the system can fail.

- [00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=1979) is incorrect, the system can fail. This is also a hardware-related

- [00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=1983) This is also a hardware-related issue. However, software features are

- [00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=1984) issue. However, software features are generally more complex than hardware features

- [00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=1986) generally more complex than hardware features and are more difficult to verify.

- [00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=1990) and are more difficult to verify. So, in hardware,

- [00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=1992) So, in hardware, errors can arise from specification dependency.

- [00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=1994) errors can arise from specification dependency. This has sometimes been addressed by developing

- [00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=1997) This has sometimes been addressed by developing separate software specifications for the same user specification. In

- [00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=1999) separate software specifications for the same user specification. In

- [00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=2004) some cases, they've even said, "Let's make the specification different, so

- [00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=2008) even said, "Let's make the specification different, so

- [00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=2015) let's try to eliminate the possibility of thinking about the same error." But of course, there's a very extreme case.

- [00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=2019) But of course, there's a very extreme case. So, how are practical and applied

- [00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=2020) So, how are practical and applied improvements made? If the principle

- [00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=2023) improvements made? If the principle is that interoperability and independence can be achieved,

- [00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=2026) and independence can be achieved, multi-version programming can lead to

- [00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=2029) multi-version programming can lead to significant improvements in reliability and usability. The

- [00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=2030) significant improvements in reliability and usability. The

- [00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=2036) improvements observed in practice are much less significant, and only the approach achieves a reliability improvement between 5 and 9 times.

- [00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=2039) significant, and only the approach achieves a reliability improvement between 5 and 9 times.

- [00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=2044) Looking at the observed improvements in practice, we can say that the observed improvements in practice are much less significant.

- [00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=2047) observed improvements in practice, we can say that the observed improvements in practice are much less significant. Because these errors

- [00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=2051) Because these errors don't happen all the time,

- [00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=2053) don't happen all the time, but when they do, they can lead to very Behçet results.

- [00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=2056) but when they do, they can lead to very Behçet results. So,

- [00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=2060) So, there's very little benefit in monitoring. We can observe what we've done,

- [00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=2061) there's very little benefit in monitoring. We can observe what we've done, but

- [00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=2065) but since the error is prevented from ever occurring, we can

- [00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=2067) since the error is prevented from ever occurring, we can actually observe how much has been gained.

- [00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=2069) actually observe how much has been gained. So, think about it this way. The

- [00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=2072) So, think about it this way. The key question is, we won't say that such improvements don't cost

- [00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=2076) key question is, we won't say that such improvements don't cost significant extra development for programming multiple versions. Of

- [00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=2078) significant extra development for programming multiple versions. Of

- [00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=2083) course, another question is that the difference and improvement

- [00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=2087) the difference and improvement will bring a very serious cost. So,

- [00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=2090) will bring a very serious cost. So, only if it's worth it and sustainable. You

- [00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=2093) only if it's worth it and sustainable. You

- [00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=2100) can make a sustainable Sancak in terms of cost and profit, otherwise we won't make that software at all. So, if the

- [00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=2102) we won't make that software at all. So, if the profit and loss ratio doesn't meet the cost,

- [00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=2107) profit and loss ratio doesn't meet the cost, reliable programming programs

- [00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=2110) reliable programming programs

- [00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=2113) help reduce the frequency of errors. These programming practices can

- [00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=2114) These programming practices can be identified. This program

- [00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=2117) be identified. This program supports the following: error

- [00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=2123) detection. We will do these. We've already seen these in a section.

- [00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=2135) Let's look at the recommendations for the most reliable program. Why are reliable programming

- [00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=2137) Why are reliable programming guidelines? Limit the visibility of information in a program,

- [00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=2140) guidelines? Limit the visibility of information in a program,

- [00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=2147) that is, unnecessary information should not be visible.

- [00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=2151) should not be visible. Check the validity of all inputs. This is always,

- [00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=2154) Check the validity of all inputs. This is always, always, what a software

- [00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=2157) always, what a software engineer should do. You

- [00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=2162) engineer should do. You should never trust any input. You should never trust the message.

- [00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=2164) should never trust any input. You should never trust the message. String in experience. You expect a fig. Are you

- [00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=2171) city to be as you expect?

- [00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=2180) Provide a handler for all exceptions. So, if it happens in Istanbul, that exception will be on its own. It shouldn't be left open,

- [00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=2183) exception will be on its own. It shouldn't be left open, and that exception should be managed in a way that

- [00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=2187) and that exception should be managed in a way that minimizes its use,

- [00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=2190) minimizes its use, making it error-prone. It provides restart capabilities.

- [00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=2192) making it error-prone. It provides restart capabilities. Restarting is

- [00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=2194) Restarting is crucial because its homework can cause errors, and the only

- [00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=2196) crucial because its homework can cause errors, and the only solution is restarting. And your

- [00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=2199) solution is restarting. And your software should be able to do this. Check the array boundaries. If

- [00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=2202) software should be able to do this. Check the array boundaries. If you're using an array, you

- [00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=2206) you're using an array, you

- [00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=2215) should be careful about the boundaries there. If you're manipulating elements in our indexes, you should be careful about the boundaries. When we're looking for external components, it should also be opened from time to time.

- [00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=2217) also be opened from time to time. Why? Because the external component

- [00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=2221) Why? Because the external component doesn't have control over its existence. Its response isn't in your hands. You'll

- [00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=2223) doesn't have control over its existence. Its response isn't in your hands. You'll

- [00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=2228) have to give it instructions, otherwise you might have to wait forever.

- [00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=2230) might have to wait forever.

- [00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=2237) Name all constants that represent real-world values. So, when you define a variable,

- [00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=2243) don't give it meaningless names like a, b, c, d, but what does it do? What does it do? It's

- [00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=2245) What does it do? It's something. My name is something. Then,

- [00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=2248) something. My name is something. Then,

- [00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=2254) variable naming is very important. It's very important to see information in a program.

- [00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=2256) see information in a program. Now, we

- [00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=2258) Now, we 'll explore these techniques more closely. Program

- [00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=2260) 'll explore these techniques more closely. Program components should only be allowed to

- [00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=2263) components should only be allowed to access the data they need for these applications.

- [00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=2265) access the data they need for these applications. This means that

- [00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=2268) This means that some parts of the program state shouldn't be

- [00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=2270) some parts of the program state shouldn't be accidentally corrupted by these components.

- [00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=2272) accidentally corrupted by these components. We can control the data

- [00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=2275) We can control the data presentation using abstract data

- [00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=2278) presentation using abstract data types where data is specific and visible

- [00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=2281) types where data is specific and visible only. We can control the data

- [00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=2285) only. We can control the data beforehand using predefined data types like get and put. Do

- [00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=2286) beforehand using predefined data types like get and put. Do you allow access with defined operations?

- [00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=2290) you allow access with defined operations? Of course, more advanced programming is needed.

- [00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=2293) Of course, more advanced programming is needed. How to do this

- [00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=2295) How to do this can vary depending on different programming languages. All

- [00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=2298) can vary depending on different programming languages. All

- [00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=2308) programs check all inputs for validity. This is a lot of people. All programs take input from their environment and make assumptions about these inputs.

- [00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=2311) and make assumptions about these inputs. However, program

- [00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=2315) However, program features are kept secret with these assumptions.

- [00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=2318) features are kept secret with these assumptions. Otherwise, they define what to do.

- [00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=2320) Otherwise, they define what to do. Consequently, many programs

- [00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=2324) Consequently, many programs

- [00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=2329) behave unpredictably when presented with external inputs, and sometimes these are threats to system security. For

- [00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=2331) these are threats to system security. For example,

- [00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=2334) example, you will investigate this. If

- [00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=2337) you will investigate this. If

- [00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=2342) you do not verify the inputs you receive from the user, they can easily add them to our database. Oh, they even

- [00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=2345) add them to our database. Oh, they even know you completely, you are always standing still.

- [00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=2348) know you completely, you are always standing still. Here is all the information about this minced meat has

- [00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=2350) Here is all the information about this minced meat has been stolen. These are generally caused by not checking the locations and ensuring

- [00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=2354) been stolen. These are generally caused by not checking the locations and ensuring adequate control.

- [00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=2356) adequate control. Wars. As a result,

- [00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=2360) Wars. As a result,

- [00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=2363) according to the assumptions made about these inputs, you should check this before processing the process. That is, you will not

- [00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=2370) say "Input is correct." You will always think that the user is a malicious hacker.

- [00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=2373) a malicious hacker. We will check the valid

- [00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=2377) We will check the valid checks, such as the interval checks.

- [00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=2380) checks, such as the interval checks. Check the 16 known inputs of your

- [00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=2383) Check the 16 known inputs of your mother. We said, for example, a water

- [00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=2387) mother. We said, for example, a water treatment system, a chemical, for example, that

- [00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=2391) treatment system, a chemical, for example, that allows our hand to be entered, which is

- [00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=2393) allows our hand to be entered, which is harmful to human health. So,

- [00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=2396) harmful to human health. So, whether it is quoted or not, but Check You will

- [00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=2398) whether it is quoted or not, but Check You will

- [00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=2405) check that the game controls do not open the maximum size and open the Love size. For example, if our database

- [00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=2409) our database supports a maximum of 40 characters for a horse, and you

- [00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=2410) supports a maximum of 40 characters for a horse, and you allow a character, this will cause a database error. If you allow a character, this will

- [00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=2412) allow a character, this will cause a database error. If you allow a character, this will

- [00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=2417) cause a failure of five. Nurse controls check that the initiative representation

- [00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=3033) This is another advantage. Of course, these times are not truly constant. So, you

- [00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=3037) Of course, these times are not truly constant. So, you only

- [00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=3039) only need to make the change in one place in your program. Because

- [00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=3043) need to make the change in one place in your program. Because you always called that name, you changed it, your charge

- [00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=3045) you always called that name, you changed it, your charge named, instead of that variable containing ms-100,

- [00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=3047) named, instead of that variable containing ms-100, you didn't write a hundred. Look at it as a number. The

- [00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=3053) key points for Hello are difficult to access software varieties. Because it's

- [00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=3055) difficult to access software varieties. Because it's

- [00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=3059) almost impossible to ensure that each version of the software is truly independent. For the reasons I've explained, it relies on the inclusion of

- [00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=3087) some programming structures and techniques like floating point, these simpoint numbers,

- [00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=3090) by nature, we made mistakes. In terms of the prayer back, whatever programming language

- [00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=3094) you use,

- [00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=3100) you should try to avoid these structures when developing security systems. Yes, friends, let's create a fesi

- [00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=3103) create a fesi and hopefully you're right.

- [00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tL0ylDPtgo&t=3113) and hopefully you're right. We'll see you in the last lesson. You'll learn 14. We've
