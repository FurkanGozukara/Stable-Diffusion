### Video Transcription


- [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=0) Greetings everyone. Welcome to the most beginner&nbsp; friendly guide for how to do training on Stable&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=6) Diffusion models by using Automatic1111 web UI.&nbsp; In this tutorial I will train portrait images of&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=12) my brother by using Low-Rank Adaptation, as&nbsp; known as LoRA training method on the Stable&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=18) Diffusion 2.1 768 pixels model. If you do not&nbsp; have prior knowledge, please watch these two&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=25) videos on our channel. On our channel, go to&nbsp; the playlist section and in here you see we&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=32) have Stable Diffusion DreamBooth playlist And in&nbsp; here first watch easiest way to install and run&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=41) Stable Diffusion web UI on PC. So this will teach&nbsp; you how to install web UI on PC and how to run it.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=50) And then watch how to use Stable Diffusion version&nbsp; 2.1 and different models in the web UI. This will&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=57) teach you how to download and install different&nbsp; models and use them with the web UI. After that,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=63) you are ready to watch this tutorial and&nbsp; follow me. To be able to train with LoRA,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=70) you need to go to the extensions tab&nbsp; here and install DreamBooth extension,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=74) check for updates. And if you don't know how to&nbsp; install from available, first go to available tab,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=82) load from and in here search DreamBooth. Since&nbsp; I am currently hiding extension with installed&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=90) it is not showing. But when I disable it, you&nbsp; see DreamBooth is already installed but it has&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=96) updates. So I am going to update it. OK, so&nbsp; for updating, we just click apply and restart&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=102) UI and it updates. Now, when we check for updates,&nbsp; you see we have the latest version. And, as I&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=108) said, for installation, go to available. And when&nbsp; I check this installed, it shows the DreamBooth is&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=114) here and click install. OK, that's all it. After&nbsp; that, and after you restart your application,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=120) you may need to do a full restart for DreamBooth&nbsp; tab to appear. You will get this tab. OK, and once&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=128) you are in here and from the models, you have the&nbsp; version 2.1. You are ready to follow me. You see,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=138) current Stable Diffusion checkpoint is 2.1.&nbsp; OK, first of all, before starting our training,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=144) we need to prepare our images. Since I am going&nbsp; to use 768 pixels version, I need to set my images&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=153) as 768 pixels. So my images are inside in this&nbsp; folder. I didn't still set their resolution. So&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=164) first I will show you how you can crop them with&nbsp; an open source, a free software: Paint .NET. Let&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=171) me show you Paint .NET. OK, this is the Paint&nbsp; .NET and you can download paint dot net from its&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=178) official website in here. It's an open source .NET&nbsp; based software. Alternatively, you can use this&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=184) website, which is free to resize and crop your&nbsp; images. But I prefer Paint .NET. I will show how&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=190) to crop one of the images. So I am going to drag&nbsp; and drop this image into here. Click open. And&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=196) in here you see there is rectangle select, and in&nbsp; here I click fixed ratio. I set it one hundred and&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=203) one hundred, like this. Then I am selecting the&nbsp; image like this as I want. I click ctrl-C to copy,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=210) I click ctrl-R for resize. I am typing something&nbsp; smaller and clicking enter. Then I am clicking&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=218) ctrl-V expanding. Then I am clicking ctrl-R&nbsp; again to resize. And I am exactly resizing as 768&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=228) pixels. Then I save it with one hundred percent&nbsp; quality. You can also use PNG or JPG images.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=238) Alternatively, you can use Birme dot net as well.&nbsp; However, you may not trust this website. It is up&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=246) to you. So I will select two images from here,&nbsp; upload them. And in here I am going to select&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=252) 768 pixels like this: 768 pixels. OK, and you can&nbsp; just set where you want cut to be like this. Then&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=263) you need to click save as zip. It will download a&nbsp; zip like this. You can click it and you can then&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=271) extract them into your folder and overwrite&nbsp; existing files And they will be exactly as. Let me&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=279) show you 768 pixels. I will open with paint, not&nbsp; net, And you see they are 768 pixels. So this is&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=288) the way you need to prepare your images. OK, all&nbsp; images are cropped by 768 pixels and 768 pixels.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=296) Now we are ready to do training. So go to our&nbsp; Stable Diffusion web UI. So you may wonder what&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=305) is LoRA? LoRA is a low-rank adaptation for faster&nbsp; text to image diffusion fine tuning. It uses both&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=312) UNET and CLIP. It is faster than DreamBooth. Also,&nbsp; its checkpoints are much smaller than the full&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=318) checkpoint of DreamBooth. When you do a checkpoint&nbsp; with DreamBooth, it generates full .ckpt file.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=327) However, LoRA generates much smaller&nbsp; files. And when you are done,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=332) you can generate the full checkpoint file. To&nbsp; do training we go to the DreamBooth tab here&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=338) and we first need to generate our model. I am&nbsp; going to use my brother. I need to select the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=345) source checkpoint. I have selected version&nbsp; 2.1 like this: I am using the EMA version&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=351) and I am not going to click this. This is not&nbsp; necessary. OK, and just click Create button.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=361) After you click Create button, you see it is&nbsp; downloading the necessary files from the internet&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=368) like this. So you need to wait this download.&nbsp; If you are not seeing anything on the web UI,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=374) always check the running command line&nbsp; window to see what is happening like this:&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=382) OK, the model has been generated. You see&nbsp; checkpoint successfully extracted to Models&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=387) DreamBooth my brother working. We can also check&nbsp; it from our installed folder. Let's go to C drive&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=393) and I have installed in StableDiffusion web UI,&nbsp; in Models and in here in StableDiffusion. And now&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=402) no, not in StableDiffusion in DreamBooth folder,&nbsp; and in here you see there is working directory and&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=407) there is my brother directory, as you can see.&nbsp; OK, let's return back to our interface. In here&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=414) you see there is LoRA Weight. So this defines what&nbsp; percentage of LoRA Weight should be applied to the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=421) UNET when training or creating a checkpoint, and&nbsp; it is same for Text Weight. Setting this as 1 may&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=429) cause overtraining, over tuning. However, since&nbsp; we are going to do generate our portrait images,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=439) our own portrait images, and we are just teaching&nbsp; one face, this is fine for now. You can pick this&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=446) half model. It will enable FP16 Precision, which&nbsp; results in a smaller checkpoint with minimal loss&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=453) in quality. But we don't need this for LoRA,&nbsp; since the checkpoints are already low size.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=459) And when you click this, checkpoints will be saved&nbsp; to a subdirectory in the selected checkpoints&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=464) folder. So I am going to click training wizard&nbsp; person. OK, and let's set up our parameters.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=472) This is really important. So how many training&nbsp; steps we want to do for each image? How many&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=479) images do I have? I have images. Let me show once&nbsp; again: total: 16. OK, since I am going to compare&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=488) checkpoints quality, I am going to set this very&nbsp; high because I will early terminate the training&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=496) or I will decide whether I have trained enough or&nbsp; not. OK, I am setting max training steps as zero,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=503) pause after an epochs zero, amount of time passed&nbsp; between epochs. By the way, one epoch equal to 16&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=511) steps because I have 16 images. OK, and I am not&nbsp; going to set any with pause between epochs. So&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=520) use lifetime steps, epochs when saving. Let's&nbsp; say you have stopped or paused your training&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=527) and then later at a time you continue it. So use&nbsp; lifetime means that it will consider your previous&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=535) training epochs steps as well. However, if you&nbsp; unclick this, it will use only this session of&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=542) training steps and epochs when saving. So I am&nbsp; just unclicking it. This is really important.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=550) The save checkpoint frequency by n steps. OK,&nbsp; since I didn't click this, it will check by n&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=558) steps. Since I have 16 images. If I set this 16,&nbsp; it will save checkpoint after each epoch. OK,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=570) if it is confusing for you, you can just click&nbsp; this and you can set this 10. So it will save&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=575) checkpoints every 10 epochs. In this case, since&nbsp; I have 16 images, it will be after 160 training&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=587) steps. OK, this is fine. I will also save a&nbsp; preview of the image after each checkpoint&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=593) so that I can decide whether that checkpoint is&nbsp; good or not. I will explain this in the video,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=601) so don't worry about that, You will understand&nbsp; it. Batch size: OK, how many images to process&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=607) process at once per training step? We are going&nbsp; to process one image per training step and we will&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=616) do same for classifier regularization images to&nbsp; generate at once. If you have more than one GPU,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=624) you can increase batch size to process them&nbsp; in parallel I suppose. Learning rate and&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=631) other rates. I am not going to touch them, but&nbsp; you can try to obtain better learning rates or&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=638) encoder rates. You can also scale the learning&nbsp; rate, but I am just leaving them as default. OK,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=647) image processing: This is important. Since I&nbsp; am using 768 pixel version, I am setting it&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=655) as 768. However, if you use another version,&nbsp; like version 1.5, in that case you need to&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=664) use 512 pixels. So this resolution depends on&nbsp; your Stable Diffusion model, version and type.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=673) I am not going to do any cropping since I have&nbsp; cropped. Apply horizontal flip. It means that&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=681) the images will be flipped as well, so it will&nbsp; add more variation to your images. You can set&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=688) this. Do we have pretrained VAE Name or Path? No,&nbsp; we don't have. We will use the base model vae.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=695) When you watch my previous videos, you will learn&nbsp; what is vae and how to set them. OK, concept list:&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=702) I am not going to use any concept list as well,&nbsp; since I am just going to train for teaching one&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=710) portrait image. And advanced tab: OK,&nbsp; this is important. This is where we set&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=715) our training methodology. We are going to use&nbsp; LoRA methodology. So use 8bit Adam. This is,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=723) enable this to save VRAM. If your graphic&nbsp; card VRAM is not much or let's say you&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=730) have encountered not enough VRAM problem while&nbsp; training, you can set this. I am going to set&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=736) this for now because I'm not sure how much VRAM&nbsp; it is going to take. And you can also set FP 16.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=744) So, mixed precision. You probably want this to be&nbsp; FP16. If using Xformers. You definitely want this&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=752) to be FP 16. And if you have watched my previous&nbsp; videos, you know that we are already using&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=758) Xformers to speed up our inference and training.&nbsp; So I am going to set this. Memory Attention:&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=765) I am going to set this Xformers. My graphic card&nbsp; is RTX 3060 and it supports that. OK, Don't Cache&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=775) Latents: When I hover my mouse over that, you&nbsp; see, there appears a tooltip and explains to me&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=783) what does that checkbox is doing. When this box is&nbsp; checked, latents will not be cached. When latents&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=790) are not caged, you will save a bit of VRAM but&nbsp; train slightly slower. So for a lower VRAM usage,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=797) I am checking this. Train Text Encode. Enabling&nbsp; this will provide better results and editability&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=804) but cost more VRAM. Yes, we are setting this.&nbsp; I am not changing any of default parameters&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=813) And I am not changing these parameters as well.&nbsp; So we are done with parameters tab. By the way,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=821) I will make this arbitrarily high number because&nbsp; I will stop it myself. The training myself.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=827) OK, concepts. This is really important. This is&nbsp; the part where we are setting what to teach. OK,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=836) maximum training steps is minus one. It will&nbsp; never end. OK, data set directory. Path to&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=844) the directory with input images. So to get the&nbsp; director of my input images. I am right clicking&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=851) one of the image, right clicking properties, left&nbsp; clicking. And in here you see it shows location.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=856) I am copying this like this. Alternatively,&nbsp; you can also click the search bar here and&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=864) select entire path and copy. And I am pasting&nbsp; it here. Classification data set directory. OK,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=872) this is a path to directly with classification&nbsp; regularization images. So let's also set a path&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=879) for this to understand what is it. So, however,&nbsp; you shouldn't set them inside here because in that&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=887) case it is using, I think, all of the images&nbsp; in all of the folders. So let's say, brother&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=897) classification folder. OK, let's enter here.&nbsp; Copy the path like this. File words: OK,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=908) we are not going to use any file words in this&nbsp; training because we are not training hypernet, or&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=916) let me show you what was it. It is embedding.&nbsp; Therefore, you can just leave this empty. But&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=924) prompts: this is where we need to enter a unique&nbsp; prompt to teach the face of or the other thing&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=933) that we want to teach to the model. So I will give&nbsp; it a unique name as my brother. OK, like this,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=943) you can give any unique name. It should be unique&nbsp; enough that it won't be in the original training&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=951) data set. So to be sure, you can just also expand&nbsp; it like this. Class Prompt. Now this is important.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=957) What am I teaching to the model? I am teaching&nbsp; face of a man. So I will say face of a man.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=966) OK, like this. Classification image, negative&nbsp; prompt. OK, you may give a negative prompt to&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=976) generate better quality classification images.&nbsp; These images will be generated to improve your&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=983) training success. They will be automatically&nbsp; generated. So let's enter a good negative&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=988) prompt here. OK, I have a decent negative prompt I&nbsp; have prepared previously. I have used a chatGPT to&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=996) expand some of the famous negative prompts. I will&nbsp; put this into the comment section of the video.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=1004) So, don't worry, you will be able to copy and&nbsp; paste it. So I'm copying and pasted in here. So&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=1011) I will explain to you what is this as well. So&nbsp; this class prompt and classification images what&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=1018) are they? Sample Image Prompt. This is important&nbsp; Why? Because during the training we want to see&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=1025) how the training is going on. And for that we&nbsp; will generate sample images. So the sample images&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=1032) will be like this: First we will give the instance&nbsp; prompt so that we will be able to see the face of&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=1042) the person we are teaching. Then you can append&nbsp; here some of the good keywords to obtain better&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=1050) results. But if you just want to see how much&nbsp; the model has learned, you can leave this only&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=1057) with the instance prompt. So you will get a better&nbsp; idea of how much the face has been learned by the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=1067) model. Sample prompt template. We don't need&nbsp; a prompt template right now. Sample image:&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=1073) negative prompt. You can just copy and paste&nbsp; it in here as well. Okay, Image Generation. So&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=1080) when doing training we will generate, let's&nbsp; say, generic images, generic face of a man,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=1088) images to make our training more generalized.&nbsp; Okay, to improve its success rate. So I will&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=1100) generate 10 times of the my input like this. And&nbsp; these are for the other things that you need to&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=1110) set for generating template images, we may say,&nbsp; or generic images, we may say. Number of samples&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=1116) to generate one. Okay, it looks good. Okay, you&nbsp; can just enter 10 times of it. It's up to you.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=1123) And we are ready to do training. But I will also&nbsp; show you one other thing in settings. In settings&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=1133) when you go to training section here, you can&nbsp; reduce VRAM usage by clicking this checkbox. Okay,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=1143) I think it will probably reduce your training&nbsp; speed. And you can also turn on pin memory for&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=1150) data loader. Make training slightly faster but&nbsp; increase memory usage. So you may play with these&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=1155) settings to obtain the best possible training&nbsp; speed. I have 12 GB VRAM. So I may open this,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=1168) but I won't open that. Also. Yeah, the others are&nbsp; just fine. Okay, and let's click training button,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=1179) since we are ready. Okay, when we click training&nbsp; button, first it will generate the generic&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=1189) face of a man images. Why face of&nbsp; a man? Because we have entered our&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=1198) class prompt as face of a man and where&nbsp; they will be saved. I think they will&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=1202) save it in here brother classification. So it is&nbsp; starting to generate our generic face images to&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=1213) add more variety to our data set. So you see,&nbsp; it is generating face of a man with the given&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=1220) prompt I have. You can also improve this prompt&nbsp; with adding other, let's say, styling prompts,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=1229) more quality prompts, anything you want. If&nbsp; you watch my previous videos on the channel,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=1237) on the playlist, you will understand what I&nbsp; mean. This is actually same as doing inference&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=1243) text2img from here to generate images. It is&nbsp; exactly doing that to improve variety of our&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=1257) classification training. You see they&nbsp; are really bad quality right now,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=1264) So maybe we should tune our class prompt.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=1272) To do that I will just cancel the training&nbsp; with clicking cancel button. You see training&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=1280) cancelled. And you see that these are&nbsp; the images it has generated. I will&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=1287) modify. I have deleted all of them. I will modify&nbsp; the class prompt by adding some keywords. Okay, to&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=1299) decide what to enter, I have moved to text2image&nbsp; tab and I have typed: portrait photo of a man,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=1306) HDR, 8K and sharp. The keywords that you will find&nbsp; from real photos of people. And I have entered my&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=1316) negative prompt as well and this is the image that&nbsp; has been generated. It is pretty good. So I am&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=1322) returning back to my DreamBooth tab and in here&nbsp; I am changing to my the class prompt like this&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=1330) and now I am clicking train again. Now it will&nbsp; generate 160 class images for training. Basically&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=1343) the generic images to improve my training quality.&nbsp; Let's see what kind of results we are going to&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=1350) get. We should get results same as we got in&nbsp; text2image tab actually. Yeah, it's a decent&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=1357) face photo of a male. Why we are doing this? As&nbsp; I said, to increase the variance variation. When&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=1371) you have different styles, different variations of&nbsp; photos. It will prevent over training and it will&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=1381) force model to learn face of the person that you&nbsp; want to teach. OK, so you see, now we are getting&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=1389) really decent quality face images of male persons&nbsp; and it will help our model to learn better.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=1401) OK, meanwhile, the training is going on. I&nbsp; mean, the image generation is going on. Let's&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=1408) quickly recap. First, we generated our model with&nbsp; a unique name like this, and we have selected the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=1415) source checkpoint. You can source checkpoint any&nbsp; model on the Internet that you want to teach. OK,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=1422) it will work. Exactly same as version 2.1.&nbsp; The only thing that may differ if your model&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=1431) is based on stable diffusion 1.5 or 1.4, they&nbsp; use 512 pixel size images. Therefore, the only&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=1442) thing that you need to change is the image&nbsp; size, which is where was it? Let me show you.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=1454) Here image processing resolution. So, if you use&nbsp; a checkpoint model based on 1.5, 1.4 or 512 pixel&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=1464) based 2.x version, then you need to change this to&nbsp; 512 pixel. But if you are using 2.1 version based&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=1475) model which has native 768 pixel resolution,&nbsp; then you need to change that. Other than that,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=1486) we are going to parameters: training steps per&nbsp; image. I have set this very big number because&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=1491) I will stop the training myself at a certain&nbsp; point. I will show you when I will stop it and&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=1498) how I will decide to stop training, And this is&nbsp; important. I will save and generate images every&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=1507) 10 epoch. Every 10 epoch means that one epoch&nbsp; will happen when it process all of the images&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=1514) in my training folder. I have 16 images in my&nbsp; training folder, which is here. It will also put,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=1523) I think, flipped images there, so it will be 32&nbsp; images. We will see that when training starts,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=1529) currently still generating the generic images that&nbsp; I have requested, like this. OK, so I will be able&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=1539) to decide whether model has learned enough so that&nbsp; I can stop and start using the model or not. OK,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=1548) so these save previews and save checkpoints is&nbsp; really important to see the progress of training.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=1556) The batch size is, I think, related to how many&nbsp; GPUs you have, or if you have a very strong GPU&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=1564) that can process in parallel two images at the&nbsp; same time. If it has enough VRAM memory, you can&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=1572) also increase this. But if your graphic card can&nbsp; only process one image at a time, then you should&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=1579) leave both of these as one. I didn't change any&nbsp; of the learning rates or other things. I did leave&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=1588) them default. I have also applied horizontal flip&nbsp; randomly. Decide to flip images horizontally so&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=1596) that it will add more variation to the learning&nbsp; data set. I don't have any VAE or concept list.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=1606) I am using LoRA because with this way it will use&nbsp; lesser VRAM than DreamBooth. And the save files&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=1617) will be 1000 times lesser than the DreamBooth,&nbsp; because DreamBooth generates full size model&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=1624) files for checkpoints. However, this will generate&nbsp; minimal files. Then from those files, after we&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=1632) are satisfied with the training process, we will&nbsp; generate full model. I am using 8bit Adam to save&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=1640) VRAM. I am using mixed precision memory attention&nbsp; and I didn't change any other parameters. And in&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=1647) the concepts I did set my data set directory and&nbsp; the classification data set directory. I have&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=1653) already shown you them. We are not using any file&nbsp; words because we are not doing a general concept&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=1660) training. It is not the context of this video.&nbsp; I may make another video to train hypernet or&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=1670) textual embeddings. The instance prompt. This is&nbsp; really important because this keyword is being&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=1680) taught to our model. So when I do inference&nbsp; with the new model, the tuned model, it will&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=1689) know that this keyword is the face of my brother&nbsp; pictures. Therefore, this is really important.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=1698) This is the generic class prompt. I already&nbsp; have explained that. And these are the arbitrary&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=1706) numbers. Actually, this is the arbitrary number&nbsp; I have entered. I didn't change the other things.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=1713) These are only affecting the images generated&nbsp; in here. None other than that. So this part is&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=1723) only important for these images. So it will&nbsp; generate 160 images in this folder. You see,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=1730) it is also generating same named text files and&nbsp; it is saving the description of the input. You&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=1740) could also modify these descriptions, but&nbsp; I think it is not very important for LoRA&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=1744) training. It is important for hypernetwork and&nbsp; especially for text embeddings. Now I will pause&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=1752) video until the image generation has been done&nbsp; and the training has started. OK, meanwhile,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=1759) the class image generation: So far, we are almost&nbsp; at 50 percent. It says there is still 20 minutes&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=1767) remaining. Approximately. It is using 95 percent&nbsp; of my GPU. It is using almost 9 gigabytes of my&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=1777) GPU and it is using about 20 percent of CPU. So&nbsp; these are the values that it is using for just&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=1785) class image generation. And let's see how much&nbsp; it will use for training. And the class image&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=1793) generation speed is 14.58 seconds / IT. OK, the&nbsp; training process has started. After generating all&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=1804) of the images. Let me show you them. Once you have&nbsp; generated these generic images, you don't have to&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=1811) generate them once again. You can stop and restart&nbsp; training and use these base generic images.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=1819) However, an error occurred. So my web interface&nbsp; is not getting updated anymore, unfortunately.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=1829) But the training is going on, as you&nbsp; can see. Currently it is two iterations,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=1834) actually two seconds per iteration as a&nbsp; speed. It has done 145 iterations so far.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=1847) And let's see how much VRAM. Oh, you see,&nbsp; my entire VRAM is almost full. It says&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=1856) that there is allocated and reserved, but I am&nbsp; seeing the full VRAM usage in my graphic card.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=1864) And after 10 epochs we are supposed to get our&nbsp; first training output to see. OK, it says that&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=1875) you see, LoRA weights successfully saved to C&nbsp; Stable Diffusion web UI, which is my folder.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=1880) Inside models LoRA. So let's go there and check it&nbsp; out. In Stable Diffusion web UI in models in LoRA.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=1893) OK, so you see, this is the checkpoint file it&nbsp; has generated and it is only three megabytes. So&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=1900) I can generate checkpoint file for even every&nbsp; epoch. However, if we were using DreamBooth&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=1908) instead of the LoRA, this would be minimal, like&nbsp; 5 gigabytes or 6 gigabytes or 4 gigabytes based on&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=1916) the model that you are using as the first initial&nbsp; checkpoint. So for version 2.1, it would be equal&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=1927) to minimum five gigabytes because the base model&nbsp; is five gigabytes. If we were using DreamBooth&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=1933) instead of LoRA, our every checkpoint would&nbsp; be five gigabytes. But now we are only getting&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=1940) three megabytes checkpoint. It is even smaller&nbsp; than 1/1000. OK, so we should also got the first&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=1954) image output of our training. So where it is&nbsp; saved, If you are wondering, I think inside&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=1962) DreamBooth, in my brother's in here samples.&nbsp; Yes, So this is the first sample image it has&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=1970) generated after ten epochs. In this folder, as&nbsp; the time passes we are going to see images that&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=1979) will be similar to my brother's sample images.&nbsp; Let me show you our training data set images.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=1989) Let me show you once again. So once we get images&nbsp; as close as possible to our training data set,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=1997) then we will, we will, we will generate a&nbsp; checkpoint model file, full model file, from that&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=2007) file. Which file from the file?&nbsp; Let me open once again the C folder&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=2017) to explain better. In here in models in&nbsp; LoRA. So once we got a good image we are&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=2026) going to you see the file name is 160. We are&nbsp; going to get the same file in here and we will&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=2034) generate a full model checkpoint from that and&nbsp; then we will be able to generate the images of&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=2041) the person we train it for. OK, so now I will&nbsp; pause video until we got some good results.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=2050) Oh, by the way, it seems like. Yes, yes, the&nbsp; process has stopped. So therefore I have to&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=2057) continue. Probably an error has occurred. Yeah,&nbsp; an error occurred. So what we need to do is:&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=2066) OK, let me show you to continue from there.&nbsp; So I am refreshing the web interface. This&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=2074) error may occur time to time And in here I go&nbsp; back to the DreamBooth. And in here you see,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=2081) let's refresh. We have my brother as LoRA&nbsp; model. And OK, so let's click load params and&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=2093) see if it will load. I hope it loads. OK, it says&nbsp; loading. I maybe need to restart the application.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=2104) Yeah, probably I need to restart the application.&nbsp; You see, when you play with the web UI while&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=2110) training, these kind of errors may occur.&nbsp; So I will now restart the application. OK,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=2116) after I close the command line, you see connection&nbsp; error occurred. So let's go back to our stable&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=2124) diffusion web UI. Click web UI webui-user.bat.&nbsp; OK, I have restarted the web UI. Now refresh&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=2133) and go to the DreamBooth and pick the LoRA model.&nbsp; And let's click load params. Please specify model&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=2141) to load. So you see, my brother model is now here.&nbsp; After restart, and after I click load params,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=2149) load loaded config and I click train, it should&nbsp; continue from where it is left. OK, you see,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=2157) it is getting. Concept requires 160 images.&nbsp; It has loaded the same images, so it is not&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=2163) regenerating the classification images, It is&nbsp; loading the weights where it is left, I think.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=2172) So the number of examples: 16. Number of batches&nbsp; per epoch: 16.. Correct. Number of epochs: one&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=2179) million. As we have set, the total optimization&nbsp; step is 16 million. OK, everything looks correct.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=2188) And, yes, it is now continuing where it is&nbsp; left. This is great. So if an error occurs,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=2197) this is how you are going to continue your&nbsp; training. So you can further optimize your&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=2204) model from any checkpoint. And in&nbsp; here, if you see, let me zoom in.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=2210) You see, OK, I did zoom too much. Training step&nbsp; is 23. This is the current session. And, you see,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=2219) this is the lifetime session. So this is different&nbsp; that you are setting in here. Use lifetime steps,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=2226) epochs when saving. We didn't check that. So&nbsp; we are only taking into account the current&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=2233) session steps for saving and previewing the&nbsp; checkpoints. But this is the lifetime. OK,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=2240) now I will pause the video again. OK, so you see,&nbsp; after the second save and now it continue to do&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=2248) training. So sometimes errors may happen, even&nbsp; though they shouldn't. So if an error happens,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=2256) just restart application, just as I have shown,&nbsp; and continue to training. So the samples are&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=2264) getting produced. I hope it doesn't take too much&nbsp; time to teach my brother face into the model.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=2275) OK, it has been only 30 epochs so&nbsp; far and we already got somewhat&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=2282) similar picture in the third one. You see,&nbsp; this is the thirty epoch after 480 steps&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=2289) in total. And this is my brother. You see,&nbsp; there is a similarity, as you can see. OK,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=2298) I have noticed another mistake. You see the&nbsp; command line interface is displaying the LoRA&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=2305) weights has been saved to my brother, underline&nbsp; 160 dot PT. However, it is correctly saving in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=2313) folder. So this printed message is incorrect,&nbsp; but the same with file names are correct,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=2320) as you can see. So this is the thirty epoch has&nbsp; been done actually for. Actually for the epochs,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=2327) Yes, since we have 16 images, when you divide&nbsp; this 16, it is 40 epochs. And these are the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=2334) so far generated images. You see it starts to&nbsp; resemble more and more as the training continue.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=2340) OK, it has been over 1423 steps so far. So the&nbsp; training step speed is, for 1.60 seconds for per&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=2354) iteration. So far it is going on. We are getting&nbsp; closer to our target image, as you can see here.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=2364) OK, It has been over 5600 steps so&nbsp; far, which makes 350 epochs. And for&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=2377) this tutorial I am now going to cancel the&nbsp; training and I will generate a checkpoint&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=2385) based on the best that comes to me as best&nbsp; epoch number, which is sample 2400. You can&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=2397) continue to do training until you are satisfied&nbsp; with the results. But these results are just&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=2403) a preview of what it has learned. With a good&nbsp; prompt you can obtain much better photos. And&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=2411) also it also depends on your data set quality. If&nbsp; you prepare better images than in this example,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=2418) you can still obtain better results. I think&nbsp; this is a decent one. And let's generate our&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=2426) model checkpoint. So how we are going to&nbsp; generate our model checkpoint to use later.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=2432) You see there is a LoRA model and now we are&nbsp; going to generate checkpoint from our 2400.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=2442) I am entering the model name here&nbsp; that I want to give. Let's say, my&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=2448) brother test one, and I am clicking generate ckpt&nbsp; file. OK, it is generating. You can see that it is&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=2458) loading LoRA from the selected checkpoint from&nbsp; here and applying weight. As you can see here:&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=2467) LoRA weight: What percentage of LoRA weight&nbsp; should be applied to the UNET when training&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=2472) or creating checkpoint. Applying the text&nbsp; weight as well. And then it is saving. However,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=2479) the saved file name is not correct. You see, it&nbsp; has appended the latest training number, However&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=2488) it has loaded 2400. So I think there is a simple&nbsp; mistake in the web UI. So where it is saved,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=2499) It is saved inside Stable Diffusion installation&nbsp; folder, then models, then Stable Diffusion&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=2506) folder. OK, I am going to rename this&nbsp; into the name that I want. Let's say LoRA.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=2514) And you see it also has YAML file and it has&nbsp; to be the same name. OK, I did rename with F2.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=2522) OK, now I can do text2img and generate new images&nbsp; based on our training. How we are going to do&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=2530) that: First click refresh here and then my new&nbsp; model has appeared here. It is now loading. You&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=2539) can see the loading from this command window here:&nbsp; Loading config and loading other parameters. OK,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=2547) the model has been loaded. Now what is the&nbsp; prompt that we are going to do? The prompt&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=2555) we are going to do is the prompt we have given in&nbsp; here, which is my brother face. OK, this is our&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=2562) unique keyword. And then we will append the other&nbsp; keywords that we want. Even though our model has&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=2571) learned the face very good As soon as we add new&nbsp; keywords to improve and obtain different styles of&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=2581) the learned face, it totally produces different&nbsp; images. Unfortunately, no matter how many times&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=2589) I have tried, my all attempts have failed. It&nbsp; always produces different faces, not the face&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=2597) it has learned. If I only give my prompt instance,&nbsp; yes, it produces the face of my brother. But then&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=2606) what is the purpose of training? Because I am&nbsp; not able to modify it. Change the style, produce&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=2613) different styles. Therefore, now I will do another&nbsp; training with SD version 1.5. And let's see the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=2621) difference between SD version 2.1 and 1.5 when&nbsp; we are doing face training. Since SD version 1.5&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=2631) requires 512 pixel resolution, I am recutting the&nbsp; images, as you can see. I am cropping them again&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=2643) And I have removed some of the very old images.&nbsp; Actually, I only removed two of them. Okay,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=2650) it is like this that I am setting up the&nbsp; images for SD version 1.5 training. Okay, yes,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=2661) like this. Save as zip and open the downloaded&nbsp; file and extract them into the folder.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=2673) Okay, here, like this, I will overwrite and&nbsp; the training set is now ready. Okay, for 1.5,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=2680) I am first changing model into 1.5. Then I&nbsp; am going to the reboot. And in here we are&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=2689) going to generate a new model. Let's say,&nbsp; okay, brother, SD 15, like this. And the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=2698) source checkpoint will be 1.5 because we are&nbsp; starting a new model. Let's generate the model&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=2706) like this: Okay, it is preparing&nbsp; the model file for training.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=2712) Actually, everything is same. Then I am&nbsp; clicking training wizard person. It will&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=2717) set the parameters. Oh, I think I click&nbsp; it. Yeah, I didn't wait process to finish.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=2726) Okay, now I will set again. Okay, now it is set&nbsp; and the model is also set. All right, you see,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=2733) the model has arrived here for training. Okay, I&nbsp; am just doing the same things. By the way, we now&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=2741) need to recompose new class images for improving&nbsp; the test accuracy. Also, this apply: horizontal&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=2753) flip means that on the runtime it will sometimes&nbsp; provide the horizontally flipped images in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=2761) training. Okay, it won't generate new images on&nbsp; the folder, It will do that on the runtime. Okay,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=2769) I am selecting LoRA. I am using 8bit adam&nbsp; with FP16, xFormers. Don't Cache Latents.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=2785) Okay, I am not changing other things&nbsp; because it is already learning good,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=2789) but we weren't able to generate&nbsp; good images. I think it was due to&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=2794) version, SD version 2.1. Okay, the path for our&nbsp; VAE here. And classification. We now need to make&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=2808) new classification, so I will just make another&nbsp; folder too. Okay, like this: Let's enter here.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=2818) All right, we are leaving this empty because we&nbsp; are only teaching one phase. I will give the same&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=2825) name as the model name to instance prompt. Now&nbsp; class prompt. This is important to decide class&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=2834) prompt. Now I will do a few tests here. Okay,&nbsp; with a simple prompt, such as face photo of a man:&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=2841) 8K HDR, smooth, sharp focus and cinematography,&nbsp; we got decent faces. So this will be our class&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=2852) prompt. Okay, let's go back to our DreamBooth&nbsp; training, and the class prompt will be like this:&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=2859) Classification image, negative prompt. So let's&nbsp; also copy and paste it. By the way, don't worry,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=2865) I will provide these as comments. Okay, so the&nbsp; sample image prompt will be same as before. Okay,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=2875) and should I provide negative image prompt&nbsp; for sample? Yes, let's also provide it. Okay,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=2883) how many we want? This time? We have how&nbsp; many images in the folder? Let's check it out&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=2892) Once again. Okay, we have 14, so I will&nbsp; generate just 140. Okay, I'm not touching&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=2903) this. Parameters are set. Everything looking&nbsp; good. Okay, let's start another training.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=2915) So you see, since we don't have any concept images&nbsp; now, it is going to generate first our class&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=2923) images, as before. But this time we are using&nbsp; 512 pixel resolution. This is really important&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=2930) because our base model is now version 1.5 and&nbsp; it is using 512 pixel as native resolution.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=2940) Generating class images are now much faster, you&nbsp; see, because it is now lower size in dimension.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=2952) Okay so, the classification training set has been&nbsp; completed and now the training has started and so&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=2960) far we are at the 50 training step. You see, it is&nbsp; much faster now than before because we are simply&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=2969) working with 0.44, which means 44% of image size&nbsp; than before. Because before we were working on&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=2981) 768 pixels. Now we are working with 512 pixels.&nbsp; Therefore, it is more than two times faster.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=2990) New model training checkpoints are&nbsp; also getting saved under the models&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=2997) LoRA folder. As you can see here&nbsp; with the name that I have given.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=3001) Also, the new folder under DreamBooth has been&nbsp; generated for the new training in here, brother&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=3009) SD15. And in here we can see the samples it is&nbsp; generating: so far, nothing resembling at all.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=3017) Okay so the training has been completed. I let&nbsp; it run during the night while I was sleeping, so&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=3023) generated so many checkpoints. And now I am going&nbsp; to use this particular checkpoint to generate our&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=3031) .ckpt file from here. As usual, as previously&nbsp; same. I have selected the model entered,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=3041) selected the checkpoint, given a name, and&nbsp; then click it generate ckpt file. Then now&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=3051) I am going to load newly generated ckpt&nbsp; file. So to do that, just click refresh.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=3058) And it should come. And yes, it is. It has&nbsp; arrived. With now checkpointing that model.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=3065) It is done. And now we can do our tests. OK, I&nbsp; have generated over 600 images and some of them&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=3075) are really good and really resembling the face&nbsp; we teach it. So the key thing is that you need to&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=3083) generate more images with LoRA because I think it&nbsp; is not as precise as DreamBooth. The prompt I have&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=3091) used is portrait photo of brother SD 15, which is&nbsp; my prompt instance, with weight 1.2. 1.2 weight&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=3100) means that it will give more importance to this&nbsp; keyword. On the official page of Automatic1111&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=3108) Stable Diffusion web UI wiki features, You can&nbsp; see attention emphasis and it is explaining that&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=3115) how you can give more attention to each word.&nbsp; You can also use parentheses like this, or you&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=3122) can directly set importance like this. So it is&nbsp; totally up to you to use the either way. So I have&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=3130) given more importance to the prompt instance and&nbsp; I have also written photo of brother SD 15. And&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=3137) then I have used a generic keywords to generate&nbsp; images as close as to our prompt instance. You see&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=3146) 8K HDR, smooth, sharp focus cinematic. I am going&nbsp; to share all these keywords in the comments of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=3154) video, and I have also entered a lengthy negative&nbsp; prompt. I have used Eular a as a sampling method&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=3164) with 25 steps and the native resolution for SD 1.5&nbsp; 512 pixels. So how can you generate more than 100&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=3175) images? Set the batch count to 100, then go to&nbsp; bottom. Here. You will see the script section.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=3183) By default it is set to none, but you can go to&nbsp; prompts from file or text box and you can just&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=3190) copy and paste your prompt. So it will read&nbsp; each line and will continue generating images&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=3198) until all of the lines are executed. With this&nbsp; way, you can generate much more images. Also,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=3207) there are other options that you can do here. For&nbsp; example, you can do X and Y plots. So you can give&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=3215) X values and Y values and, if you wonder what they&nbsp; are, separate values for X axis, using commas.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=3222) You can play with these to, for example, generate&nbsp; different style images with having, let's say,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=3232) artist names or style names in your X values&nbsp; and the Y values would be like your regular&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=3240) prompt. Okay, so I have selected few of the images&nbsp; and now I will show you how to upscale them. The&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=3249) resemblance rate is not as good as DreamBooth,&nbsp; unfortunately. So you can also do DreamBooth&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=3256) training. The only thing different in DreamBooth&nbsp; training than the LoRA is in the advanced setup.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=3262) You just don't pick this LoRA and it will do&nbsp; DreamBooth training. And also be careful that&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=3267) when you are DreamBooth training it will generate&nbsp; 5GB files, 4GB files, at the each save checkpoint.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=3275) So you may want to reduce this, increase the&nbsp; save checkpoint frequency, not just 10, but maybe&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=3283) 50. It totally depends on your hardware hard&nbsp; drive. Okay, so what am I going to do is first&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=3290) let's check out the PNG info. Tap in here in&nbsp; pictures and in brother selected. Let's pick&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=3297) one of them. So you see Web UI embeds the meta&nbsp; information of the parameters. So if you can&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=3305) get the original image that is generated by the&nbsp; Web UI, you can just use PNG info to extract the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=3313) parameters from that image. And the one another&nbsp; thing I am going to show you is extras. In extras,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=3320) let's first try a single image. You can upscale&nbsp; it. Okay, the best upscaling algorithm I have&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=3328) found is R-ESRGAN 4x+. I pretty much like&nbsp; this. And let's upscale to 3X dimension. The&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=3339) first time you do. It may download something&nbsp; in here. Since I have done it previously,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=3344) it didn't download the necessary models.&nbsp; Okay, the upscaling is done. As you can see,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=3351) now this is upscaled version. You can also&nbsp; apply GFPGAN visibility. The GFPGAN will&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=3360) improve the face of a human. It is another&nbsp; model. Let's do that and see the difference.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=3370) Okay, it is getting done. And yes, so now you&nbsp; see it is more like a real human. This is fixing&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=3381) eyes much better, making the eyes much better if&nbsp; they are not oriented, if they are not symmetric.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=3389) So you may want to apply&nbsp; this as well, if you want.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=3394) And also you can do batch processing. For batch&nbsp; processing, just open the folder with Ctrl-A,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=3401) select all, open. It will be loaded like this.&nbsp; Then it will apply all of the parameters you&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=3408) set here and click generate. And all of the&nbsp; images will be generated as a batch. So the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=3418) results of the batch generation will be saved&nbsp; in a folder. If you want to open that folder,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=3423) just click this folder image here. You see open&nbsp; images output directory and the batch processing&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=3428) results will appear here. You can just directly&nbsp; copy them, paste them and do whatever you want.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=3437) Okay, this is all for today. Please&nbsp; ask any questions that you might have.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=3443) To improve the performance so I suggest you to&nbsp; use DreamBooth instead of the LoRA training. Also,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=3451) you can improve your data set. The data set,&nbsp; our data set, was not that very good. You see&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=3460) almost same time captured, same pose images.&nbsp; So if you add more variety to your data set,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=3468) you will obtain better results, more likely. And&nbsp; also, please like, share and subscribe our channel&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=3488) And I am hoping that you will support us as well.&nbsp; Hopefully, more videos, more advanced videos will&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=3495) come for Stable Diffusion. If you want to also&nbsp; learn something about Stable Diffusion, let me&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfaqqL5yOO4&t=3502) know by comments. And hopefully I will make videos&nbsp; about them. Hopefully, see you in another video.
