Hello everyone. In this video I code a fully multi-threaded C# application to batch process all of my images into newest best image format WEBP.

I am using C# programming language, .NET 4.8 framework, Aspose.Imaging library, and Google's cwebp and gif2webp.

I hope you enjoy, like and comment.

### Video Transcription


- [00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=2) Hello everyone, today I am going to make a program to reduce bandwidth usage of my web-based

- [00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=9) game that I developed.

- [00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=13) So you wonder what is that about?

- [00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=15) Recently I was checking my website speed with developers.google.com feature, which is page

- [00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=21) inside.

- [00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=23) Let me open it as English.

- [00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=29) Okay, so I am the developer of Monster MMORPG game, which is a browser-based game.

- [00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=36) You see this one.

- [00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=38) So I was checking the speed analysis of my website on page speed insights, and I have

- [00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=47) discovered that there is a new image format, which significantly reduces the image size

- [00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=56) that the image size of PNG or GPX.

- [00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=62) I am pretty sure you already know PNG or GPX.

- [00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=66) So you see the suggestions it is making is 12 images in next generation format, which

- [00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=75) is GPX, 2000GPX, XR or WebP.

- [00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=78) So in order to convert images on my website to WebP, I am going to develop a software.

- [00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=86) Okay, so this will be a real software that I will be using for my projects for my personal

- [00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=95) projects.

- [00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=96) And I wanted to record it so that you can also benefit from it.

- [00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=101) So let's start with Visual Studio Okay, and let's compose a new project.

- [00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=111) Create new project.

- [00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=113) I'm going to use vpf.net framework, you can also use dotnet core as well, it's fine.

- [00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=119) So the version will be 4.8 and I'm going to pick desktop as a development place.

- [00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=133) So let's name it as Convert to WebP Okay, let's create a project.

- [00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=142) I also have downloaded my static images from my web server.

- [00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=150) You see there are 1000s or 10s of 1000s of images.

- [00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=155) So manually converting them to WebP is extremely painful.

- [00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=160) Okay, so in order to convert images into WebP, I am going to use the WebP we can develop

- [00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=175) from Google WebP exit So let's go to the download page.

- [00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=183) And you see there is a C WebP encoder tool.

- [00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=187) It has some options and such.

- [00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=191) So we are going to call this exit from command window and convert our images Okay, so let's

- [00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=200) start with downloading it Where do we get there is Donald repository here.

- [00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=210) And from here, we are going to download latest version.

- [00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=215) You see they have so many versions, which is 1.2 point zero.

- [00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=221) And here, this one Windows x 64 Okay, and then there's our software exists here.

- [00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=234) So we are going to use C WebP exam.

- [00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=241) So let's open our debug folder here.

- [00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=248) And extract it C WebP here, okay.

- [00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=255) Alright, and let's start with initiating button.

- [00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=263) So this will be start converting name will be DTN button.

- [00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=278) And let's compose click event here.

- [00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=281) So first of all, we need to have a source directory and an output directory.

- [00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=290) Let's also name our project to convert WebP Okay, okay.

- [00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=304) So where is our source directories to have that let's define private static string as

- [00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=308) our source directory Okay, so my source directory will be here, my static source there are you

- [00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=319) see a lot of different files.

- [00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=324) So I will give this as my source.

- [00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=331) Of course, there will be type of images that cannot be converted to WebP.

- [00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=340) Okay like this, probably those would throw an error.

- [00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=346) Okay, so this will be our source directory.

- [00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=350) So where I want the output to be.

- [00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=354) I want output to be in desktop.

- [00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=358) So let's say converted images Okay, okay.

- [00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=365) You see you can make this totally, totally dynamic as well taking the source director

- [00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=381) from user with a directory picker and output director as well.

- [00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=392) But currently, I am not going to spend extra time for that.

- [00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=398) So first of all, we need to scan all of the images inside our source directory.

- [00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=405) Let's start with scanning the extensions, what kind of files we have in our directory.

- [00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=412) To that we are going to add using system dot IO, which is input output.

- [00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=418) And I'm going to use directory get files, though we will get source directory and our

- [00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=429) search pattern will be like this and search option will be all directory so it will also

- [00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=437) scan the let's say inner folders.

- [00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=444) So this will return you see a string array, which will include files, files, I'm going

- [00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=455) to put this inside another method so we can call it only one time private points, get

- [00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=463) file extensions Okay, so inside these files, we are going to get file extensions, we are

- [00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=473) file name and I think we can get file info or info equal to the file info which takes

- [00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=485) file name as this room is I think we can get extension of file for that tension here here.

- [00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=501) Okay, so which extensions to be have in our folders, I'm going to put that inside and

- [00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=513) I have said, okay, let's name it as let's just add it to the extension and we are file

- [00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=535) info dot extension is this a string or what?

- [00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=539) Yeah, this is a string.

- [00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=543) Okay.

- [00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=544) Then we will write it into a file file write all lines.

- [00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=553) Okay, and Pat will be found file extensions dot txt.

- [00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=560) So the content will be has extensions.

- [00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=563) Okay, however, since I have so many files, I would like to see the process.

- [00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=568) Okay, so let's add a first a label here.

- [00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=575) And I will name it as Libial process.

- [00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=578) And I will access this with a dispatcher.

- [00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=586) So let's also have static void set process label in our message.

- [00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=593) Okay, this will use Libial.

- [00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=598) Okay, you see, I am not able to access Libial process by in a static method because it seems

- [00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=605) it is in a main window and dispatcher begin invoke.

- [00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=611) Okay, this has some syntax that still I am not memorize it.

- [00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=620) So let's see the syntax from here quickly.

- [00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=626) Yeah, it takes action like this.

- [00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=633) Okay, so here Libial process dispatcher begin invoke new action.

- [00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=639) So this will set process content equal to as our message.

- [00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=645) So it takes a self executing action like this.

- [00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=648) Okay.

- [00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=649) And for this to work, I need to have task factor.

- [00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=655) I need to start this.

- [00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=657) I mean, for my interface to be responsive, and fully and I need to start this process

- [00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=664) as a new task.

- [00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=669) Okay.

- [00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=671) Here I will call this method and the task.

- [00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=676) Okay, and let's have a counter zero.

- [00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=683) And as we read the pro the file so we can person each of the divider is equal to zero,

- [00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=693) we will update the label.

- [00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=698) So how many files we have?

- [00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=704) My account will be equal to level.

- [00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=709) We are fires counts to length since the single dimension array we can use length and message

- [00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=722) will be Okay, let's say it's fired.

- [00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=730) Okay, I'll count or let's say processes fire.

- [00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=736) File in for process person will be equal to as a counter.

- [00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=752) Okay.

- [00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=755) And zero over photo accounts, which is the file count.

- [00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=765) Okay, here.

- [00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=768) And then we can also display the person as Okay, where is the problem here?

- [00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=781) Yeah, the problem has to be like this.

- [00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=789) And the person will be equal to over file count.

- [00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=798) This ring and two persons.

- [00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=804) Yeah.

- [00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=805) So why do I use use dividers?

- [00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=810) Because if I don't use this, it would take a lot of CPU time to try update label too

- [00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=824) frequently.

- [00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=826) Okay, everything looks fine.

- [00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=828) Let's start without debugging.

- [00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=830) So it will run faster.

- [00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=832) Okay, it was already too fast.

- [00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=837) Every file is open.

- [00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=839) Let's see which kind of extensions we have.

- [00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=842) Okay, we have XLS, HTML, echo, HTML config.

- [00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=845) And okay, so this is a file format that we would like to process.

- [00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=851) So we are going to process PNG, GPX and these PNG you see it's a bigger case that PNG.

- [00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=865) So we need to lowercase them.

- [00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=869) And yeah, so PNG and GPX.

- [00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=871) That's it.

- [00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=872) No other file format.

- [00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=874) However, there is a case where I have animated PNG files, a PNG and the C web exit is not

- [00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=892) available to process animated pages.

- [00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=898) So I will also have I will have a exception for them.

- [00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=909) Okay, so I am going to commit this out because we already learned the existing file extensions.

- [00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=915) Now I can start coding.

- [00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=918) Okay, so call it so private void start processing.

- [00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=927) So what this method is going to do is first it will get all files in source directory.

- [00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=936) Let's also have list.

- [00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=938) Okay, string, lsd process allowed extensions.

- [00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=946) Well, let's also have them as a string.

- [00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=950) So the allowed extensions are GPX and PNG.

- [00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=963) Okay, I will bypass the other file formats.

- [00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=972) I can also convert GIF images, I think.

- [00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=977) So for GIF images, we need to use.

- [00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=982) Let's open the file folders.

- [00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=989) Okay, we can use GIF to WebP.

- [00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=993) Yeah.

- [00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=994) Okay, I am not sure which options they take.

- [00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=999) So we need to experiment with this before starting this experiment with it.

- [00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=1007) Okay, so I have already my command GIF to WebP.

- [00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=1017) Okay, example.

- [00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=1025) So it takes options input file GIF and output file.

- [00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=1029) Yeah, that's it.

- [00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=1031) What else?

- [00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=1032) The options are lossy, mixed queue float.

- [00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=1035) Okay, I have queue float as 100 already in size.

- [00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=1046) It uses lossy compression by default.

- [00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=1076) Okay, we can also include this mean size and int.

- [00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=1087) What is this?

- [00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=1094) I think I

- [00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=1108) will manually convert them.

- [00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=1113) Okay, lossy, lose quality 70, mean size.

- [00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=1124) Okay, what does this option do?

- [00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=1133) I am not sure.

- [00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=1135) Let's get some more information regarding that.

- [00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=1144) Okay.

- [00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=1146) Let's look for mean size.

- [00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=1157) Actually, the option was like this, yeah.

- [00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=1176) We can check the help page of WebP, which is, where was it?

- [00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=1187) Kits repository.

- [00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=1188) They have some mailing list perhaps.

- [00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=1193) Here, yeah.

- [00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=1195) So here, I already have asked a question here.

- [00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=1199) So mean size.

- [00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=1212) Okay, let's see.

- [00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=1249) Okay.

- [00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=1261) I see so we can use min size.

- [00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=1264) Okay.

- [00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=1265) This is not very important right now, so first we will scan all of the files.

- [00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=1271) Okay.

- [00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=1272) Like here's and then we will scan the files, let's say we are source files.

- [00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=1281) We will scan the files in output direct directory.

- [00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=1291) Alright so output directory we are target files.

- [00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=1299) Okay.

- [00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=1303) And this will use output directory.

- [00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=1308) And then we will get which files are not processed.

- [00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=1317) In order to do that we need to do a check.

- [00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=1327) So this is an array so I will make this into a list so that I can remove them like this.

- [00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=1332) And this will be also a list.

- [00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=1342) Okay so I also need to have extra list yeah.

- [00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=1350) Yeah so okay actually this doesn't have to be list.

- [00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=1358) We are target files real paths.

- [00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=1368) So this will be we are target files dot select here replace sr output directory this.

- [00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=1383) So what will this do?

- [00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=1387) With this approach I will be able to compare which files are already processed or not.

- [00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=1398) So our application will be able to restart.

- [00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=1402) We are source files real paths okay it will be like this.

- [00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=1418) Okay and then we are going to have this okay.

- [00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=1431) Okay and we are files to process.

- [00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=1434) It will be we are target files paths and what was it accept yeah.

- [00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=1452) Accept takes another enumerable list.

- [00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=1458) So source and target yeah it will be like this.

- [00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=1462) Okay then we will get it as it is okay.

- [00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=1475) And then we will get this as select yeah.

- [00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=1484) Okay source directory plus oh we don't need this yeah we don't need this okay.

- [00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=1492) So now that we have obtained it our files we can use parallel for each.

- [00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=1505) Okay so parallel for each has some special formats.

- [00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=1521) Okay parallel for each it uses a source which will be this then it uses an action.

- [00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=1534) I am not sure how was the format let me find it.

- [00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=1543) So that we can have a multi threading yeah something like this.

- [00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=1552) We also need a parallel option or pair options like this pair options dot or let's make it

- [00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=1568) pair options key options okay the max degree of parallelism let's make it eight.

- [00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=1578) I have 16 core CPU by the way and it will be enumerating inside your files to process

- [00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=1585) okay.

- [00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=1586) And inside this I will call another method private void um processing a file.

- [00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=1599) It will take as our original path like this and I also need to provide the parallel option

- [00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=1613) here your file name okay it will start this file as a new process yeah.

- [00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=1626) By the way this may change so let's assign it to local.

- [00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=1630) It should change yeah never mind it and here we are going to start a process command line

- [00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=1648) process so it will use process not start so it takes file name arguments using okay.

- [00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=1670) So process starts takes file name and in order to achieve that we need to also have an id

- [00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=1681) so to have concurrency let's say private static let's make it as ir file counter will be zero

- [00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=1697) integers and with each file we will have interlocket we will use interlocket method this is for

- [00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=1713) achieving concurrency.

- [00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=1715) Okay how we're going to do that is okay interlocket increment your file counters then let's define

- [00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=1731) the file name file name will be equal to interlocket read file counters.

- [00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=1749) I am thinking that can there be same file name actually instead of interlocket I will

- [00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=1759) use a private locking object yeah yeah not this one let's also define it private static

- [00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=1771) object okay obviously let's say lock for file name new object so I will lock this object

- [00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=1783) to increment my file counter and compare it's file name lock okay lock file name file Okay

- [00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=1814) it appears that I have forgotten to unpause the video so what I did is I have written

- [00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=1857) a piece of code to test before that let me one okay sorry about this confusion what I

- [00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=1868) did is when I have forgotten to unpause the video is simply I have coded a test button

- [00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=1874) and the test button is using our original static file cmd and gif file cmd and I also

- [00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=1887) fixed something in gif file cmd which is I have removed the loses command because it

- [00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=1894) was giving an error now they are working I am using a wait for exists so let me show

- [00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=1900) you how it works okay okay let me start test so the first process is started it is taking

- [00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=1912) some time because that image is pretty big then it is starting the other one and now

- [00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=1918) they are generated okay so you see original file is 820 kilobytes and let's see how much

- [00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=1927) did we gain okay so 820 minus 572 over 820 you see 30 percent gain we have in this file

- [00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=1941) it is significant and it has zero difference how

- [00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=1950) can I be so sure about that we can be sure about that with a comparison okay so I am

- [00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=1958) going to only make a single line of single pixel of difference here on this web p file

- [00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=1967) and I will save it as a test on my desktop here as a png so I will name it as test to

- [00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=1976) png okay and then I will save my original file as test png on the desktop here then

- [00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=1987) I will use online comparison website let me show you compare image difference okay there

- [00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=1997) are several pages for that so first try with diff checker diff checker is awesome website

- [00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=2003) believe me okay so when I see check the difference there is a single line of difference here

- [00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=2010) on this image so how they achieve this I wonder yeah so here when I hover and when I zoom

- [00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=2025) in okay like this you see there is a single line a single pixel of difference here and

- [00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=2033) no other differences it is exactly same and let's compare with another website okay online

- [00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=2046) diff so first image and the second image so I will make the fuzziness zero and it will

- [00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=2055) show as a red color okay so on this image there is a single pixel difference here which

- [00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=2062) is what I have made and there is no other red dot okay so I can copy this image to zoom

- [00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=2070) in so you see there is no other red dot because they are exactly same except the single line

- [00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=2080) single pixel that I have made myself so basically we gain 35 percent 30 percent size in this

- [00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=2091) image and on this gift image we gained from minus to 26.9 over this 35 percent you see

- [00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=2109) with on the gift image we gain 35 percent and let's test if they are working or not

- [00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=2117) so this is our WebP GIF and this is our iponic GIF this is original GIF file and this is

- [00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=2128) WebP file they are looking pretty much same to me we can also use some online websites

- [00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=2141) online GIF to WebP there is one website which I have found working very well this one or

- [00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=2150) yeah let's try this I think it was this one so let's open our debug test so here our GIF

- [00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=2164) upload it then you see there is losing compression mixed compression I unmark them and convert

- [00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=2173) the WebP so this website generated a little bit higher kilobyte because probably it is

- [00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=2180) not using the best compression and that's it okay so we are able to properly convert

- [00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=2189) GIF and static PNG and probably GPX as well we haven't tested GPX so let's also test the

- [00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=2198) GPX for example yeah this wallpaper it's pretty big so it will probably take a lot of time

- [00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=2214) okay let's copy and paste this okay so I will remove this probably we don't even need it

- [00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=2230) right now what is the file name it is this I am not sure if it if it can produce better

- [00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=2241) than GPX because GPX is already losing compression as you know okay let's try it so all processes

- [00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=2256) started at the same time because we are not waiting them and they are running right now

- [00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=2265) as they get completed it will close the window and why it takes so long is that we are using

- [00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=2280) the best possible algorithm and let's see the output okay so yes the WebP file is bigger

- [00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=2291) than the original GPX it is because GPX is already losing and when I save this GPX as

- [00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=2302) a PNG let's see the size okay size of the PNG is this we can of course optimize it a

- [00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=2313) little bit more with PNG out win and I am pretty sure there will be still significant

- [00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=2321) difference between PNG version and WebP version this is a software that I have purchased to

- [00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=2329) optimize my PNG files previously but it is not anymore necessary because now we can use

- [00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=2337) WebP format which is much better format okay so this software is single threaded on a single

- [00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=2350) image so it is taking some time it has so many passes okay so the optimized PNG file

- [00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=2359) is 2.53 megabytes and minus 1.52 megabytes over or not this one actually since GPX files

- [00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=2375) are already losing we shouldn't convert them to WebP probably we we cannot we cannot achieve

- [00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=2388) same quality I wonder if there is an losing but no point of converting GPX into WebP let

- [00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=2401) me check that first okay okay same quality for GPX I think we need to have some losing

- [00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=2443) compression probably for GPX compression we need to use some other methodology so let's

- [00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=2512) see which which options we can use okay let's see okay so there is version loses near loses

- [00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=2543) int so we can use near loses for GPX I think okay so which which option should we use I'm

- [00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=2588) not sure I think I will try near loses

- [00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=2602) yeah let's try it with so for that I'm going to have another file it will be for GPX for

- [00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=2616) GPX I'm going to remove loses and change it with near loses with zero and I think I have

- [00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=2636) to remove z9 as well so yeah I have to remove z9 okay let's try this way for GPX okay and

- [00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=2662) this is the file name okay let's test GPX SR or a GPX and let's comment out this is

- [00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=2687) and let's make it like this yeah okay let's see what kind of results we are going to get

- [00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=2701) with GPX command

- [00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=2720) okay so it is done oh wow now we have a better result than original GPX so let's compare

- [00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=2732) two images quality of course I am not expecting them to be same yeah I can see the difference

- [00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=2740) there is already some difference but I am not sure if we have lost some quality or not

- [00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=2758) yeah we have lost some quality as you can see definitely and it is not small as well

- [00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=2771) okay I wonder if it is possible to compress GPX losing quality is this even possible I'm

- [00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=2808) not sure compress GPX okay okay So, what happens if we modify our command file

- [00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=2868) options for GPX such as this.

- [00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=2873) Let's test it.

- [00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=2876) I have to restart the application because it is reading that cmd file at the beginning.

- [00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=2884) That quality loss files are significant when we zoom it in.

- [00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=2890) We have lost a lot of quality.

- [00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=2905) Here are GPX and here are PNG.

- [00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=2909) By the way, when you convert GPX to PNG, you don't lose any quality.

- [00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=2915) So, they are exactly the same.

- [00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=2920) And when we convert WebP with losing compression, okay, now it is bigger than that and we probably

- [00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=2930) even lost some quality.

- [00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=2933) Wow, it looks almost the same.

- [00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=2940) Yeah, looks like this has fixed the problem.

- [00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=2944) So, if we make it 90%, probably we can get almost the same.

- [00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=2956) Let's zoom the same, yeah, looks pretty much the same to me.

- [00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=2965) Yeah, almost kept everything, however, it is still over the original GPX, so we can

- [00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=2971) make it something like 95%.

- [00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=2975) Let's try the 95%, okay.

- [00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=3000) Little bigger than original GPX, so let's try 90% or this, where it is, here, okay.

- [00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=3052) Okay, so 90% didn't make much difference.

- [00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=3062) Okay, so let's test with default settings.

- [00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=3069) So, to do that, I'm just going to remove all these options.

- [00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=3079) And I wonder what kind of result we are going to get.

- [00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=3082) Okay, without those options, I think.

- [00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=3088) Okay, it was so fast and it is now so small size, however, what kind of result we have?

- [00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=3105) Wow, significant quality of loss, quality loss, okay, let me show you.

- [00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=3115) For example, 1900 zoom, now you see how much detail we have lost, yeah.

- [00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=3130) For example, here, we can compare the M words, M letter actually, okay, so let's zoom to

- [00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=3142) same, you see, how blurry it looks when compared to this, so removing options doesn't help.

- [00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=3158) Maybe let's make both of these 95%, I'm not sure which one of them is, really does make

- [00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=3167) a difference, okay, still bigger than the original, so let's try 90% for both, okay,

- [00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=3202) so here's still same, so let's try 85%, I'm not sure what kind of result we're going to

- [00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=3223) get, wow, it is bigger than the original file.

- [00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=3230) So maybe 80%.

- [00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=3247) Let's move this and only keep this quality, wow, the size is suddenly got too small, okay,

- [00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=3281) so let's make this 95%, oh no, let's make this 100% and remove near losses and see what

- [00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=3300) happens, okay, so this is a decent size and let's have a comparison with original image

- [00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=3314) quality, here, original image and here 100% quality, okay, from the first impression,

- [00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=3325) they look pretty much same, so let's zoom in and see the quality, okay, 1000, 1000 here,

- [00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=3343) okay, oh, I see the quality loss, you see, there is a loss of colors, yeah, when we zoom

- [00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=3371) out, okay, it is not very much visible when we zoom out, though, still there is some loss,

- [00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=3396) but I would say pretty insignificant, yeah, almost looking same, which has very good amount

- [00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=3403) of compression, so let's zoom in the eye, zoom in like this, okay, here, yeah, I see

- [00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=3426) some loss of colors, it is just the color tone is loss, I think, not the detail itself,

- [00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=3448) let's also try online conversion and what they produce, so this is the original file

- [00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=3464) and convert webp, so it has generated, I think, the same file as we have, this is the original

- [00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=3486) file, wow, this also has kept colors, oh, this is weird, our algorithm changes the colors,

- [00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=3499) but online didn't change them, wow, this is so wrong for us, yeah, okay, I still see some

- [00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=3517) difference here, here and here, hmm, I see, so these two are the really different ones,

- [00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=3544) okay, let's see, hmm, it is still not the same, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay,

- [00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=3578) okay, hmm, let's look for the options again, options, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay,

- [00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=3596) options Let's add this Let's add this alpha.

- [01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=3613) I wonder if it will make any difference.

- [01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=3626) Let's make alpha 100 So we are trying to lose as minimal as possible quality and achieve

- [01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=3636) some Okay, it is probably same Okay, it is probably same Okay, it is probably same Okay,

- [01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=3644) it is probably same Okay, it is probably same Colors are changing you see This is the original

- [01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=3653) file and this is the WebP output Colors are changing you see This is the original file

- [01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=3656) and this is the WebP output Okay, so let's add it Hello world This品牌語詞 invested

- [01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=3677) western 挽回 挽回 挽回 挽回 挽回 挽回 挽回 挽回 挽回 挽回 挽回

- [01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=3698) 挽回 挽回 挽回 挽回 挽回 挽回 Okay, let's try this option.

- [01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=3712) This is interesting.

- [01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=3716) Is it generating height?

- [01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=3721) No, it's not.

- [01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=3725) Yeah.

- [01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=3727) Let's

- [01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=3789) also open this tab.

- [01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=3792) Let's open this tab, features.

- [01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=3797) I don't know if this is making any difference.

- [01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=3817) The only option that makes change is actually this, near loss.

- [01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=3830) When I make it, it increases the quality, processing time, but size as well.

- [01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=3850) Yeah, taking a lot of time.

- [01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=3888) They are almost same size, and let's see.

- [01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=3903) So this is the original file.

- [01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=3912) I see now you see colors are kept almost as same.

- [01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=3920) Yeah.

- [01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=3921) Pretty much similar.

- [01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=3922) So if we reduce a little bit more the losses to 75% maybe we can get a smaller size yet

- [01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=3932) almost same quality for GPX.

- [01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=3944) Let's also have another test image to see if it is working or not.

- [01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=3951) Okay, game wallpaper.

- [01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=3955) So from here something big, for example.

- [01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=3967) Let's try this one.

- [01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=3969) Oh, this is PNG.

- [01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=3972) So let's sort by size.

- [01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=3976) Oh, I see this is the biggest file I have.

- [01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=3980) I wonder where I have this.

- [01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=3984) Yeah, now it is smaller in size yet probably very similar in quality.

- [01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=4000) So let's open both and have 2000 zoom in.

- [01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=4012) Let's make it 3000.

- [01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=4015) 3000.

- [01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=4019) Wow, almost same.

- [01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=4023) Yeah, pretty much looking same.

- [01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=4028) There is still some difference.

- [01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=4031) For example, this original and this is the other one.

- [01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=4035) I still see some difference, though they're almost exactly same.

- [01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=4043) So when I zoom in the eye like this.

- [01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=4050) Okay, yeah, pretty much looking same.

- [01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=4058) Yeah.

- [01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=4060) Okay, I think we can use these settings.

- [01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=4066) So let's test with our.

- [01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=4070) Oh, this is our biggest GPX by the way.

- [01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=4074) Let's test with another GPX.

- [01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=4077) So this one.

- [01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=4081) I have to close this open exam files by the way.

- [01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=4086) Because I will be need to recompile.

- [01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=4092) Okay, so I will change the name.

- [01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=4107) Okay, where is it?

- [01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=4119) We didn't change the output.

- [01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=4134) No, we did.

- [01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=4143) Oh, did it have a problem?

- [01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=4157) Purple GPX and purple WebP.

- [01:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=4159) Wow, the software thrown error I guess.

- [01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=4165) Okay, this is a file it is generating.

- [01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=4172) What happened?

- [01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=4176) Oh, here.

- [01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=4183) Okay, it is lower in size.

- [01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=4190) Let's compare image quality.

- [01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=4192) By the way, these are very old images made by my players.

- [01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=4197) So wow, almost looking same.

- [01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=4203) I don't see any difference.

- [01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=4204) Let's compare and I hear.

- [01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=4209) Yeah, almost same.

- [01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=4215) Okay, so now we have our settings.

- [01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=4225) Now we can continue our programming.

- [01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=4233) Okay.

- [01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=4234) So what we are going to do is we are going to process non-processed files.

- [01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=4249) And we have file name.

- [01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=4251) Okay, let's we need to read file info.

- [01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=4255) So to do that, let's use using.

- [01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=4259) File info, my file equal to the file info from the source I entered plus I think.

- [01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=4266) Yeah, with the original path.

- [01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=4269) Okay, looks like file input is not implicitly disposable.

- [01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=4275) So we just can use like this.

- [01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=4279) And then if my file extension string.

- [01:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=4284) The lower.

- [01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=4288) Is equal to ng.

- [01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=4292) String.

- [01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=4294) String sr content of cmd will be equal to.

- [01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=4306) Or let's make it like this.

- [01:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=4309) Okay, or original cmd.

- [01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=4313) Let's assign it to sr.

- [01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=4319) Original.

- [01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=4321) Topic cmd.

- [01:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=4325) Let's assign each of each one of them.

- [01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=4328) I will use a switch actually.

- [01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=4337) Okay, if list allowed extensions contains.

- [01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=4340) Your file extension.

- [01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=4344) And let's have a switch.

- [01:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=4345) Your file extension and.

- [01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=4348) This will be png.

- [01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=4351) Brick and original.

- [01:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=4354) md file will be like this.

- [01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=4361) For gpx.

- [01:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=4363) It will be sr gpx file and.

- [01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=4375) Post.

- [01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=4380) Give.

- [01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=4385) It will be original gif file.

- [01:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=4389) Yeah, okay.

- [01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=4391) Alright, so there is still one problem that we need to solve, which is.

- [01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=4400) Converting animated.

- [01:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=4402) Png file.

- [01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=4404) So to do that.

- [01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=4407) What we need to do is.

- [01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=4409) We need to generate another folder.

- [01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=4414) As.

- [01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=4416) Output directory by the way output directory will be.

- [01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=4423) Converted images.

- [01:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=4426) Like this.

- [01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=4432) And output.

- [01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=4433) Let's say as animated.

- [01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=4440) Directory.

- [01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=4442) It will be like this, yeah.

- [01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=4445) Animated or let's say.

- [01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=4449) Animated.

- [01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=4451) Why I am going to have this folder because I want to.

- [01:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=4455) Save them in another folder than to process later manually.

- [01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=4461) OK, then we will generate our.

- [01:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=4473) Exporting folders.

- [01:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=4474) To do that, first we need to generate files or directory.

- [01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=4482) Create directory so directory will be.

- [01:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=4492) It may automatically create the directory I am not sure.

- [01:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=4514) Hmm.

- [01:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=4519) OK, let's try it and see if it is working or not.

- [01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=4527) I'm not sure if it if it doesn't, we will have to generate folders.

- [01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=4531) Manually, so this is our original CMD file.

- [01:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=4537) OK, string is our content.

- [01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=4539) It will be equal to.

- [01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=4541) I am string.format.

- [01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=4544) So the format will be original CMD file, whatever it is.

- [01:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=4552) Then we will provide input.

- [01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=4557) So input will be my file simply.

- [01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=4560) Actually, I need to provide this path.

- [01:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=4564) Let's provide it like this, yeah.

- [01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=4569) And then we will have target as our.

- [01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=4575) Output.

- [01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=4578) Directory plus.

- [01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=4584) The original path, yeah.

- [01:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=4589) And then we will start process single file or we are already inside processing a file,

- [01:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=4597) so we will just.

- [01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=4599) Start process start.

- [01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=4601) About first, we need to write it, I'll write.

- [01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=4607) All text, so the file name is.

- [01:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=4614) Here.

- [01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=4618) Process start file name.

- [01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=4622) It's our content.

- [01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=4625) I also need to wait process here.

- [01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=4628) That's equal to this.

- [01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=4631) OK, then wait for exist and delete file.

- [01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=4637) So our folder won't get.

- [01:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=4641) Filled up.

- [01:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=4643) That's it.

- [01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=4644) Let's start with.

- [01:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=4653) Single parallelism.

- [01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=4656) And which file we get.

- [01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=4661) Oh, we didn't call this yet, so.

- [01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=4667) Simply we will call as this.

- [01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=4671) And yeah.

- [01:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=4672) So currently we are just testing our algorithm is working or not.

- [01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=4678) So the original pet is abilities new XLS.

- [01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=4684) It is directly on the folder, so file name is like this file extension is XLS.

- [01:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=4690) And since it is not inside a load extension.

- [01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=4697) So we will do if check here, basically.

- [01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=4704) Return.

- [01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=4707) OK, so let's directly jump here.

- [01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=4715) OK, so the file name is this one.

- [01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=4725) It is inside pubicons.

- [01:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=4727) So our source directory plus pet.

- [01:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=4729) Yeah, it looks correct.

- [01:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=4732) Output directory that's pet.

- [01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=4735) OK, so.

- [01:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=4737) What error did we have?

- [01:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=4740) One moment.

- [01:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=4744) OK, we have problem.

- [01:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=4750) Oh, I also need to provide as our source directory.

- [01:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=4757) Yeah, now it should work.

- [01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=4760) OK, so this is the content.

- [01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=4764) Let's check it out.

- [01:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=4765) Oh, this is the pet of the exam.

- [01:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=4768) Oh, it has double.

- [01:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=4773) I think this can cause some problem.

- [01:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=4776) Is interesting why it is written like that.

- [01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=4790) Maybe it is because of here.

- [01:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=4800) Not source directory.

- [01:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=4805) Yeah, this is our working directory.

- [01:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=4812) Yeah.

- [01:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=4813) Now let's try again.

- [01:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=4815) So the content is, yeah, looking correct.

- [01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=4821) OK, petting looking correct.

- [01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=4824) So you see it should automatically generate pubicons folder.

- [01:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=4827) I'm not sure if it will or not.

- [01:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=4830) So let's start the process.

- [01:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=4834) OK, this process starts.

- [01:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=4838) No, I don't see the process or it is already completed.

- [01:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=4846) So let's check it out.

- [01:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=4851) No.

- [01:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=4852) So let's try again.

- [01:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=4858) OK, and now we should be able to see the CMD file.

- [01:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=4864) Let's see why this is not working.

- [01:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=4871) Error, cannot open output file, yeah.

- [01:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=4890) So I have to generate output folder.

- [01:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=4899) How am I going to do that is, yeah, let's try this way.

- [01:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=4917) I'm not sure if it will work or not, or not test.

- [01:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=4920) And let's see if the directory is composed.

- [01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=4926) Yes.

- [01:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=4927) OK, this is working, then OK, started, exited.

- [01:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=4933) And our favicon is generated as PNG, yeah.

- [01:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=4938) So we have a problem with, yeah, I have to replace original path.

- [01:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=4950) How am I going to do that is, hmmm, bilbash, hmmm, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,

- [01:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=4979) yeah.

- [01:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=4981) I need to change its extension, how am I going to do that is, I think I can change its extension

- [01:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=4991) as replace extension with, yeah, this should work.

- [01:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=5015) And I just found another problem, so I will replace that, but not only that, I also need

- [01:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=5028) to remove extension, split, false, then we

- [01:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=5052) will add it to our file.

- [01:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=5058) File to process, how, like this, hmmm, I also need to remove, yeah, I need to remove original

- [01:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=5079) file path with source directory, hmmm, yeah, OK, so let's start with single threaded and

- [01:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=5094) let's see if our application is working or not, OK, we have a problem.

- [01:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=5101) So, if an extension is empty, hmmm, OK, so if there is no extension then we just need

- [01:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=5124) to bypass it, OK, so, OK, our modification started, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,

- [01:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=5159) yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

- [01:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=5177) ok file icons are finished so let's control our process code is working because we want

- [01:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=5194) our application to be continueable ok so we have target as these fab icons and images

- [01:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=5204) account icons yeah so here we get modified name as abilities new and if target contains

- [01:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=5214) we are going to edit so we are files to process contains all of these they should not ok 65

- [01:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=5224) thousand 129 and how many we have yeah so I think yeah it is continuing with account

- [01:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=5236) items so it has bypassed the file icons so it is working we can say that by the way we

- [01:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=5245) can also minimize this because you see it is taking our space so let's remove it and

- [01:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=5256) we also still have one more thing p-chart detect animated png how do we identify if

- [01:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=5271) it is animated png or not ok let's say c-sharp check if png is animated ok ok ok Okay, there

- [01:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=5371) is ImageMagicNet, I think it has some animated PNG checking.

- [01:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=5380) I also asked it some questions here, but...

- [01:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=5386) RPNG.

- [01:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=5389) Check if PNG is animated.

- [01:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=5401) This is PHP.

- [01:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=5408) Okay, there is ImageMagicNet, I think it has some animated PNG checking.

- [01:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=5475) This is how to find if PNG is animated.

- [01:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=5503) Why I cannot...

- [01:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=5505) Why no one has asked this question, I wonder?

- [01:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=5537) Okay, I think to figure it out, I will use... an extension, ImageMagicNet here.

- [01:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=5559) Okay, so I think we can install this.

- [01:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=5579) Okay, ImageMagicNet.

- [01:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=5593) Okay, let's look for...

- [01:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=5620) Okay, let's first test an animated image as...

- [01:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=5637) For magic collection, we need to add using magic.

- [01:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=5639) And I need to get an example animated image from my static folder images.

- [01:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=5652) Actually, I don't have that, so let's look it from my another website.

- [01:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=5666) Okay, and...

- [01:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=5671) I will just make a fake registration.

- [01:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=5689) Okay, so...

- [01:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=5695) For example, let's test this image as...

- [01:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=5708) Test, okay.

- [01:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=5713) So for this, I need to provide full path working directory plus test and...

- [01:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=5757) PNG, yeah.

- [01:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=5777) Yeah, I know the reason because I have to make it like this.

- [01:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=5790) Okay, and now...

- [01:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=5793) Number of images is one and here does it show channel count four.

- [01:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=5808) How can we find out whether it is animated or not?

- [01:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=5819) Okay, maybe this is not working.

- [01:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=5828) Let's look for another one, APNG.

- [01:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=5834) Animated PNG creator, let's look for this package.

- [01:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=5847) Let's get the report of this, where it is.

- [01:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=5856) Okay, this is hard to find.

- [01:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=5895) Okay, let's look for another one, APNG.

- [01:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=5940) Okay, let's look for another one, APNG.

- [01:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=5973) Okay, there is APNG.

- [01:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=5990) And this is so old.

- [01:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=6053) PNG CS.

- [01:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=6111) Is this the same thing here?

- [01:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=6141) Okay, let's look for another one, APNG.

- [01:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=6147) Okay, let's look for another one, APNG.

- [01:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=6153) Okay, let's look for another one, APNG.

- [01:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=6158) Okay, let's look for another one.

- [01:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=6161) Oh, there is an API for net imaging API.

- [01:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=6169) What does this do?

- [01:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=6177) Supported formats.

- [01:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=6181) Yeah, okay, it is supported.

- [01:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=6191) So how does it work?

- [01:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=6198) Let's install this ASPOS, okay.

- [01:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=6206) Here, let's install it.

- [01:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=6213) And how do we use it?

- [01:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=6223) Okay, there is a code like this.

- [01:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=6226) And let's see what does that generate for us.

- [01:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=6230) Okay, so I need to set ASPOS image using...

- [01:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=6240) Okay, I am giving compact.

- [01:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=6266) I wonder if it can read the...

- [01:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=6272) Okay, where is gg?

- [01:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=6282) Okay, it is loaded.

- [01:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=6285) So, okay.

- [01:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=6286) So you see it is showing the format right now as APNG image.

- [01:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=6289) However, this is pretty slow if you ask me.

- [01:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=6300) So does it show other things?

- [01:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=6302) I think there is page count, width head, timeout, vertical resolution.

- [01:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=6314) File format, yeah, file format is APNG.

- [01:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=6328) Okay.

- [01:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=6340) Yeah, probably I can't have that file format type.

- [01:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=6357) Okay, looks like my only option is using this to determine if it is APNG or not.

- [01:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=6367) So I will also implement that to my logic, which will be here.

- [01:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=6376) So in case of it is PNG extension, I will have extra code here and I will provide full

- [01:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=6385) path.

- [01:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=6389) Like this and if, okay, image.

- [01:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=6410) File format equal to APNG.

- [01:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=6414) You see there are also other types.

- [01:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=6416) It's pretty slow, but no way.

- [01:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=6421) Then I will save it to do another folder as...

- [01:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=6426) Like this.

- [01:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=6429) File not the same.

- [01:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=6435) Right, or copy, yeah.

- [01:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=6441) The destination will be like this, yeah.

- [01:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=6454) SR output animated directory, yeah.

- [01:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=6460) Although I am not sure if this will work or not.

- [01:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=6465) By the way, I also need to composites directory so...

- [01:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=6473) File info.

- [01:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=6478) PNG file info.

- [01:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=6487) Okay, so everything is looking like ready.

- [01:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=6496) So let's try it.

- [01:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=6505) By the way, I will change source directory for quick testing of APNG.

- [01:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=6512) It is inside trainers here.

- [01:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=6517) Wow, okay, it went inside MPC trainers.

- [01:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=6521) And currently I don't have any animated trainer here, so...

- [01:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=6535) I will get here some, I will pause a bit.

- [01:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=6540) Okay, now I have added some animated images to here.

- [01:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=6547) You see there are over 8000 items.

- [01:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=6552) So I am going to change source directory into MPC trainers.

- [01:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=6560) To test my APNG if it is working or not.

- [01:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=6567) And let's start converting.

- [01:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=6571) Oh, since I have connected it, it is stopped.

- [01:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=6583) So let's close this.

- [01:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=6586) Okay, let's also modify our process start.

- [01:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=6592) Start, minimize it.

- [01:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=6595) How can we start it, minimize it.

- [01:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=6605) Okay, so how do we start AMD, minimize it.

- [01:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=6614) Okay, there is new process, file name, arguments.

- [01:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=6631) Okay.

- [01:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=6637) I think this can work, yeah.

- [01:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=6643) So where do we start it, we start it here.

- [01:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=6647) So we have a process start info, that is like this.

- [01:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=6653) We don't have a working directory.

- [01:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=6657) You make it minimize it, then we use var my process.

- [01:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=6665) I will of course comment this out.

- [01:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=6668) Okay, now they should be minimized.

- [01:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=6672) Okay, still they are getting.

- [01:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=6677) You see, open it like this.

- [01:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=6688) Converted images.

- [01:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=6691) Okay, since it is root directory taking, it is being like a root directory like this.

- [01:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=6700) I mean not inside images and MPG trainers because we have changed the root directory.

- [01:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=6706) Okay, it is pretty fast, so we can just wait.

- [01:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=6715) I will close this window.

- [01:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=6721) And how much GPU is being used.

- [01:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=6727) Let's open task manager.

- [01:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=6730) Yeah, I am at 30% right now.

- [01:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=6736) I think I can even make it faster.

- [01:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=6742) Currently it is 8.

- [01:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=6748) Or single, let's check it out.

- [01:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=6754) Okay, max degrow parallelism is currently 1, so let's change it to.

- [01:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=6766) Let's make it 3.

- [01:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=6770) And let's see how much CPU do we use.

- [01:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=6776) Okay, now we are using 60.

- [01:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=6785) So there is still some space to increase max degrow parallelism like 5.

- [01:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=6794) Okay, and then.

- [01:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=6797) Okay.

- [01:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=6798) So we are able to utilize most of my CPU.

- [01:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=6817) Okay, and currently we are not able to see the process, so let's also see the process

- [01:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=6827) as well.

- [01:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=6829) If I can stop the application.

- [01:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=6832) Okay, so to be able to see how many files we have processed.

- [01:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=6841) I think we can use file counter.

- [01:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=6848) And yeah.

- [01:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=6852) And how many files we have to process.

- [01:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=6861) I think we can display it here, set this label and process it.

- [01:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=6873) This may not be 100% precise but it should work.

- [01:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=6882) Okay, by the way, since this is a special character, let's make it like this.

- [01:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=6892) Wow, so many files remaining.

- [01:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=6898) I think it is getting processed again and again.

- [01:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=6910) Yeah, we have a logic problem.

- [01:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=6915) Yeah, the logic problem is caused by this extension so we need to add it to our converted

- [01:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=6925) images as well.

- [01:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=6927) Now, when we restart.

- [01:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=6933) Oh, since it is not done yet.

- [01:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=6939) Anyway, I know that which images are converted or not, so I will just delete most of them

- [01:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=6950) because we don't need most of them.

- [01:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=6954) They are starting from like 15,000.

- [01:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=6968) So let's just delete them all.

- [01:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=6982) Okay.

- [01:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=6984) Okay, around 3000 is left.

- [01:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=6993) Okay, let's start converting.

- [01:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=6998) Okay, I should get into this.

- [01:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=7007) By the way, this image loading is also taking some time for sure.

- [01:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=7015) Alright.

- [01:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=7019) It's pretty fast because these are small sized images, so it is expected to be fast.

- [01:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=7040) You see they are getting written here.

- [01:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=7051) We can also compare their size, but we have that at the end.

- [01:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=7060) Let's open the last folder.

- [01:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=7065) I think it should have come already.

- [01:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=7072) But I still don't see it.

- [01:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=7081) Let's put a breakpoint here to see if it is working or not.

- [01:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=7094) I can't even put a breakpoint here because you see this is getting focused.

- [01:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=7101) Why it is not working?

- [01:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=7117) Wow, we might have a problem somewhere around here.

- [01:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=7127) Let's put a breakpoint here too.

- [01:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=7135) Oh, we have a problem here.

- [01:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=7138) This has to be.png,.gpx, and.gif.

- [01:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=7144) You see you may always have some problems.

- [01:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=7150) And now we have to restart.

- [01:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=7152) Okay, I also will do something else.

- [01:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=7155) C sharp command process is getting focused.

- [01:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=7159) I don't want that.

- [01:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=7161) Maybe it can be somewhere around here, let's see.

- [01:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=7173) Process start info.

- [01:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=7175) Okay, focus.

- [01:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=7176) Is there any focus or something?

- [01:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=7181) There is great no window here.

- [01:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=7182) Let's set this as cool I think.

- [01:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=7197) Default is false.

- [01:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=7199) Okay, now we should not see any window.

- [02:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=7203) Okay.

- [02:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=7204) Oh, why?

- [02:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=7205) Oh, it was fast.

- [02:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=7208) So now outputs are animated.

- [02:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=7211) Original path is this.

- [02:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=7216) And let's see if it is copied or not.

- [02:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=7222) And let's see.

- [02:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=7224) Yeah, yeah, very nice.

- [02:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=7229) By the way, this no window is not working.

- [02:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=7238) Wow, it is just too fast.

- [02:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=7247) So here's great no window didn't work window style.

- [02:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=7253) What style there are hidden.

- [02:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=7255) Oh yeah, I will use hidden.

- [02:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=7259) Let's return back to our original path.

- [02:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=7264) Like this.

- [02:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=7267) Okay, wow, I don't even see the window right now.

- [02:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=7274) Hidden window is nice.

- [02:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=7275) And now I am able to even utilize weather.

- [02:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=7279) You see my Kaspersky is also taking a lot of CPU.

- [02:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=7284) But you see with no window, I'm able to utilize much more of my CPU.

- [02:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=7294) And I have converted images as well.

- [02:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=7297) Okay, now I will extract it again.

- [02:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=7303) Let's just delete all converted images.

- [02:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=7307) And let's delete animated images as well.

- [02:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=7312) And from download I will delete this too.

- [02:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=7338) And okay, delete that too.

- [02:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=7340) So let's extract here.

- [02:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=7345) Okay, pretty much our software is ready.

- [02:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=7352) I think it will work without any error right now. .gpx.png.gif We have switch.png.gpx.gif

- [02:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=7360) And we are having to lower method as well.

- [02:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=7367) By the way, I need to use lower with new system culture info.

- [02:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=7378) And us.

- [02:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=7381) Okay.

- [02:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=7384) So first let's test this.

- [02:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=7389) Oh, I also need to change this because now it is inside a single folder.

- [02:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=7399) Probably.

- [02:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=7402) Yeah.

- [02:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=7404) And let's test.

- [02:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=7408) Okay, so it is working.

- [02:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=7414) Now I will start without debugging to even optimize faster.

- [02:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=7420) Okay, and now we can watch our converted images with inside correct folders.

- [02:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=7432) Then we can compare folder sizes to see our gain.

- [02:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=7438) We can also see the process like this.

- [02:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=7449) Let's see how much CPU we have.

- [02:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=7451) We are pretty much utilizing all of my CPU and vpf application.

- [02:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=7459) Yeah, now the processes are being also shown inside vpf application since it is starting

- [02:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=7467) them.

- [02:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=7468) You see cweb, main window, command line, console window.

- [02:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=7475) Okay, five icons are done.

- [02:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=7480) Let's see how much bytes it is.

- [02:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=7483) So it is 988 kilobytes.

- [02:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=7487) Let's check the original size.

- [02:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=7492) It is 1063 bytes to be exact.

- [02:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=7502) So let's compare them.

- [02:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=7506) Minus.

- [02:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=7508) Okay.

- [02:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=7509) Actually, let's try it.

- [02:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=7517) Find out our data saving with keeping same quality.

- [02:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=7523) By the way, for PNG, we are using lossless.

- [02:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=7527) Wow, it is almost 40% probably.

- [02:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=7533) Okay, so this should work.

- [02:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=7542) It didn't work.

- [02:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=7544) Why?

- [02:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=7546) Oh, okay.

- [02:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=7548) 36%, we have got 36% bandwidth save with this approach.

- [02:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=7558) For example, this is also done.

- [02:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=7563) And when you use parallel for each, it doesn't follow the exact order of items inside that

- [02:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=7575) list.

- [02:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=7576) So it will get updated.

- [02:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=7580) I mean, it's order will be different.

- [02:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=7584) Okay, now this can work until morning because it will take a lot of time.

- [02:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=7590) I'm going to end the video here.

- [02:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=7593) I hope that you have enjoyed.

- [02:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=7599) So this application will solve my problem currently.

- [02:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=7604) So far, I have failed to find a solution to programmatically convert APNG into WebP.

- [02:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=7619) So I will use this website to convert them because this website is working.

- [02:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=7628) Yeah, to manually convert, but I am looking for answers.

- [02:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=7632) For example, I have asked it in MagicNet GitHub.

- [02:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=7642) Here, they have a discussion forum here.

- [02:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=7650) You see, I have asked this, but no answers yet.

- [02:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=7658) I'm looking for a solution.

- [02:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=7662) Actually, the Google is even Google is not supporting that.

- [02:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=7667) So you see we are using currently we are using C Web.

- [02:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=7677) However, C Web is also not supporting APNG.

- [02:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=7685) I have asked it in their forum as well.

- [02:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=7691) Which is that you find here map mailing list.

- [02:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=7699) I have asked how to convert animated.

- [02:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=7706) So still no easy solution.

- [02:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=7713) Since I don't have that many APNG, I plan to convert them.

- [02:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=7718) With this website, but probably it supports here it supports on a single image at a time.

- [02:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=7728) It may take some time for me to fix it.

- [02:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=7736) So I need a programmatic way.

- [02:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=7739) The command says that I can extract them with APNG this, but I will check it.

- [02:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=7753) OK, end of the video.

- [02:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=7756) I hope you have enjoyed.

- [02:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=7758) See you later.

- [02:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=7760) You can also ask me any questions through our Discord channel.

- [02:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nKwisL8dTs&t=7764) I will post my Discord channel link in the description of the video.
