- [00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=3) greetings everyone in this video I will show you the very best image to text

- [00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=6) show you the very best image to text image captioning models that I have

- [00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=9) image captioning models that I have collected and made one click installer

- [00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=13) collected and made one click installer you see this is the output of this image

- [00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=16) you see this is the output of this image and this can be used during training or

- [00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=20) and this can be used during training or get a prompt to generate similar images

- [00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=24) get a prompt to generate similar images with stable diffusion XL sdxl why

- [00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=28) with stable diffusion XL sdxl why because we are using with big

- [00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=31) because we are using with big G14 which is the clip vision of stable

- [00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=35) G14 which is the clip vision of stable diffusion XL sdxl this is from its

- [00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=38) diffusion XL sdxl this is from its official paper you see these are the

- [00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=41) official paper you see these are the text encoders used with sdxl and what

- [00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=44) text encoders used with sdxl and what does this do this means that this clip

- [00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=47) does this do this means that this clip Vision with caption model blip 2 is

- [00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=51) Vision with caption model blip 2 is generating a caption for us that is most

- [00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=55) generating a caption for us that is most likely to generate this image so how do

- [00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=59) likely to generate this image so how do I know I have tested this you see my

- [00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=62) I know I have tested this you see my stxl is open with automatic webui and

- [00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=65) stxl is open with automatic webui and let's look at the images that it has

- [00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=67) let's look at the images that it has generated with the same prompt no

- [00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=70) generated with the same prompt no negatives you see very similar style

- [00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=73) negatives you see very similar style excellent quality sometimes of course

- [00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=76) excellent quality sometimes of course not that very good but sometimes it is

- [00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=78) not that very good but sometimes it is superb and this way you can generate

- [00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=82) superb and this way you can generate very similar images or at the very

- [00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=85) very similar images or at the very least get idea by the way you see error

- [00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=88) least get idea by the way you see error connection out because I closed the

- [00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=90) connection out because I closed the command line window and I just used that

- [00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=94) command line window and I just used that prompt and I didn't even use

- [00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=97) prompt and I didn't even use negatives and here another one it is so

- [00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=100) negatives and here another one it is so strong so powerful that it is able to

- [00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=103) strong so powerful that it is able to even add to the prompt this caption

- [00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=106) even add to the prompt this caption images let's read it a man holding a

- [00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=109) images let's read it a man holding a sign that says caption images you see

- [00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=112) sign that says caption images you see the power of this model sci-fi character

- [00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=115) the power of this model sci-fi character render epic game portrait professional

- [00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=117) render epic game portrait professional capture trending on CG talk and other

- [00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=121) capture trending on CG talk and other tokens that it likes they are likely to

- [00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=125) tokens that it likes they are likely to generate this image but not all this I

- [00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=128) generate this image but not all this I also have other state-ofthe-art

- [00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=132) also have other state-ofthe-art image captioning models in these scripts

- [00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=135) image captioning models in these scripts I will show all of them I have modified

- [00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=138) I will show all of them I have modified this clip interrogator from a public

- [00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=142) this clip interrogator from a public repository what are the advantages of

- [00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=145) repository what are the advantages of my modification now it supports bch

- [00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=149) my modification now it supports bch processing you give the folder pad and

- [00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=152) processing you give the folder pad and then it will generate captions for all

- [00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=155) then it will generate captions for all of the images that is compatible with

- [00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=173) the visual clip models as you are seeing right now so many of them some of them

- [00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=174) right now so many of them some of them are using very lesser amount of vram so

- [00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=178) are using very lesser amount of vram so according to your G CPU you can test

- [00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=180) according to your G CPU you can test them it also supports five capturing

- [00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=183) them it also supports five capturing model this one is huge so if you don't

- [00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=186) model this one is huge so if you don't have a huge vrm I don't suggest that and

- [00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=195) large BP Base According to your GPU I am running this on RTX 390 24 GB vram and

- [00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=200) running this on RTX 390 24 GB vram and and it is working amazing but don't you

- [00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=203) and it is working amazing but don't you worry I have also prepared a rod

- [00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=207) worry I have also prepared a rod installer so you can use all of these

- [00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=211) installer so you can use all of these scripts on Rod as well or on kegle on

- [00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=215) scripts on Rod as well or on kegle on Google collab if you have and I will

- [00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=238) future it is in the research right now and the resolutions I Shar it here

- [00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=242) now and the resolutions I Shar it here you can use them to generate your images

- [00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=244) you can use them to generate your images after you get

- [00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=246) after you get your prompt ideas okay let's begin so

- [00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=249) your prompt ideas okay let's begin so how to use these scripts first of all

- [00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=252) how to use these scripts first of all you need to have python installed if you

- [00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=255) you need to have python installed if you don't know how to install python I have

- [00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=257) don't know how to install python I have the link here the video so when I type

- [00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=261) the link here the video so when I type python you will see that I am using

- [00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=264) python you will see that I am using 3.10.1 using 3.10 is mandatory don't use

- [00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=268) 3.10.1 using 3.10 is mandatory don't use other ones it can be 6 9 11 it doesn't

- [00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=271) other ones it can be 6 9 11 it doesn't matter my script installed everything

- [00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=274) matter my script installed everything into a virtual environment therefore it

- [00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=276) into a virtual environment therefore it will not affect your other installation

- [00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=280) will not affect your other installation such as automatic web UI or other ones

- [00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=282) such as automatic web UI or other ones confy UI or whatever you are

- [00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=285) confy UI or whatever you are using all of the individual files are

- [00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=293) use all files.zip file it includes everything much easier to use so let's

- [00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=296) everything much easier to use so let's get it from here let's go to our drive

- [00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=301) get it from here let's go to our drive and let's make a new like video test to

- [00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=306) and let's make a new like video test to okay this is my folder I copy paste the

- [00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=310) okay this is my folder I copy paste the file here extract here and all of the

- [00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=313) file here extract here and all of the files are here all you need to do is

- [00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=316) files are here all you need to do is double click install dobot file it will

- [00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=319) double click install dobot file it will ask you permission to install when you

- [00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=321) ask you permission to install when you run it first time then it will generate

- [00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=323) run it first time then it will generate a virtual environment here and install

- [00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=325) a virtual environment here and install all of the necessary libraries to run

- [00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=328) all of the necessary libraries to run this grad app

- [00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=329) this grad app and moreover to run this believe to

- [00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=334) and moreover to run this believe to version B to FL B to opt and moreover

- [00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=338) version B to FL B to opt and moreover one more thing which is Coco with large

- [00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=342) one more thing which is Coco with large so you will be able to use all of these

- [00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=345) so you will be able to use all of these image captioning models plus all of

- [00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=347) image captioning models plus all of these clip Vision models combination

- [00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=350) these clip Vision models combination with captioning

- [00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=352) with captioning models the installation is pretty fast

- [00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=355) models the installation is pretty fast if you have a fast internet

- [00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=357) if you have a fast internet connection so the inst solution has been

- [00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=360) connection so the inst solution has been completed you will get a printed message

- [00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=362) completed you will get a printed message like this let's close it let's return

- [00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=366) like this let's close it let's return back to our folder now we have a virtual

- [00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=368) back to our folder now we have a virtual environment and we are ready to use all

- [00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=370) environment and we are ready to use all of the files first I will show you the

- [00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=374) of the files first I will show you the gradio application there are two

- [00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=376) gradio application there are two versions run clip integrator run clip

- [00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=381) versions run clip integrator run clip interrogator yes this is going to use

- [00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=384) interrogator yes this is going to use about 19 GB vram and there is low vram

- [00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=388) about 19 GB vram and there is low vram version it is using about 14 GB I think

- [00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=391) version it is using about 14 GB I think with the best one with if you use the

- [00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=394) with the best one with if you use the smaller modules it is not so currently

- [00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=396) smaller modules it is not so currently 2.3 gab in use let's start the regular

- [00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=401) 2.3 gab in use let's start the regular version it will activate the virtual

- [00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=403) version it will activate the virtual environment and run the clip

- [00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=405) environment and run the clip interrogator dopy file so it is

- [00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=408) interrogator dopy file so it is beginning by default with loading model

- [00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=411) beginning by default with loading model blip large and also it is going to load

- [00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=414) blip large and also it is going to load with large 14 these model files will be

- [00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=418) with large 14 these model files will be downloaded in into your users cache it

- [00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=421) downloaded in into your users cache it can be Chang it actually so by default

- [00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=424) can be Chang it actually so by default they will be inside users let me show

- [00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=427) they will be inside users let me show you my username cach and inside hugging

- [00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=431) you my username cach and inside hugging face inside Hub you see all of the

- [00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=434) face inside Hub you see all of the models I tested are downloaded

- [00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=436) models I tested are downloaded here on Unix with this command we are

- [00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=441) here on Unix with this command we are able to change where the cach folder to

- [00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=444) able to change where the cach folder to be I didn't test this on Windows yet but

- [00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=448) be I didn't test this on Windows yet but it may work

- [00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=449) it may work possibly so you can run this on a

- [00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=451) possibly so you can run this on a command line interface with starting a

- [00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=453) command line interface with starting a new command line perhaps run as

- [00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=456) new command line perhaps run as administrator but this is working on

- [00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=458) administrator but this is working on Unix I didn't test on Windows

- [00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=461) Unix I didn't test on Windows yet so the URL will be running by

- [00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=465) yet so the URL will be running by default this one let's open it here so

- [00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=470) default this one let's open it here so it is started you can select any clip

- [00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=472) it is started you can select any clip model or any caption model and according

- [00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=475) model or any caption model and according to your selection the vram usage will

- [00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=477) to your selection the vram usage will change so we are now using 4 .4 GB by

- [00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=480) change so we are now using 4 .4 GB by the way when you change these models

- [00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=483) the way when you change these models there was they uh the application were

- [00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=486) there was they uh the application were not deloading the models therefore I

- [00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=489) not deloading the models therefore I have also fixed that so whenever you

- [00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=492) have also fixed that so whenever you make a change it will also deload model

- [00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=495) make a change it will also deload model so let's try this image generate prompt

- [00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=497) so let's try this image generate prompt for a single image this will use this

- [00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=500) for a single image this will use this model and this caption model for now and

- [00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=504) model and this caption model for now and let's see the vram usage it is now 11.5

- [00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=508) let's see the vram usage it is now 11.5 GB

- [00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=514) you can also run the low vram version it is a little bit lesser quality but it

- [00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=516) is a little bit lesser quality but it uses much lesser vrm and this was fast a

- [00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=521) uses much lesser vrm and this was fast a closeup dragon with a fire on its back

- [00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=524) closeup dragon with a fire on its back and the other proms of course the best

- [00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=526) and the other proms of course the best one among these are the with big G14 and

- [00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=531) one among these are the with big G14 and bleep 2 but for now let's refresh and

- [00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=536) bleep 2 but for now let's refresh and let's let me show you folder

- [00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=539) let's let me show you folder uh generating captions so let's select

- [00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=542) uh generating captions so let's select some of the images from my hopefully

- [00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=545) some of the images from my hopefully upcoming sdxl dreo tutorial some

- [00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=548) upcoming sdxl dreo tutorial some showcase images from here for example

- [00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=551) showcase images from here for example this one then let's

- [00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=554) this one then let's pick okay okay which one maybe let's

- [00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=558) pick okay okay which one maybe let's pick this one yes interesting one this

- [00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=561) pick this one yes interesting one this one and also let's pick this one okay so

- [00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=564) one and also let's pick this one okay so I will make a test case to show you

- [00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=567) I will make a test case to show you let's say caption

- [00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=571) let's say caption one okay let's copy paste them here copy

- [00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=574) one okay let's copy paste them here copy the pad of the folder like this paste it

- [00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=577) the pad of the folder like this paste it here and then all you need to do is bch

- [00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=580) here and then all you need to do is bch process for folder it will start bch

- [00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=590) processing and then as it process each image you will get the caption here see

- [00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=594) image you will get the caption here see I have selected a first model so I can

- [00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=597) I have selected a first model so I can show you quickly in the video video but

- [00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=599) show you quickly in the video video but you can try other models other caption

- [00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=602) you can try other models other caption models let's look at the caption okay so

- [00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=605) models let's look at the caption okay so this is the caption uh aate image of a

- [00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=608) this is the caption uh aate image of a man with glasses okay let's open the

- [00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=611) man with glasses okay let's open the image so we can see both

- [00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=614) image so we can see both together so this is the image and this

- [00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=617) together so this is the image and this is the caption it

- [00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=620) is the caption it generated I think it is looking pretty

- [00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=624) generated I think it is looking pretty accurate comic style viid colorful

- [00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=626) accurate comic style viid colorful inside page of a comic book scientific

- [00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=630) inside page of a comic book scientific Earth crust karach Skyline background

- [00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=633) Earth crust karach Skyline background portrait of band steer wow interesting

- [00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=635) portrait of band steer wow interesting so it thinks that I am similar to band

- [00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=638) so it thinks that I am similar to band Stiller in this image in Africa

- [00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=641) Stiller in this image in Africa character profile art Christian Oro

- [00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=643) character profile art Christian Oro unmistakenly Canyon interesting okay so

- [00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=647) unmistakenly Canyon interesting okay so these are the captions and it works this

- [00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=649) these are the captions and it works this is how the clip integrator app work for

- [00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=652) is how the clip integrator app work for example I didn't test let's see with

- [00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=657) example I didn't test let's see with B16 and let's just generate bch process

- [00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=661) B16 and let's just generate bch process now it will download the model first so

- [00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=664) now it will download the model first so you see loading caption model B LGE why

- [00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=667) you see loading caption model B LGE why is loading the model again because since

- [00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=670) is loading the model again because since the clip interrogator that the developer

- [00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=674) the clip interrogator that the developer code do not have a Del Lo model I made

- [00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=678) code do not have a Del Lo model I made an another approach therefore each time

- [00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=682) an another approach therefore each time whenever you make a change we reload

- [00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=685) whenever you make a change we reload both of them okay I think this was a

- [00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=688) both of them okay I think this was a very small file so it's already

- [00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=691) very small file so it's already downloaded and started processing

- [00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=694) downloaded and started processing yeah but you will see how it is

- [00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=696) yeah but you will see how it is downloading I will also show on a rod

- [00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=699) downloading I will also show on a rod there you will see okay let's close this

- [00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=701) there you will see okay let's close this so how to use the other scripts they are

- [00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=703) so how to use the other scripts they are also super

- [00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=706) also super easy so let's copy this as caption two

- [00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=710) easy so let's copy this as caption two okay and let's copy the pet of it and

- [00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=715) okay and let's copy the pet of it and let's say I want to

- [00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=717) let's say I want to use

- [00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=725) the which one half pris 17 gigabyte yes let's open this file all you need to do

- [00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=729) let's open this file all you need to do is edit

- [00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=731) is edit the pad of the text file like this okay

- [00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=737) the pad of the text file like this okay then let's run it how we are running it

- [00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=740) then let's run it how we are running it we double click this one it will start

- [00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=744) we double click this one it will start processing you see it is supporting all

- [00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=747) processing you see it is supporting all three options let's go with the first

- [00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=749) three options let's go with the first one let's look at the vram usage first

- [00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=751) one let's look at the vram usage first it will load it also has 8bit loading

- [00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=755) it will load it also has 8bit loading feature which reduces vram usage

- [00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=758) feature which reduces vram usage significantly so if you don't have a

- [00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=761) significantly so if you don't have a good GPU you can use 8bit and it is also

- [00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=764) good GPU you can use 8bit and it is also working really

- [00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=766) working really good so this is going to caption all of

- [00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=769) good so this is going to caption all of the images

- [00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=772) the images with using B to opt

- [00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=776) with using B to opt 6.7 billion parameters model so you see

- [00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=779) 6.7 billion parameters model so you see the vram usage is increasing the speed

- [00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=782) the vram usage is increasing the speed is also amazing all of them are caption

- [00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=784) is also amazing all of them are caption it so let's look at this one so this is

- [00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=787) it so let's look at this one so this is much simpler than the clip Vision models

- [00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=790) much simpler than the clip Vision models a man with glasses and a bird and a bir

- [00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=793) a man with glasses and a bird and a bir standing in front of a city so this is

- [00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=796) standing in front of a city so this is the caption of this image this way you

- [00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=800) the caption of this image this way you can use all these models there is one

- [00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=803) can use all these models there is one more model for example which is Coca

- [00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=807) more model for example which is Coca with large let's open also change its

- [00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=810) with large let's open also change its video pad like this and let's start its

- [00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=815) video pad like this and let's start its captioning as well this uses even lesser

- [00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=818) captioning as well this uses even lesser vram it is using about 5 GB vram I have

- [00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=821) vram it is using about 5 GB vram I have tested all of them and it is also pretty

- [00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=824) tested all of them and it is also pretty fast and it is done so let's look at the

- [00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=827) fast and it is done so let's look at the caption again reload so this is a

- [00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=830) caption again reload so this is a driving of a man with glasses in front

- [00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=832) driving of a man with glasses in front of a

- [00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=833) of a CD so this is how you use all of the

- [00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=836) CD so this is how you use all of the models with one click install how about

- [00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=839) models with one click install how about use them on RAM

- [00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=841) use them on RAM pod for using on ramp pod I suggest you

- [00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=845) pod for using on ramp pod I suggest you to use Rod pest stable diffusion

- [00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=848) to use Rod pest stable diffusion template let's go to our Rod let's log

- [00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=852) template let's go to our Rod let's log in okay let's Select Community Cloud

- [00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=857) in okay let's Select Community Cloud select the first one extreme speed you

- [00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=860) select the first one extreme speed you can use RTX 390 a 5,000 maybe even a a

- [00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=865) can use RTX 390 a 5,000 maybe even a a 4,500 I will go with RTX 39

- [00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=869) 4,500 I will go with RTX 39 and in here select first uh let's select

- [00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=873) and in here select first uh let's select fast table diffusion type fast fast

- [00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=875) fast table diffusion type fast fast table diffusion customize deployment

- [00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=877) table diffusion customize deployment some of the models are really really big

- [00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=879) some of the models are really really big so you can make this volume dis 100 even

- [00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=882) so you can make this volume dis 100 even more and if you want to connect with

- [00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=886) more and if you want to connect with proxy rather than the sharing at here

- [00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=895) 7861 because by default it is running on 7860 Port so by opening this Port we

- [00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=899) 7860 Port so by opening this Port we will be able to connect set override

- [00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=902) will be able to connect set override continue deploy my ports it should start

- [00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=906) continue deploy my ports it should start pretty

- [00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=907) pretty fast So the instructions are written

- [00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=910) fast So the instructions are written here but I will also show you how to use

- [00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=914) here but I will also show you how to use them okay it should start pretty fast

- [00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=917) them okay it should start pretty fast these are our po

- [00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=919) these are our po speeds OKAY model started let's connect

- [00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=923) speeds OKAY model started let's connect to the Jupiter

- [00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=935) all right all you need to do is upload the files that you are going to use so

- [00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=938) the files that you are going to use so we are going to use let's make several

- [00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=940) we are going to use let's make several test clip interrogator maybe let's

- [00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=943) test clip interrogator maybe let's upload all of them because they are not

- [00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=945) upload all of them because they are not much okay open they will get all

- [00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=947) much okay open they will get all uploaded open a new terminal now the

- [00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=951) uploaded open a new terminal now the instructions are very clear first of all

- [00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=955) instructions are very clear first of all actually

- [00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=956) actually just uh let's say you can delete the

- [00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=960) just uh let's say you can delete the auto models folder because they are

- [00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=962) auto models folder because they are going to take your existing container

- [00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=964) going to take your existing container space so let's first delete them if

- [00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=966) space so let's first delete them if you're not going to use stable diffusion

- [00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=969) you're not going to use stable diffusion XL then let's copy all of these commands

- [00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=973) XL then let's copy all of these commands like this copy paste them and just

- [00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=977) like this copy paste them and just patiently wait it will generate a new

- [00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=979) patiently wait it will generate a new virtual environment folder it will

- [00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=981) virtual environment folder it will install all of the necessary libraries

- [00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=984) install all of the necessary libraries into this

- [00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=986) into this folder okay the installation has been

- [00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=988) folder okay the installation has been completed how do you know it will print

- [00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=992) completed how do you know it will print your virtual environment made and ready

- [00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=994) your virtual environment made and ready to use so open a new terminal always

- [00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=998) to use so open a new terminal always follow the commands here first of all

- [00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1001) follow the commands here first of all for whatever the script that you are

- [00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1004) for whatever the script that you are going to use you need to execute these

- [00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1007) going to use you need to execute these two okay so let's execute them so now

- [00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1011) two okay so let's execute them so now virtual envirment is activated and we

- [00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1014) virtual envirment is activated and we are in the workspace directory let's

- [00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1018) are in the workspace directory let's start with clip interrogator we are not

- [00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1021) start with clip interrogator we are not going to use share or you can also use

- [00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1023) going to use share or you can also use if you wish and let's start

- [00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1032) it we will see GPU memory user increase but first it will download the necessary

- [00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1035) but first it will download the necessary model you see now we have Hub here

- [00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1038) model you see now we have Hub here because we did set the cach folder for

- [00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1042) because we did set the cach folder for hugging face the workspace folder with

- [00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1044) hugging face the workspace folder with this command this is really really

- [00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1047) this command this is really really important okay it is getting

- [00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1058) downloaded it is downloading the clip with large 14

- [00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1061) with large 14 model okay everything downloaded and

- [00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1064) model okay everything downloaded and started you can't connect this URL so

- [00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1067) started you can't connect this URL so how we are going to connect connect with

- [00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1071) how we are going to connect connect with 7861 Port which we said in the

- [00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1074) 7861 Port which we said in the beginning okay now our interrogator is

- [00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1078) beginning okay now our interrogator is open let's load an image let's load for

- [00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1083) open let's load an image let's load for example this one let's generate Pro for

- [00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1086) example this one let's generate Pro for a single

- [00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1088) a single image okay we got a connection errored

- [00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1092) image okay we got a connection errored out

- [00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1094) out interesting let's try

- [00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1108) error let me see if this is the correct cor

- [00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1109) cor [Music]

- [00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1118) file [Music]

- [00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1120) [Music] okay maybe let's try with the share

- [00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1136) one okay sometimes connection may give error but this is

- [00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1139) error but this is not

- [00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1147) accurate all right one second let me see the result so I will restart

- [00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1156) p this is interesting on Windows it is working

- [00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1159) interesting on Windows it is working perfect but

- [00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1162) perfect but on rumod sometimes we are getting this

- [00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1166) on rumod sometimes we are getting this error still I don't know what why sadly

- [00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1170) error still I don't know what why sadly I couldn't solve the problem directly at

- [00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1173) I couldn't solve the problem directly at least it turns out that there is a bug I

- [00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1176) least it turns out that there is a bug I have updated the thread also do not use

- [00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1180) have updated the thread also do not use the

- [00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1181) the 7861 Port currently it is not working so

- [00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1185) 7861 Port currently it is not working so we are going to use share option and

- [00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1187) we are going to use share option and when we use share option we are getting

- [00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1190) when we use share option we are getting a running on public URL like this and it

- [00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1192) a running on public URL like this and it is working why this is mandatory

- [00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1196) is working why this is mandatory because since some of the processing

- [00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1198) because since some of the processing will take over 1 minute we have to use Q

- [00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1202) will take over 1 minute we have to use Q option of the gradio and when Q option

- [00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1205) option of the gradio and when Q option of the gradio is using it is not working

- [00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1208) of the gradio is using it is not working because of this error I also opened an

- [00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1212) because of this error I also opened an issue thread on the GitHub of the grad

- [00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1215) issue thread on the GitHub of the grad app I hope they will fix it I also addit

- [00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1218) app I hope they will fix it I also addit the link here so on Rod you are Al you

- [00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1221) the link here so on Rod you are Al you you need to use gradual leave with share

- [00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1224) you need to use gradual leave with share option do not forget that to running it

- [00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1228) option do not forget that to running it copy entirely with share option and it

- [00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1230) copy entirely with share option and it will start with share link and now it is

- [00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1233) will start with share link and now it is working as you are seeing right now so

- [00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1237) working as you are seeing right now so let me demonstrate another one this is

- [00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1238) let me demonstrate another one this is running on Rod let's generate a

- [00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1243) running on Rod let's generate a prompt let's see the speed currently not

- [00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1246) prompt let's see the speed currently not the best model is selected but it is

- [00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1247) the best model is selected but it is pretty fast and when you first time run

- [00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1250) pretty fast and when you first time run it it will take longer than the second

- [00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1252) it it will take longer than the second time of course because it is going to do

- [00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1254) time of course because it is going to do some caching and

- [00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1256) some caching and more and we are getting the result yes

- [00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1259) more and we are getting the result yes it is here so let's say you want to use

- [00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1262) it is here so let's say you want to use the best model on rumod so select this

- [00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1264) the best model on rumod so select this and also select this generate prompt

- [00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1267) and also select this generate prompt when you first time run it it will

- [00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1269) when you first time run it it will download all of the models into Hub

- [00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1272) download all of the models into Hub folder you see they are all here when I

- [00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1276) folder you see they are all here when I enter inside it we can see all of the

- [00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1279) enter inside it we can see all of the cloned files it is huge actually so when

- [00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1283) cloned files it is huge actually so when you first time run it it will download

- [00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1285) you first time run it it will download them but later they will be kept here

- [00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1288) them but later they will be kept here here and currently we are using about

- [00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1291) here and currently we are using about 34% of our volume

- [00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1295) 34% of our volume disk so it is now loading the model into

- [00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1298) disk so it is now loading the model into the vram loading caption model you

- [00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1301) the vram loading caption model you see so it has worked and generated the

- [00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1306) see so it has worked and generated the caption let's say you want to generate

- [00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1310) caption let's say you want to generate captions of a folder you can upload

- [00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1313) captions of a folder you can upload folder by using upload files or even B

- [00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1318) folder by using upload files or even B either way is using Rod CTL if you don't

- [00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1321) either way is using Rod CTL if you don't know how to use Rod CTL watch this

- [00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1323) know how to use Rod CTL watch this tutorial video this is a master tutorial

- [00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1327) tutorial video this is a master tutorial video I made for rumod it is over 100

- [00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1330) video I made for rumod it is over 100 minutes it's a public tutorial okay so

- [00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1334) minutes it's a public tutorial okay so which folder should we generate

- [00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1337) which folder should we generate captions I am going to generate captions

- [00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1340) captions I am going to generate captions for my dream boot tutorial showcase so

- [00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1345) for my dream boot tutorial showcase so let's send this folder into to the rod I

- [00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1348) let's send this folder into to the rod I will start a CMD here rumod CTL send the

- [00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1354) will start a CMD here rumod CTL send the folder name I need to put this since it

- [00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1356) folder name I need to put this since it has a space okay and I will use this

- [00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1360) has a space okay and I will use this command to upload them into the

- [00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1363) command to upload them into the workspace let's hit they will get

- [00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1366) workspace let's hit they will get uploaded into the rod you see it is

- [00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1371) uploaded into the rod you see it is normally 270

- [00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1374) normally 270 megabytes and they will get

- [00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1376) megabytes and they will get uploaded much faster this

- [00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1381) uploaded much faster this way okay files are uploaded let's

- [00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1384) way okay files are uploaded let's refresh the folder

- [00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1387) refresh the folder content let's see where they

- [00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1390) content let's see where they are oh it uploaded all of them into the

- [00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1394) are oh it uploaded all of them into the main root folder so we should have made

- [00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1397) main root folder so we should have made a folder then run the command what I

- [00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1400) a folder then run the command what I mean is make a new folder let's say

- [00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1403) mean is make a new folder let's say caption

- [00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1404) caption one enter inside it start new

- [00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1409) one enter inside it start new terminal then let's run the command one

- [00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1411) terminal then let's run the command one more time so that I can show you and run

- [00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1415) more time so that I can show you and run this command like this this way they

- [00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1418) this command like this this way they will get uploaded into this caption one

- [00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1420) will get uploaded into this caption one folder so do not make the mistake I

- [00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1424) folder so do not make the mistake I made okay they're uploaded and images

- [00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1427) made okay they're uploaded and images are

- [00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1429) are extracted however the their naming is

- [00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1431) extracted however the their naming is change it yes this is not good for us so

- [00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1435) change it yes this is not good for us so what would be the B approach let me

- [00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1439) what would be the B approach let me think about

- [00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1441) think about it okay let's ask C gb2 for a quick code

- [00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1445) it okay let's ask C gb2 for a quick code give me a Unix command that will

- [00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1449) give me a Unix command that will take a folder pad and rename all files

- [00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1454) take a folder pad and rename all files and

- [00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1455) and remove which file name this one let's

- [00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1465) see from the file name itself okay so you can always use use T

- [00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1469) okay so you can always use use T GPT and this is the prompt let's open a

- [00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1474) GPT and this is the prompt let's open a new terminal before copy pasting it

- [00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1477) new terminal before copy pasting it let's see okay it says this okay folder

- [00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1480) let's see okay it says this okay folder pad so the folder pad is copy pad you

- [00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1484) pad so the folder pad is copy pad you can always use chat GPT therefore I'm

- [00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1488) can always use chat GPT therefore I'm going to show you it is free you know so

- [00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1491) going to show you it is free you know so the folder pet will do this copy

- [00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1494) the folder pet will do this copy this and yes let's see

- [00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1499) this and yes let's see okay it looks like it didn't work so we

- [00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1501) okay it looks like it didn't work so we must

- [00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1503) must have error

- [00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1505) have error somewhere it says

- [00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1524) accurate let see the [Music]

- [00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1526) [Music] commands

- [00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1553) folder okay now let's do copy start a new terminal because it

- [00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1556) copy start a new terminal because it didn't work let's let's try like

- [00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1560) didn't work let's let's try like this wow it doesn't work

- [00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1563) this wow it doesn't work why but it is looking

- [00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1567) why but it is looking correct maybe we can

- [00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1569) correct maybe we can use another

- [00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1572) use another approach and notebook a python notebook

- [00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1576) approach and notebook a python notebook okay so then I will tell chat gbt to do

- [00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1580) okay so then I will tell chat gbt to do this which will work much

- [00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1583) this which will work much better okay let's say uh

- [00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1588) better okay let's say uh I will also use the free chat GPT give

- [00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1591) I will also use the free chat GPT give me a python command that will scan

- [00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1597) me a python command that will scan the current

- [00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1600) the current directory and

- [00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1603) directory and remove okay

- [00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1605) remove okay let's copy this part of the

- [00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1610) let's copy this part of the image it doesn't

- [00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1612) image it doesn't copy let's

- [00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1614) copy let's copy let's rename yes

- [00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1618) copy let's rename yes remove this

- [00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1620) remove this part remove from the file

- [00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1624) part remove from the file names

- [00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1626) names okay all right let's

- [00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1628) okay all right let's copy paste it here run and you see it is

- [00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1632) copy paste it here run and you see it is fixed yeah so I just show you how to fix

- [00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1637) fixed yeah so I just show you how to fix your problems by using chat GPT because

- [00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1640) your problems by using chat GPT because I like to teach how to catch a

- [00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1644) I like to teach how to catch a fish and now we are ready then let's go

- [00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1647) fish and now we are ready then let's go to here copy pet when working with rod

- [00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1652) to here copy pet when working with rod always we put a back slash to the

- [00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1654) always we put a back slash to the beginning and paste the pad then let's

- [00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1659) beginning and paste the pad then let's hit bch process

- [00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1661) hit bch process folder this is super slow so I won't

- [00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1664) folder this is super slow so I won't wait entirely but let's just see some of

- [00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1668) wait entirely but let's just see some of the captions are

- [00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1670) the captions are generated okay it is starting already to

- [00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1673) generated okay it is starting already to generate captions let's enter inside

- [00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1677) generate captions let's enter inside here let's sort by last modified you see

- [00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1680) here let's sort by last modified you see this is our notebook to rename

- [00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1689) them and the captions will start appearing in a

- [00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1696) moment okay okay we got two captions already

- [00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1700) okay okay we got two captions already generated let's look at them this is the

- [00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1703) generated let's look at them this is the image you see this one and this is the

- [00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1706) image you see this one and this is the caption and ding of a man with curly

- [00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1729) colors polarized lens purple vibrant beit smooth material and such so it is

- [00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1732) beit smooth material and such so it is working amazing now how to use other CPS

- [00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1737) working amazing now how to use other CPS normally we could kill this instance

- [00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1740) normally we could kill this instance with

- [00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1740) with fuser however fuser is not by default

- [00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1744) fuser however fuser is not by default installed so let's say how to install F

- [00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1748) installed so let's say how to install F user in Unix okay all we need to do is

- [00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1754) user in Unix okay all we need to do is running these two commands first yeah we

- [00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1757) running these two commands first yeah we need

- [00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1759) need to install this let's see by the way we

- [00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1762) to install this let's see by the way we need to first update

- [00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1765) need to first update up update is about something like this

- [00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1768) up update is about something like this let's

- [00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1770) let's say op update

- [00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1778) commands Okay it is this up update let's run

- [00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1787) it okay it is done then we will install this okay it is getting

- [00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1790) this okay it is getting installed waiting

- [00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1792) installed waiting headers yes it is done then

- [00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1795) headers yes it is done then fuser DK

- [00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1798) fuser DK 78 60 why we need this because we need

- [00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1802) 78 60 why we need this because we need to refresh the memory or you can restart

- [00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1806) to refresh the memory or you can restart the

- [00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1806) the poort then TCP it will kill the running

- [00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1810) poort then TCP it will kill the running instance of the gradio and our GPU

- [00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1813) instance of the gradio and our GPU memory will be refresh it should we

- [00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1817) memory will be refresh it should we refresh it let's

- [00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1820) refresh it let's see yes the up is

- [00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1824) see yes the up is De yes memory is now not being used it

- [00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1828) De yes memory is now not being used it okay now let's use the this actually I

- [00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1832) okay now let's use the this actually I will use the 8bit Precision with better

- [00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1835) will use the 8bit Precision with better one so which one so let's close all of

- [00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1838) one so which one so let's close all of these tops other other tops so I am

- [00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1842) these tops other other tops so I am going to use eight with pres 10 GB vram

- [00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1844) going to use eight with pres 10 GB vram file and this is our caption one let's

- [00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1847) file and this is our caption one let's copy as pad change the pet here and

- [00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1851) copy as pad change the pet here and don't forget the put back slash and we

- [00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1855) don't forget the put back slash and we are ready so how to run this one let's

- [00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1858) are ready so how to run this one let's go to terminal let's return back to our

- [00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1863) go to terminal let's return back to our Command first copy this run it now we

- [00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1866) Command first copy this run it now we are activated and all we need to do is

- [00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1869) are activated and all we need to do is now type

- [00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1871) now type Python and the file name is 8bit so I

- [00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1874) Python and the file name is 8bit so I type 8 hit Top then I end it with pi and

- [00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1880) type 8 hit Top then I end it with pi and hit enter and then it will ask me which

- [00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1883) hit enter and then it will ask me which model the best model one of the best

- [00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1885) model the best model one of the best model is believe to Fant t5x

- [00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1889) model is believe to Fant t5x XXL however this requires a lot of vram

- [00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1894) XXL however this requires a lot of vram and therefore on 24 GB you need to use

- [00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1897) and therefore on 24 GB you need to use 8bit Precision so let's select it first

- [00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1900) 8bit Precision so let's select it first it will download all of the models and

- [00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1903) it will download all of the models and it is huge probably

- [00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1907) it is huge probably our uh hard drive oh it should be I

- [00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1911) our uh hard drive oh it should be I think we have like 60 gab space so let's

- [00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1914) think we have like 60 gab space so let's just wait

- [00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1916) just wait it

- [00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1921) so the download has been completed and it started captioning the images the

- [00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1924) it started captioning the images the down took a lot of time let's enter

- [00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1928) down took a lot of time let's enter inside the captioning and let's look at

- [00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1930) inside the captioning and let's look at the captions for example this one it

- [00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1934) the captions for example this one it says that a man a figurine of a man

- [00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1938) says that a man a figurine of a man standing on a rock and yes amazing let's

- [00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1942) standing on a rock and yes amazing let's look at another one okay this image

- [00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1945) look at another one okay this image let's look at the caption a man in

- [00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1947) let's look at the caption a man in glasses and a tie standing in a dark

- [00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1950) glasses and a tie standing in a dark room pretty accurate let's look another

- [00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1954) room pretty accurate let's look another one for example this image let's look at

- [00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1956) one for example this image let's look at the caption a man in glasses standing in

- [00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1959) the caption a man in glasses standing in front of a city so it is up to you to

- [00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1962) front of a city so it is up to you to test different captioning right now I am

- [00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1965) test different captioning right now I am testing different captionings the speed

- [00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1967) testing different captionings the speed is really good and it is using

- [00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1971) is really good and it is using 75% of 24 gab vram when running in 8bit

- [00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1977) 75% of 24 gab vram when running in 8bit remember that so if you want to run it

- [00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1980) remember that so if you want to run it in full run it in half precis not 8bit

- [00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1984) in full run it in half precis not 8bit precis we are not running in full PR

- [00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1986) precis we are not running in full PR because full Position will use four

- [00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1989) because full Position will use four times of eight

- [00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1991) times of eight pris you can hire a machine that has

- [00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1994) pris you can hire a machine that has more vram and run them in higher

- [00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=1999) more vram and run them in higher precision and that's it so if you have

- [00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=2003) precision and that's it so if you have any pro any issues any questions later

- [00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=2007) any pro any issues any questions later let me know thank you so much for

- [00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNA9p94JmtY&t=2008) let me know thank you so much for supporting me see you later
