### Video Transcription


- [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzYnhKeaJBs&t=0) Greetings everyone. Today I am going to show&nbsp; you how to one-click install and run two ComfyUI&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzYnhKeaJBs&t=8) workflows. The first one is generating a picture&nbsp; of a clothing, any clothing, with a person so that&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzYnhKeaJBs&t=17) you can generate random persons with the specific&nbsp; clothings. The second one is turning an image into&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzYnhKeaJBs&t=26) a 3D figure. So, these two workflows are from this&nbsp; repository and making them one-click to install&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzYnhKeaJBs&t=34) and run was really, really hard. I have worked&nbsp; whole day to prepare for you, so that it will&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzYnhKeaJBs&t=41) be very easy for you to just install and run,&nbsp; and hopefully today I am going to show you how&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzYnhKeaJBs&t=48) to run these two workflows with such easiness. First of all, you need to install ComfyUI. If&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzYnhKeaJBs&t=53) you already have installed it, just download our&nbsp; zip file. The link will be in the description of&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzYnhKeaJBs&t=58) the video. Move the zip file into your ComfyUI&nbsp; installation folder or just watch this tutorial&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzYnhKeaJBs&t=66) and install it and learn it. After you move it,&nbsp; right-click and extract all into the same folder.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzYnhKeaJBs&t=73) Actually, it extracted into another folder,&nbsp; so the best way is WinRAR extract here. So&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzYnhKeaJBs&t=78) it will overwrite and update everything. Then&nbsp; Windows update comfyui.bat file, more info,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzYnhKeaJBs&t=85) run anyway. This will update your ComfyUI to the&nbsp; latest version. If you make a fresh installation,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzYnhKeaJBs&t=91) it will be already updated. Then you will see&nbsp; this workflows folder. Enter inside it and enter&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzYnhKeaJBs&t=97) inside Transfer Cloth and Turn into 3D. Then&nbsp; double-click install clothing and 3D.bat file,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzYnhKeaJBs&t=104) more info, run anyway. This will install&nbsp; necessary nodes and requirements. Yes,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzYnhKeaJBs&t=111) we've seen a red here. This is not important.&nbsp; It will work. Just wait for installation to&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzYnhKeaJBs&t=117) be completed and it is done and ready. This&nbsp; installed all the custom nodes and requirements.&nbsp;

- [00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzYnhKeaJBs&t=123) Then we need to download the necessary models.&nbsp; To download them, I will use our Swarm UI auto&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzYnhKeaJBs&t=128) installer and the ultimate model downloader. You&nbsp; see there is version 32 right now. Always use&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzYnhKeaJBs&t=134) the latest version. Then you can either install&nbsp; it as seen in this video or just move back into&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzYnhKeaJBs&t=141) your previous installation and then right-click,&nbsp; WinRAR, extract here and overwrite all the files.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzYnhKeaJBs&t=148) So this will update your application to the latest&nbsp; version. Then double-click Windows start download&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzYnhKeaJBs&t=154) models up.bat file, more info run anyway. It will&nbsp; update the requirements if there is any update&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzYnhKeaJBs&t=161) and it is started. So you see currently this is&nbsp; version 32. When you are watching this video,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzYnhKeaJBs&t=166) it can be even better. So how we are going to&nbsp; download the models? I have added new models&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzYnhKeaJBs&t=171) here. We can see that there is image generation&nbsp; models, Flux models, and for this tutorial, I will&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzYnhKeaJBs&t=178) download Flux Dev 1.0 GGUF Q8. You can also use&nbsp; the regular model, both of them works. Actually,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzYnhKeaJBs&t=185) I will also show that. So where we will download&nbsp; this? We need to download them inside ComfyUI,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzYnhKeaJBs&t=191) inside models folder. So copy your path&nbsp; of ComfyUI, paste it here. By default,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzYnhKeaJBs&t=196) this is made for Swarm UI, but this works&nbsp; fully with ComfyUI as well. And also check&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzYnhKeaJBs&t=202) this checkbox for ComfyUI. Then we can begin&nbsp; downloading. So first, click this Flux Dev&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzYnhKeaJBs&t=208) version 1 GGUF Q8. If you have a lower VRAM GPU,&nbsp; like 12 GB or even lower, you can also download&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzYnhKeaJBs&t=216) lower models. So it is up to you, like Q4 or Q5.&nbsp; The Q8 version is almost same quality as FP16,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzYnhKeaJBs&t=225) and this shows the quality comparison&nbsp; of the GGUF. This applies to all models,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzYnhKeaJBs&t=232) whether it is Flux or other video models. So Q8&nbsp; is better than Q6, better than Q5, better than&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzYnhKeaJBs&t=237) Q4. And also if there are letters, KM is better&nbsp; than KS, better than K, better than 1 and 0. Okay,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzYnhKeaJBs&t=244) let's click the this one. It will be added to the&nbsp; queue and it will be automatically downloaded.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzYnhKeaJBs&t=250) Since I already have it, it is skipped. Then at&nbsp; the very bottom, you will see there is ComfyUI&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzYnhKeaJBs&t=254) workflows bundles. The first bundle is Clothing&nbsp; Migration Workflow bundle. This will download&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzYnhKeaJBs&t=260) all of the necessary models for the these two&nbsp; workflows that I'm going to show. So it will start&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzYnhKeaJBs&t=267) downloading, and we can see that everything&nbsp; is already downloaded. Let's verify. Yes,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzYnhKeaJBs&t=273) so the queue is zero and everything is downloaded&nbsp; because I had downloaded them previously.&nbsp;

- [00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzYnhKeaJBs&t=278) Now I am ready to start using these workflows.&nbsp; So let's just start our ComfyUI with Windows run&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzYnhKeaJBs&t=284) GPU.bat file, more info, run anyway. By the way,&nbsp; you can open this .bat file with any text editor&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzYnhKeaJBs&t=291) and remove this use Sage attention. This is&nbsp; not mandatory, but this is speeding up with&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzYnhKeaJBs&t=297) a little bit tradeoff, quality decrease. So it&nbsp; is up to you. You can also add other parameters&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzYnhKeaJBs&t=304) to here. This is how the ComfyUI is getting their&nbsp; parameters. So our ComfyUI is starting. Just wait&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzYnhKeaJBs&t=310) for the start. Okay, the interface has started.&nbsp; So the workflows are inside workflows folder,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzYnhKeaJBs&t=316) and we have the workflows here. So let's begin&nbsp; with the clothing workflow. You can either drag&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzYnhKeaJBs&t=322) and drop this or the image itself, and&nbsp; this is the workflow. So first of all,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzYnhKeaJBs&t=327) you need to pick your clothing image. So I have&nbsp; these clothings, for example, let's pick this&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzYnhKeaJBs&t=333) one. Then what parameters you need to change? The&nbsp; most important parameter that you need to change&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzYnhKeaJBs&t=338) is prompt according to your generation. This will&nbsp; generate a new person by using the Flux Dev model.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzYnhKeaJBs&t=345) So we are not providing a person here. Then the&nbsp; other parameters that you can change is adding&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzYnhKeaJBs&t=351) some text here or here you can add. The text is&nbsp; coming from there, and there is also automatically&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzYnhKeaJBs&t=358) captioning. We will see the final text. You see&nbsp; there is also some extra prompts here. And this&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzYnhKeaJBs&t=362) part is very important. This changes according to&nbsp; your GPU. Currently, I am using Flux Dev GGUF Q8,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzYnhKeaJBs&t=369) but you can use other Flux Dev models as well.&nbsp; So if you are using a lower different GGUF,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzYnhKeaJBs&t=376) you need to select it from here. Moreover, we have&nbsp; even a block swapping feature for even more lower&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzYnhKeaJBs&t=382) VRAM. You see, we select our Flux Dev model. This&nbsp; is FP16 model, and you can set the block swapping,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzYnhKeaJBs&t=390) and this will use way lower VRAM. So all you&nbsp; need to do is just drag and drop this here. Let&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzYnhKeaJBs&t=396) me show you. Okay. I don't understand why this&nbsp; is like this. Maybe you can tell me later. But&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzYnhKeaJBs&t=401) let's make it like, yes. So now it will use this&nbsp; for generating the output. This will be slower,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzYnhKeaJBs&t=409) but this will use way lower VRAM than the other&nbsp; version. And this will be also maximum quality&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzYnhKeaJBs&t=415) because we are loading the model as an FP16&nbsp; weight. You can also load it as an FP8 for&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzYnhKeaJBs&t=421) speed up and also lower VRAM consumption. But if&nbsp; you want the maximum quality, then you need to use&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzYnhKeaJBs&t=427) this default or use GGUF Q8. I am explaining these&nbsp; in details because this doesn't change with other&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzYnhKeaJBs&t=435) models. This is the logic of loading models. Then&nbsp; everything else has been automatically downloaded&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzYnhKeaJBs&t=440) into our accurate folder. What other parameters&nbsp; that you can play is the CFG guider. This is&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzYnhKeaJBs&t=446) impacting the output. I find that 1.5 is good. 3.5&nbsp; were generating blurry images for me, so I made&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzYnhKeaJBs&t=454) it 1.5. There is also generation resolution.&nbsp; So the width and height of the image changes&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzYnhKeaJBs&t=462) according to the input clothing image. Yes, here.&nbsp; You see there is scale image to total pixels. So&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzYnhKeaJBs&t=469) you set the final output resolution from here.&nbsp; By default, it is 1 megapixel. So that is the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzYnhKeaJBs&t=476) best resolution for the Flux. And we are ready. We&nbsp; just run and let's see how it is running. I will&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzYnhKeaJBs&t=482) open my nvitop as usual. So nvitop, and we can&nbsp; monitor what is happening here. So first of all,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzYnhKeaJBs&t=489) it is going to load the Meta Llama. By the&nbsp; way, I made it by default an F4, so it is&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzYnhKeaJBs&t=496) 4-bit quantization. It uses a little bit amount&nbsp; of VRAM. You can also change this to BF16 if you&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzYnhKeaJBs&t=503) have a high VRAM GPU like 24 GB of GPU to get a&nbsp; better, you know, automatic captioning. We will&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzYnhKeaJBs&t=509) see the final used text here. So this will give&nbsp; you a lot of ideas of how it works. Photograph,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzYnhKeaJBs&t=516) [cloth-on]. This is specific to this model. You can&nbsp; read more information here about this model. It is&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzYnhKeaJBs&t=523) combination of several sub-models and other stuff.&nbsp; And we will see the final text here. As I said,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzYnhKeaJBs&t=529) the photograph [cloth-on], the image pair highlights&nbsp; a transformation from a clothing sample. Just&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzYnhKeaJBs&t=534) pause the video and read it. So this will be the&nbsp; final prompt. I am using T5XXL FP16. This can be&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzYnhKeaJBs&t=541) also changed with GGUF, but you can also make this&nbsp; as CPU because this is only used for encoding,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzYnhKeaJBs&t=548) then it is unloaded. So it is not kept in your&nbsp; VRAM. Therefore, it is not very important. We&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzYnhKeaJBs&t=554) are using some specific models, but these are&nbsp; all downloaded with our automatic downloader,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzYnhKeaJBs&t=559) so you don't spend time with them. You see there&nbsp; is migration Lora, there is Flux inpainting,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzYnhKeaJBs&t=564) a specific inpainting from Ali Mama. So&nbsp; yes, this is a very, very advanced workflow,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzYnhKeaJBs&t=570) and making this this much easier to install and&nbsp; use was a huge task, believe me. And we are going&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzYnhKeaJBs&t=577) to see the image in a moment here. Currently, it&nbsp; is using a lot of VRAM because I'm using Q8 GGUF,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzYnhKeaJBs&t=584) but as I said, if you use this, it is as low&nbsp; as like 8 or 10 GB of VRAM, not much. So you&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzYnhKeaJBs&t=591) can use this. You can make this as one, so&nbsp; it will use minimum amount of VRAM if you&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzYnhKeaJBs&t=596) don't have a powerful GPU. And we got the image.&nbsp; This is a really, really decent image. I mean,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzYnhKeaJBs&t=601) look at this. This is the clothing that we&nbsp; used, and this is on a person. You can also&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzYnhKeaJBs&t=607) inpaint the face and improve it, but this&nbsp; is really, really good by default already.&nbsp;

- [00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzYnhKeaJBs&t=612) So the second workflow is turning persons into&nbsp; a 3D figure. So let's drag and drop it here,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzYnhKeaJBs&t=619) and it is set automatically. So what you can&nbsp; set here is, again, you can set the Llama. You&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzYnhKeaJBs&t=626) can set a prompt in here. It is not mandatory,&nbsp; but you can set them. You can play with them.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzYnhKeaJBs&t=632) You can again change the model loader from GGUF&nbsp; to Flux UNET Loader with CPU dynamic offload,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzYnhKeaJBs&t=640) which is block swapping, which the Kohya is also&nbsp; using for training with very low amount of VRAM,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzYnhKeaJBs&t=646) like we can train the Flux with as low as 6 GB of&nbsp; VRAM. And that's it. It will also show the final&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzYnhKeaJBs&t=653) prompt here. So let's just run it. By the way,&nbsp; don't forget to upload the person that you want to&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzYnhKeaJBs&t=658) generate like a 3D toy, we can say. And let's just&nbsp; wait the output here. The rest is just regular&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzYnhKeaJBs&t=666) ComfyUI usage. So let's just wait. Again, on our&nbsp; channel, this video is showing you how to install&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzYnhKeaJBs&t=671) ComfyUI and how to install SwarmUI downloader,&nbsp; also SwarmUI itself. I really prefer SwarmUI,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzYnhKeaJBs&t=678) but I will be doing some more ComfyUI workflows&nbsp; hopefully as well. Our ComfyUI installer is&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzYnhKeaJBs&t=685) extremely advanced. It automatically installs all&nbsp; the best attentions and other stuff for you. Let&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzYnhKeaJBs&t=692) me show you. So we can see that it is already&nbsp; supporting Nvidia 5090. It supports also older&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzYnhKeaJBs&t=699) GPUs like 4090 or 4060, 3060, 2000, it doesn't&nbsp; matter. It supports all the GPUs, including&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzYnhKeaJBs&t=707) 5000 series. Also, we can see that it has Sage&nbsp; attention by default. It also has Flash attention&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzYnhKeaJBs&t=713) and xFormers too. So don't worry about that. So&nbsp; our ComfyUI installation is just perfect. Also,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzYnhKeaJBs&t=719) it is installed into a virtual environment so that&nbsp; you can have multiple ComfyUI installations or you&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzYnhKeaJBs&t=725) can just delete your virtual environment and&nbsp; remake it. So there is no issues, there is no&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzYnhKeaJBs&t=730) problems with that. If your ComfyUI gets broken,&nbsp; just delete the virtual environment and remake it.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzYnhKeaJBs&t=735) So this is extremely accurate and most performant&nbsp; way of installing ComfyUI without breaking any&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzYnhKeaJBs&t=742) other of your ComfyUI installations or without&nbsp; breaking your computer, without breaking any other&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzYnhKeaJBs&t=747) of your applications. And yes, we got our image.&nbsp; This is not exactly face matching, but it is kind&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzYnhKeaJBs&t=754) of matching. You can see the final prompt here&nbsp; and you can modify it according to your needs,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzYnhKeaJBs&t=761) change it, play just with it a little&nbsp; bit, and whatever you like, you will get.&nbsp;

- [00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzYnhKeaJBs&t=765) So this is how I am going to make my hopefully&nbsp; future ComfyUI. They will be just one-click to&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzYnhKeaJBs&t=771) install, one-click to use with optimizations.&nbsp; So thank you so much for watching. Subscribe&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzYnhKeaJBs&t=777) and wait for more tutorials because&nbsp; they are hopefully coming very soon.
