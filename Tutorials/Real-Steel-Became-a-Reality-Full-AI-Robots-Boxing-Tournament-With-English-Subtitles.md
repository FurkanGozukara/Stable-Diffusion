This video is from Live: CMG World Robot Competition ‚Äì Mecha fighting series with English Subtitles. China started to rule Open Source generative AI and now they are moving to robotics earlier from everyone else. Who would have guessed just after 14 years of Real Steel movie, we will have real Real Steel. And this is only the beginning. It will only get better very likely and fast. These are commercial level robots so they are cheap and weak. Still they perform excellent.

Quick Info

How Much AI vs. Human Control?

AI is dominant in:

Executing complex physical movements (walking, balancing, combos, getting up).

Low-level motor control and coordination.

Interpreting sensor data for balance and impact.

Running safety protocols.

Humans are dominant in:

Overall fight strategy and high-level decision-making.

Timing and selection of specific attacks or defenses (triggering pre-programmed AI routines).

Potentially modulating the intensity or risk of certain actions.

In essence:

Think of it like a video game character. The AI makes the character walk smoothly, perform complex attack animations, and react to physics. The human player decides when to walk, which attack to use, and the overall strategy. However, in this robot boxing, the "animations" (robot movements) are incredibly sophisticated and adaptive due to extensive AI training and real-time algorithmic control. The human operators are skilled "pilots" giving strategic instructions to a very capable AI-driven physical avatar.
