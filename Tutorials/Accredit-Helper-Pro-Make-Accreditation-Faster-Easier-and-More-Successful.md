### Video Transcription


- [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=0) Greetings. Today, I am going to introduce&nbsp; you Accredit Helper Pro. This is a software&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=5) that I have developed for my university&nbsp; accreditation process. In the beginning&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=11) of the video, I will introduce you&nbsp; its amazing, vast amount of features,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=17) then I will show how to install and use&nbsp; every feature of it. This software will&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=23) not only make your accreditation process&nbsp; 10 times easier and faster, but also,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=31) with the vast statistics that it provides, will&nbsp; help you to get your accreditation successfully.

- [00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=39) So, this is the main interface of our software.&nbsp; You see, we currently have 9 different courses.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=46) Each course has a course ID plus semester. The&nbsp; combination of these two is unique. So here,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=52) I can sort them with these options. I can&nbsp; click view, edit, or delete. Let's go to&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=58) view. For example, this is Database Management&nbsp; Systems. I have got these exams defined with&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=64) their maximum score and their weight. So, this&nbsp; application calculates the relative weights,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=71) and when we go to the All Courses Analysis, it&nbsp; will give us entire program results. And this page&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=78) is extremely detailed. You can define each course&nbsp; relative weight, like consider that their credits,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=86) if you want to get results based on that. You&nbsp; can exclude courses, and it is calculating every&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=93) program output relatively. Moreover, you can&nbsp; display their success rate based on relative&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=98) success rates. When you click the relative&nbsp; success rate, it will show you which one of&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=103) them is passing. So, what is relative success&nbsp; rate? You define if the score is above certain,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=111) then you count that program output is successful.&nbsp; For example, let's set this as 30%. So, if the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=118) scores are above 30%, they will be counted as&nbsp; successful. So, this is totally optional. You can&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=125) also display absolute success rate. Since this is&nbsp; a demo data, the scores are very close. However,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=132) when you are using, you will see it better.&nbsp; Moreover, you can define these achievement&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=137) levels yourself. When we go to the configure&nbsp; achievement levels, you can change them or add&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=142) new achievements or remove. Everything is totally&nbsp; dynamic. It is totally up to you. You can sort the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=148) results from here, or you can display only certain&nbsp; academic year, and you can export CSV. All of&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=155) the pages we have supporting export feature.&nbsp; You can also exclude or include the courses.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=162) As you exclude and include, it will change your&nbsp; program outcome averages, as you are seeing.

- [00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=168) So, you can define your program outputs, 1 to&nbsp; 11 or how many you need. You can define their&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=175) description. And when you go to the courses,&nbsp; when you go to the view program outcome scores,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=180) you will get to this page. In this page, you can&nbsp; see every course individual success rates. You can&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=188) see course outcomes success rates, and you can see&nbsp; individual scores of every student like this. So,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=195) it is totally up to you, whichever the statistics&nbsp; that you want to provide. You can sort them,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=200) you can search them. This application is designed&nbsp; with this mindset. It will support every one of&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=208) the accreditation there is out there. So,&nbsp; whatever the accreditation you are doing,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=215) this software will support it. But not only that,&nbsp; we support backup database, restore database,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=220) and import database. The application is&nbsp; 100% running locally. After installation,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=226) you don't need internet access. So, you can&nbsp; distribute this software to your teachers or&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=233) whoever is working with the accreditation process.&nbsp; Everyone can work locally, and then you can get&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=241) their backup databases and import them and merge&nbsp; every one of them. This feature is 100% working,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=249) and it will make your accreditation process&nbsp; extremely easier and more successful.

- [00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=256) Moreover, we have remote access feature.&nbsp; What does this mean is that you can run&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=262) this application with a public link&nbsp; and access it from your phone or from&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=267) another computer. The application&nbsp; will still run in your computer,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=271) but you will get a public URL that you can&nbsp; open from your work computer, from your phone,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=278) from your tablet. Application has been&nbsp; designed with mobile interface support. So,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=285) this is the public link. When I open this link, I&nbsp; am able to access it. And anyone can access this&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=291) link as long as they have this link. And this is&nbsp; still running on my machine, not running on any&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=296) server or anywhere. We just made our interface&nbsp; publicly available through Cloudflare services.

- [00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=304) We also have a very detailed help section,&nbsp; which you can search, and you can read and&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=310) learn everything step-by-step. So, this&nbsp; tutorial will cover everything, but you&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=315) can also use this help and documentation to find&nbsp; the information that you need. Let's say score,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=321) and it will show all the scores where we have in&nbsp; this documentation. But we aren't done with the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=327) features yet. You can set the each exam weight&nbsp; like this. You can set mandatory exams and&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=334) makeup exams. So, if a student entered a makeup&nbsp; exam, the student's main exam score will not&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=341) be calculated. It will automatically calculate&nbsp; the makeup exam. You can define makeup exam as&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=346) many as you want. You can also define mandatory&nbsp; exams the student has to take them. Otherwise,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=353) the student's score will not be calculated in&nbsp; the outputs, in the analysis. Moreover, we have&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=359) mass associate outcomes. This is extremely easier&nbsp; to set your questions matched with the outcomes.

- [00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=367) So, our system is working like that. You match&nbsp; your exam questions with course outcomes,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=372) then you match the course outcomes with the&nbsp; program outcomes you see on the screen. Therefore,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=379) we are matching every exam with a program&nbsp; outcome. If you don't want to make this way,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=386) you can directly write program&nbsp; outcomes in the course outcomes,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=390) so you can match that way as well. But this&nbsp; is making more sense because with this way,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=395) you are associating the exam questions with&nbsp; course outcomes, then you are associating course&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=400) outcomes with the program outcomes. You see, every&nbsp; course outcome has a program outcome association.

- [00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=407) We support batch feature wherever it is&nbsp; possible. For example, in the students,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=412) we can import students or export&nbsp; students. In the course outcomes,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=416) you can export outcomes or batch delete&nbsp; or add course outcome from here. You see,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=421) this is the interface. Moreover, when you go&nbsp; to the view of the exam, you see this is the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=427) exam interface. You can batch add questions&nbsp; like this. Let's say, for example, 10, update,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=433) and it will add 10 questions as a batch. And you&nbsp; can set the course outcomes in this interface. You&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=440) can distribute points equally based on the number&nbsp; of maximum scores. Currently, this is maximum.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=446) Then, you can also manage scores from here. You&nbsp; see, you can enter every student score easily&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=453) like this. And you can see the view accredited&nbsp; scores by clicking. This is based on this exam,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=459) not entirely. You can export scores, and when you&nbsp; export score, you will get a CSV file which you&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=465) can open with Excel. And when we say auto column&nbsp; width, you see, we have all the questions and&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=471) all the students. I also have an import format&nbsp; like this, which most of the universities are&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=477) supporting. So, you can copy this and directly&nbsp; import your exam scores into your own system.

- [00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=484) Alright, now I will show how to obtain this&nbsp; software and install it. If you want to use&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=490) the software as a department, you need to go&nbsp; to this link and buy the software from here.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=496) The link will be in the description of the video,&nbsp; so check it out. Once you purchased the software,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=501) you will have this download option to download the&nbsp; zip file. This will be limited to your department&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=507) only, but everyone in your department can use,&nbsp; such as Computer Engineering department. However,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=513) if you want to purchase as a university to use&nbsp; in all of the departments with your all staff,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=520) then you can purchase the university license. The&nbsp; link will be also in the description of the video,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=525) so check it out. By purchasing this license,&nbsp; everyone in the university or institution can&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=530) use. The licenses are lifetime, and you will&nbsp; get all of the updates. And you can message&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=536) me and tell me if there are any errors or if&nbsp; you are requesting any new feature. You can&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=541) message me anytime. So, you will get all the&nbsp; updates, and it will be permanently lifetime.

- [00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=547) Once you downloaded the zip file, extract&nbsp; it into a drive where you want to use it. I&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=552) don't recommend using special characters in&nbsp; your folder paths or space characters. So,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=558) let's extract directly into our E: drive, and you&nbsp; will get these extracted files. So, this software,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=565) this application is based on Python, and you also&nbsp; need Git. So, how you can obtain them? You see,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=571) there is installation guide here, and it&nbsp; gives you the links of the necessities. So,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=578) you need to have Python 3.10.11. You can&nbsp; use upper versions of Python, however,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=584) I didn't test. Still should work, but I recommend&nbsp; using this. If you have this in your system,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=590) even if it is not a default Python version,&nbsp; my application installer will automatically&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=594) generate a virtual environment with Python&nbsp; 3.10 and install into there. Additionally,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=599) you need to have Git installed. Once you have&nbsp; these two, then you are ready to install and start&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=605) using. If you want to use it from your phone,&nbsp; you need to also install Cloudflare exe. You see,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=612) there are two exes. Just download them and install&nbsp; them, then you will be able to generate shared&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=617) link and use it from other places like your&nbsp; from phone or from another computer and such.

- [00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=624) If you are saying that you don't know how to&nbsp; install these software, I also have a step-by-step&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=630) tutorial that I have shown how to install Python&nbsp; and Git. So, watch this tutorial video, and you&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=636) will learn it. Once you have the Python and Git,&nbsp; let's verify that. Open a CMD window like this,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=643) then just type Python, and you should get a Python&nbsp; like this: 3.10.11. Then open another CMD and type&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=651) Git, and you should get a Git message like this.&nbsp; Then you have both of the requirements. You don't&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=656) need anything else. After that, double-click&nbsp; install.bat file. Do not run as administrator.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=663) Just run with double-click or select and hit&nbsp; enter. Then it will start the installation,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=669) and it will install the application and&nbsp; the necessary libraries into a virtual&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=674) environment folder. Once the installation&nbsp; has been completed, you can even turn off&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=679) your internet access because this application&nbsp; doesn't require anything else. It will 100%&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=685) work locally without any remote server or internet&nbsp; access. So, this is 100% private and secure. Okay,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=693) you see everything has been installed, and we have&nbsp; the installation completed. Just press any key.

- [00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=699) Now, there is one option which you might want to&nbsp; do: Generate Demo Data. If you generate demo data,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=706) it will add some demo data so that you can see&nbsp; how it works. After that, click start.bat file.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=712) This will start the application and open&nbsp; it in your default browser like this. So,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=717) we started the application with demo data.&nbsp; However, what if you don't want demo data? So,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=723) let's close this CMD window, enter inside&nbsp; instance folder and just delete your database.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=729) This will reset it. Then just start.bat file,&nbsp; and it will start a fresh version like that.

- [00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=736) First of all, you need to set your program&nbsp; outcomes. So, you see, this is my university&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=742) program outcomes. From here, first of all,&nbsp; set them, like edit or delete whatever you&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=748) need. You can delete with this, and you can also&nbsp; edit them like this and give any name you want,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=754) like the program outcome 10, and this is&nbsp; my program outcome, or whatever the naming&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=762) convention you need. Then just update, and we got&nbsp; it. So, once you set all the program outcomes,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=768) we will begin with adding courses. So, let's&nbsp; add a course. I am going to add a course that I&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=774) prepared. So, this is my lecture code. Let's&nbsp; write the course code. Then let's write the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=779) course name, the lecture name, and semester.&nbsp; Now, this is super important. In this system,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=785) course code plus semester is unique. So, you can&nbsp; have the same course code, however, it will be&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=791) differentiated with the semester it has. So, let's&nbsp; say Fall 2025. And the course weight. By default,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=799) it will equally treat every one of the courses.&nbsp; But if you want to weight the outcomes based on&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=805) the, let's say, course credits, you can give them&nbsp; relative weights. Let's make this course weight&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=811) as 3 and save course. Okay, we got our course.&nbsp; Then what we need to do? Enter inside the course&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=817) by either clicking here or view. First of&nbsp; all, you need to add course outcomes. So,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=823) let's go to course outcomes and let's&nbsp; add course outcome. Okay, for example,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=828) let's add some temporary outcomes. Let's say&nbsp; Course Outcome 1. And let's give a description:&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=834) Students learn how to do numerical calculations.&nbsp; Then you need to associate it with the program&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=842) outcome. If you don't want to use course outcomes,&nbsp; you can directly write the same program outcome&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=848) here and use it. But this is a more preferred&nbsp; way. So, let's associate with Program Outcome 3&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=854) and Program Outcome 8 and save course outcome. So,&nbsp; add as many as course outcomes you need. First,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=862) do this. Let's add another one. Let's say Course&nbsp; Outcome 2. And let's say Students learn how to&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=870) use numerical tools. And let's associate with the&nbsp; Program Outcome 9 and 10 and save course outcome.

- [00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=878) Once you are done with the course outcomes,&nbsp; you can always edit them. Then you need to&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=883) add students. So, these are the students that take&nbsp; this course. You can add by one by one from here,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=891) add student, or you can import students. The&nbsp; import feature supporting so many formats.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=897) You see, all these formats are supported.&nbsp; So, let's import these students. You see,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=903) I am using just a space character, but you can&nbsp; also use semicolon or tab. Okay. Then, import&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=909) students, and 36 students have been imported.&nbsp; Let's see view student list. You see student ID,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=915) first name, and last name. We support all kind&nbsp; of student IDs, but they have to be unique within&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=920) the given course. It's a text, but they have&nbsp; to be unique in this particular course. Okay,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=927) let's return back to course from here. So, we&nbsp; have the students, we have the course outcomes,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=932) then we need to add exams. So, let's add&nbsp; our first exam. Click Add Exam. You see,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=938) click Add Exam here. Let's say Midterm.&nbsp; You can define maximum score of the exam.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=945) Everything will be calculated relatively. So,&nbsp; let's the maximum score 100. Exam date. Okay,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=950) let's make a date like 19. And is this a&nbsp; makeup exam? No. Is this a final exam? No.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=957) Is this a mandatory exam? No. Okay, relative&nbsp; weight of this exam will be 40% and add exam.

- [00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=963) Now, once we add the exam, we click the view,&nbsp; and we need to add questions. Our system supports&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=970) question-based accreditation score calculation,&nbsp; which most of the accreditation systems demand&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=978) from you, and this will also improve your&nbsp; accreditation success rate significantly. So,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=983) let's add a question from here. So, you can&nbsp; define your questions from here one by one,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=988) or you can batch add questions. Let's add 4&nbsp; questions. Update. Then let's distribute points&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=995) equally. So, you see, every question will get 25&nbsp; maximum score because my exam score was 100. Okay,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=1003) we can type like Question 1, etc., Question&nbsp; 2, etc. I recommend you to also type the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=1010) question number from here because if you delete&nbsp; question later, they will be reordered. Okay,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=1016) Question 4. And these questions need to be&nbsp; associated with the course outcomes. As I said,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=1022) if you don't want to use course outcomes, you can&nbsp; also directly write here the program outcomes,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=1028) and you can directly match. Okay, let's say Course&nbsp; Outcome 1, Course Outcome 2, 1 and 2, and 2. But&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=1034) you have to associate with at least one. Then&nbsp; save all questions. You can also edit the import&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=1040) relationships from here. Save all questions.&nbsp; You see our questions are added. After you have&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=1046) added the questions, you can edit them from here&nbsp; like this, or you can return back to batch add&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=1051) questions, add more questions to here, or you&nbsp; can also update the relationships from here.

- [00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=1059) As a next step, you can set the manage attendance&nbsp; from here. You can set as all none. You see,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=1065) automatically saved. Or all again. You see,&nbsp; automatically saved again. And you can begin&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=1071) adding scores. So, go to the manage scores&nbsp; here. You can type the scores one by one,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=1076) or at the bottom, you can also import them with&nbsp; a certain format. We support both of them. So,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=1082) let me show you how to add scores. Let's say&nbsp; this student didn't attend exam, so mark it. So,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=1089) you see, it is not attended. This student attended&nbsp; and take 15. So, we got the score. You can also&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=1096) add decimal precision score like this. So, this&nbsp; is extremely flexible. Then enter another student&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=1103) score, another student score. You see, if I type&nbsp; more than maximum score, it will not allow me.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=1109) You can enter 0, 0, 0, 0. It is all fine. It&nbsp; will calculate accordingly. Let's enter 12, 15,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=1118) 16, 25. If you don't want that particular student&nbsp; scores to be not counted, you need to check this:&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=1127) Not Attended. Otherwise, they will be counted.&nbsp; Even if I don't enter any score, they will be&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=1132) still counted as 0. And as soon as I enter a&nbsp; score, it is automatically getting saved. So,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=1139) let's return back to Midterm. Now we&nbsp; have added some scores. We have added

- [00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=1145) our questions. We can export scores and see&nbsp; them. So, this is our exported score. So,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=1151) let's make the automatic column width. And&nbsp; you see, all of our entered values are here,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=1157) and this is the format that I can import into&nbsp; my university system. I can return back to exam,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=1163) and now I can see program outcomes. However, still&nbsp; I am not at 100% weight, but still, we will see.

- [00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=1170) So, you see, currently we are all failing.&nbsp; And this is expected because when I go to&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=1175) the student results, all of our students&nbsp; are empty, 0%, and you see it says Not&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=1181) Categorized because currently I started the&nbsp; categorization from 0.1%. If I go to here,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=1191) you see there is Configure Achievement Levels.&nbsp; If I click this, the achievement is starting&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=1196) from 0.01. If I make this as 0 and save, and&nbsp; if I go back to here and go to View Program&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=1204) Outcome Scores and go to Student Results,&nbsp; now they are Failure. So, it is up to you.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=1210) You can categorize them as 0% Failure or&nbsp; Not Categorized. It is totally up to you,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=1216) and this is totally dynamic. And when I go to&nbsp; the All Courses Analysis, it will give me the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=1221) result. And as you are seeing right now, this is&nbsp; our current results. And when I hover my mouse,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=1227) it also shows the achievement levels,&nbsp; and it shows the program outputs.

- [00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=1231) So, this is the core of the application, how&nbsp; you enter courses. You can add more courses.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=1237) You can add more exams. Let's add another exam.&nbsp; For example, Add Exam, and let's say Final Exam.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=1244) Maximum score of the exam is 100. Let's change the&nbsp; date. Okay, I will mark this as a Final Exam. And&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=1251) if I don't want students missed this exam to&nbsp; be not included in the final score outcomes,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=1259) I will make this as a Mandatory Exam. So, whoever&nbsp; fails to take this exam will be excluded. And this&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=1266) is not a makeup exam. And let's make the relative&nbsp; weight 60% and Add Exam. Now I have Final Exam&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=1272) as well. I can add questions. You see, there is&nbsp; no questions yet. So, let's click the View, and&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=1278) let's add some questions. Let's add 5 questions.&nbsp; Update. Distribute equally? Yes. And we can select&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=1286) Mark All or Unmark All. You see like this. You can&nbsp; mark all or unmark all. We have all the features.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=1292) And Save All Questions. And we are ready. Now all&nbsp; the scores are by default none. And let's make&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=1299) the attendance Not Attended. And now this will&nbsp; be also included in the program outcomes. So,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=1305) our success rates are even more fallen because&nbsp; we don't have the scores yet. I can change the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=1311) weights from here, as usual, as always. I can&nbsp; set Mass Associate Outcomes. So, at this page,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=1318) you can filter by exam. Let's filter Midterm.&nbsp; And you can change this. As you change them,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=1324) they will be automatically saved. You can also&nbsp; update relationships with this format. This is&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=1330) the format that you have to follow: Q1, and let's&nbsp; say I will make the first question associated with&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=1336) only Course Outcome 2. Even if we have different&nbsp; naming here, you need to follow this. So,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=1342) the Course Outcome 2 will be always as this&nbsp; format. Then let's set the Q2, Question 2. So,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=1349) this is the format: Q1 colon, type the course&nbsp; outcomes, then semicolon, and Q2, type the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=1355) course outcomes, or whatever the question. Let's&nbsp; update Question 4. And let's make the Question&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=1360) 4 only Course Outcome 1 like this. Or let's&nbsp; make both Course Outcome 2. Okay. Then select&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=1367) the Select Exam here: Midterm. And you can apply&nbsp; import. After apply import, you see it is applied,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=1374) and it will refresh, and we should be seeing&nbsp; that. Let's filter by Midterm exam. And yes. So,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=1381) our changes are applied. Let's return back to the&nbsp; course. We can set the mandatory exam from here:&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=1387) Make Optional or Make Mandatory like this. And&nbsp; we can add another exam like a makeup exam.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=1394) This is also another important thing. Let's add&nbsp; exam. And this will be Final Exam, but it will&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=1400) be Makeup Final Exam. The name doesn't matter&nbsp; much. What matters is, this is a makeup exam,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=1406) and its original exam is Final Exam. So, the&nbsp; program will know that if the student participated&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=1414) the makeup exam, the makeup exam score will be&nbsp; used instead of the final exam, no matter the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=1420) score. Let's say student took 65 score at the&nbsp; final exam but took only 1 score, or let's say&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=1428) 0 score at the makeup exam, still the makeup exam&nbsp; score will be counted. Let's select the date. And&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=1436) this will be mandatory exam because the final&nbsp; exam is mandatory. And relative weight doesn't&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=1441) matter because it will use the weight of the final&nbsp; exam. You see? Because this is a makeup exam of&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=1448) the final exam. We can see that it is Makeup&nbsp; Exam for Final Exam here. You can, as usual,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=1454) add the questions. Before you edit the scores, you&nbsp; have to add questions, then you can edit scores.

- [00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=1461) What about utilities? When we go to the Utilities,&nbsp; All Utilities page, we have Backup Database. I&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=1467) recommend to take frequent backups. Go to Backup.&nbsp; Give a backup description: This is a test backup.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=1475) Then click Create Backup, and it will create&nbsp; a backup. When you go to the View All Backups,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=1480) you will see your generated backups. They will&nbsp; be saved inside the Backups folder here. You can&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=1487) download by clicking here. You can also restore to&nbsp; this backup from this interface or delete it. We&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=1493) also have Mass Delete option from here. You see,&nbsp; it will also show the description of the backup&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=1499) as well. And this is a regular type backup. Then&nbsp; what about if you want to restore back? As I said,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=1503) you can restore from here or go to the Restore&nbsp; Database. You can choose it from your computer,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=1509) or you can use from here, select it, and&nbsp; Restore. You see like this? Click Restore,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=1514) and it will restore it. Before you restore,&nbsp; it will automatically take your existing&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=1519) backup copy as well. And you can also Import&nbsp; Database. This is also very crucial thing. Okay,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=1526) let's make it like this to show the import&nbsp; feature. I will add some demo data. So,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=1532) let's click Generate Demo Data. It will ask me to&nbsp; add or not because I already have some data. So,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=1539) let's add yes. Okay. Let's go to the Backup.&nbsp; And let's say Test 2. Create Backup. Okay,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=1545) we have the backups. Let's download this. Then I&nbsp; will restore back to my older one. So, you see,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=1550) currently I have these courses. When I click this,&nbsp; it is all filled with the demo data. I can see&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=1557) everything. Okay, let's go to the Utilities&nbsp; and Restore Database. Let's restore to this&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=1562) one. This is an older one. Restore. Okay, it says&nbsp; that everything will be gone. I understand, and&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=1567) Restore. And it is restored. Just wait. And yes,&nbsp; we are returned back to our older. When I go to&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=1573) the Restore Database, now we can see Pre-Restore.&nbsp; So, if you make a mistake, we still keep it in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=1580) backups. Now I will do Import. How can I make&nbsp; an import? Let's go to the Backup Database,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=1586) View All Backups. I will download my Pre-Restore,&nbsp; or let's download this one. Then go to the Import&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=1593) and choose a file and select it. I will import&nbsp; everything. I recommend that. I understand. Import&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=1600) and Merge. It has imported the database. Let's go&nbsp; to the courses. Existing courses will be skipped.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=1607) So, since I already had this one, it is skipped.&nbsp; How does it check? It checks this Course ID plus&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=1614) Semester combination. And it is merged. Now I&nbsp; can see the results. You see, everything is here.

- [00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=1621) So, let's go to the All Courses&nbsp; Analysis page. This is an important,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=1625) one of the most important pages. This is the main&nbsp; data we provide to the accreditation centers. So,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=1631) this is where we gather all of the data&nbsp; we have. Currently, this is our result. We&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=1637) can set different weights for each one. So, this&nbsp; course is successful. You see, when I click this,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=1644) it will also open that course from here. So, let's&nbsp; make its weight more to get a higher success rate.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=1652) So, these are our current achievement levels.&nbsp; Let's make this like 10 credits. Let's make it&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=1657) 10. Save changes. And now we have way better&nbsp; results. However, currently we don't have&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=1663) achievement levels for global. And when I go&nbsp; to Configure Achievement Levels, it will add&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=1668) the default ones. And when I return back, you&nbsp; will see the default achievements here. So,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=1674) we have all the default achievement levels, and&nbsp; our courses are performing like this right now.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=1680) So, if I exclude this one from here, Exclude this&nbsp; course from calculations, it will be excluded,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=1687) and I will get even better scores because&nbsp; it will not take down my overall success&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=1692) rate. If I return back to course weight 1, I&nbsp; will get a slightly lower success rate. So,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=1698) this is where you can set everything. You can&nbsp; set relative weight like this. And you can also&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=1704) display relative success rate. Because, let's say&nbsp; you want to count if your program outcome is above&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=1711) 50%. Or let's say, if you want to count a student&nbsp; is successful if the student score is above 50%,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=1720) then you can set as a relative success rate of&nbsp; the student. So, you see, this way I will get way,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=1726) way better success rates. Depending on the&nbsp; situation, if my all students are above 60%,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=1733) then I will get 100% success rate. Because this&nbsp; is what I did set. You see Success Threshold. For&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=1738) example, let's open this one. You see, currently&nbsp; this is all 100% success rate. And when I go to&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=1745) the students, I can see that. Everyone is above&nbsp; 60%. Let's make it exactly as 75% because some&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=1751) of them will pass and some of them will fail in&nbsp; that case. So, let's go back to the All Courses&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=1756) page from here. And this is our successful. Let's&nbsp; make this exactly as 75% and save. Then, you see,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=1765) half of them passes and half of them not. When I&nbsp; refresh here now, okay, the charts are updated.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=1771) Let's go to the student results. And we can see&nbsp; their... these are absolute success rates. So,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=1776) if it is below 75%, now it is relatively 0%.&nbsp; But if it is above 75%, like this student, it&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=1785) is 100%. So, when you use it, you will understand&nbsp; it better. It is totally up to you. You can just&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=1792) go with the absolute success rate, and you will&nbsp; get all the scores according to the exams. The&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=1798) weights of the exams will also matter, not the&nbsp; max score, but the weights. So, based on the max&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=1804) score and the student score, it will calculate&nbsp; its impact based on the weight of the exam.

- [00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=1811) Making this program this detailed was extremely&nbsp; hard task, but I have tested it thoroughly. And if&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=1820) you find any bugs in the program, if you encounter&nbsp; any error, you can always message me. You can&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=1826) message me from Patreon or go to the Help and go&nbsp; to the Contact and Support. You can also message&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=1832) me from LinkedIn. And you can also email me or&nbsp; message me your ideas, your new feature requests.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=1839) It's all fine. This document is excellently&nbsp; made. It is also up to date. So, you can&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=1845) read everything here to understand what you are&nbsp; trying to understand better: outcomes, courses,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=1852) exams and questions, students and scores, how the&nbsp; entire application work is explained here. You can&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=1859) also reply to this video with your question, and&nbsp; hopefully, I will answer that as soon as possible.

- [00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=1865) So, we seen the backup, restore, import. We also&nbsp; have Merge Courses, but this is experimental and&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=1872) not recommended. However, still, you can try this&nbsp; and see if it is useful for you. We also have&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=1877) System Logs where you can see some of the logs&nbsp; like this. Let's say you opened a shared link&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=1883) and you shared that with your colleagues. All of&nbsp; you can work on this application at the same time,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=1889) even if it is running on a single computer.&nbsp; This is also totally possible. However,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=1893) your actions may override each other,&nbsp; so it can be a little bit dangerous,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=1898) but it still should work perfectly fine as long&nbsp; as you work on different courses at the same time.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=1905) We have action types from here. We have from date&nbsp; to date and Show Entries. Everything is here. So,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=1911) let's go back to All Utilities. And Remote Access,&nbsp; I have shown that in the beginning of the video.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=1917) So, when you open with Remote Access, you can&nbsp; access it from everywhere. And this application&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=1922) is supporting mobile as well. So, let's open&nbsp; the developer view and let's click this to&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=1930) see its mobile output. So, with this resolution&nbsp; phone, it will look like this. This is a very,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=1937) very big advantage of this program because this&nbsp; allows you to work even from your phone or your&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=1944) tablet, wherever you want to work from, you can&nbsp; work on this application. And everything will be&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=1949) still running on your computer and saved on your&nbsp; computer, not on your phone or not on your tablet.

- [00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=1955) You may be asking, is this software only for&nbsp; Windows? No. This is a Python-based application.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=1962) Therefore, you can look these installers&nbsp; and install it on Mac or on Linux systems&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=1968) as well. It is pretty straightforward&nbsp; if you know how to use those systems.

- [00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=1973) So, how you can update the application? All&nbsp; you need to do is just close the application&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=1978) and double-click update_app.bat file. It will&nbsp; update the application to the latest version.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=1985) Time to time, you can check the Patreon post&nbsp; to download latest zip file because if I update&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=1991) the installer files, there is no way to update it&nbsp; from here. You need to get the latest version from&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=1996) the Patreon post. And as I said, the license is&nbsp; lifetime, so you can access it anytime you want.

- [00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=2003) This is all. If you have any questions,&nbsp; just message me, email me, and hopefully,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=2008) I will help you as soon as possible. Just read&nbsp; the application interface very clearly because&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=2016) we have everything. Also, you can click here&nbsp; or here to open that course, as I have shown.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=2021) You can click Course Outcomes, Student Results.&nbsp; You can sort them from here to see. By the way,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=2026) the export will follow your sorting option. For&nbsp; example, if I sort with the score, top to bottom,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=2033) and export student results, the results will&nbsp; be sorted with the overall score. You see,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=2039) descending order. So, you can do this sorting.&nbsp; You can also search students from here. You&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=2044) see Search Students. For example, with the&nbsp; name, it will filter. Or with the student ID,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=2050) like this. You see, it is filtering based on&nbsp; here. So, use the search bar here to search&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=2056) the students. You can Show All, Hide All, Show&nbsp; Details. You can also exclude students from&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=2062) calculation. Let's say exclude, and this student&nbsp; will be excluded from all of the calculations,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=2068) from the course outputs, from the all&nbsp; courses analysis. So, for whatever reason,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=2074) if you want to exclude any student for any&nbsp; particular reason from any particular course,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=2080) you can just go to the students and from&nbsp; here exclude, include, or from the View&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=2086) Program Outcomes, Student Results, and from here&nbsp; exclude or include as well. It is all possible.

- [00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=2092) So, I tried to make this application as much&nbsp; as possibly robust and make it fit for all of&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=2099) the accreditations out there. If you want to&nbsp; know which version of the app you are using,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=2105) go to the very bottom of the page, and you&nbsp; will see the application version. From here,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=2111) you can understand the which version you are&nbsp; using. And when you update the application,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=2116) you may see this version has been updated.&nbsp; Thank you so much for watching. If you&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=2121) have any questions, just contact with&nbsp; me, and hopefully, I will reply you&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=2126) as soon as possible. You can reply to this&nbsp; video, or you can message me from Patreon,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=2132) or you can email me that I have shown you my&nbsp; email here. You see, furkangozukara@gmail.com,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=2139) or you can contact me from my LinkedIn. Hopefully,&nbsp; see you in future amazing videos. And hopefully,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=2145) I will add more features to this application upon&nbsp; your requests. And if there are any errors you&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6E9IF8SkoA&t=2152) encounter, just report me error in details, and&nbsp; hopefully, I will fix them as soon as possible.
