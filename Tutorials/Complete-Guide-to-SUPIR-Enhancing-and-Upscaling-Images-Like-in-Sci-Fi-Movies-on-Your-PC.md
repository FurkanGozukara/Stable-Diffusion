In this video, I explain how to 1 click install and use the most advanced image upscaler / enhancer in the world that is both commercially and open source available. The upscaler that I am going to introduce you is open source #SUPIR and the model is free to use. SUPIR upscaler is many times better than both paid Topaz AI and Magnific AI and you can use this upscaler on your computer for free forever. The difference of SUPIR vs #Topaz and #Magnific is like ages. So in this tutorial you are going to learn everything about how to install, update and use SUPIR upscaler on your personal computer. The video shows Windows but it works perfectly fine on Linux as well.

Scaling Up to Excellence: Practicing Model Scaling for Photo-Realistic Image Restoration In the Wild : [https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13627](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13627)

Authors introduce SUPIR (Scaling-UP Image Restoration), a groundbreaking image restoration method that harnesses generative prior and the power of model scaling up. Leveraging multi-modal techniques and advanced generative prior, SUPIR marks a significant advance in intelligent and realistic image restoration. As a pivotal catalyst within SUPIR, model scaling dramatically enhances its capabilities and demonstrates new potential for image restoration. Authors collect a dataset comprising 20 million high-resolution, high-quality images for model training, each enriched with descriptive text annotations. SUPIR provides the capability to restore images guided by textual prompts, broadening its application scope and potential. Moreover, Authors introduce negative-quality prompts to further improve perceptual quality. Authors  also develop a restoration-guided sampling method to suppress the fidelity issue encountered in generative-based restoration. Experiments demonstrate SUPIR's exceptional restoration effects and its novel capacity to manipulate restoration through textual prompts.

### Video Transcription


- [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYxVEvDf284&t=0) It is now possible to enhance images like&nbsp; in the science fiction movies; however,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYxVEvDf284&t=5) it is not a fiction anymore. With the SUPIR&nbsp; application that we developed based on the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYxVEvDf284&t=11) open source SUPIR model, it is now possible to get&nbsp; such a level of enhancement with only 8 GB GPU,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYxVEvDf284&t=18) so even if you have a very old GPU that doesn't&nbsp; even support BF16, you will be able to use our&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYxVEvDf284&t=25) application on your computer, and today I am going&nbsp; to show you everything about this amazing open&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYxVEvDf284&t=32) source application. We have added so many features&nbsp; to this upscaler, currently version 46, and we&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYxVEvDf284&t=39) have so many new features that you are going to&nbsp; enjoy and like. Such as currently, our upscaler&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYxVEvDf284&t=45) even works with 8 GB GPUs even on old GPUs like&nbsp; 1080 or 2080. So this is the very best upscaler&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYxVEvDf284&t=57) right now with one-click installer, and today&nbsp; I am going to show you how to install, upgrade,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYxVEvDf284&t=62) update on Windows. We have so many new features.&nbsp; For example, we are able to generate a comparison&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYxVEvDf284&t=69) video immediately like this, and as you are seeing&nbsp; right now, it is a video with any resolution&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYxVEvDf284&t=76) and FPS and duration that you can generate. This&nbsp; upscaler also has so many other features that are&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYxVEvDf284&t=82) embedded. I know that there are some workflows for&nbsp; Comfy UI, but this is very easy to use. We have&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYxVEvDf284&t=89) prompt styles. We are able to, on the fly, change&nbsp; the model as you are seeing. We have checkpoint&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYxVEvDf284&t=96) type. We are also supporting SDXL Lightning.&nbsp; We have embedded LLaVA, so when you click this&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYxVEvDf284&t=102) LLaVA, it will automatically generate the caption&nbsp; for you. We have batch processing. Just enter the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYxVEvDf284&t=109) folders. We have advanced parameter settings,&nbsp; quality, and fidelity automatically setting&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYxVEvDf284&t=114) everything for you. We have face restoration,&nbsp; and both of the options are working either. You&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYxVEvDf284&t=121) can restore only the face of the image, or you&nbsp; can restore only the background of the image,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYxVEvDf284&t=125) or you can restore both of them. When we go to&nbsp; the restored faces, we can see from this face to&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYxVEvDf284&t=131) this face, and none of the existing upscaler will&nbsp; give you such quality with such loyalty to the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYxVEvDf284&t=138) original image. We also have generated comparison&nbsp; video. You see, you can set duration, FPS, width,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYxVEvDf284&t=145) and height. We have randomized seed. We have&nbsp; the number of images to generate with different&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYxVEvDf284&t=149) seeds. We have batch size. Moreover, we also have&nbsp; video processing, but it is not fully working yet.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYxVEvDf284&t=156) Hopefully, we will make it. So this is the very&nbsp; best upscaler that you can use right now with&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYxVEvDf284&t=161) one click. You can change the upscale size as you&nbsp; are seeing. We have amazing improvements for the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYxVEvDf284&t=168) reduced VRAM and speed up and also displaying&nbsp; processing. So how are we going to install this&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYxVEvDf284&t=175) upscaler? First of all, you need to have installed&nbsp; python, git, and if you want video options, you&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYxVEvDf284&t=182) need to have installed FFmpeg. The link of this&nbsp; post will be in the description of the video when&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYxVEvDf284&t=188) we go to the how to install and requirements, you&nbsp; will see that you need to have installed python.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYxVEvDf284&t=193) So how do you know that you have installed python?&nbsp; Open a CMD window like this and type python,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYxVEvDf284&t=201) and you should get 3.10.11 or 3.10.6. However, if&nbsp; you install 3.11 or 3.12, it will not work. So you&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYxVEvDf284&t=209) need to have default python set up as 3.10.11. I&nbsp; suggest that 3.10.11. 3.10.11 works with other AI&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYxVEvDf284&t=217) applications such as Automatic1111 web UI, Kohya,&nbsp; OneTrainer, any other thing. So if you don't&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYxVEvDf284&t=223) know how to install these, there is a link here.&nbsp; And also on my channel, this video will show you&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYxVEvDf284&t=229) everything that you need, how to install Python,&nbsp; Git, and FFmpeg. Let's also verify our FFmpeg&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYxVEvDf284&t=237) installation and Git installation. You see when&nbsp; I type ffmpeg, I see the version. Let's also type&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYxVEvDf284&t=243) git because these are important, and Git is also&nbsp; installed. If you don't install these, it will not&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYxVEvDf284&t=249) work. Or if you install different Python versions&nbsp; like 3.11, 3.12, it will not work. However,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYxVEvDf284&t=256) any version of 3.10.X should work. Okay, after&nbsp; that, go to the very bottom, and you will see&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYxVEvDf284&t=262) SUPIR version 46. Download it. I will also&nbsp; show how to upgrade your existing installation&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYxVEvDf284&t=271) or move the existing models. So let's move this&nbsp; into our F drive, x, copy-paste here, extract into&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYxVEvDf284&t=279) version 46. If you are installing the first time,&nbsp; just double-click Windows_Install.bat file,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYxVEvDf284&t=285) and it will automatically install everything for&nbsp; you and download everything for you. However,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYxVEvDf284&t=290) in some cases, some people are having issues&nbsp; downloading models because there are so many&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYxVEvDf284&t=296) models to download. So what you can do in that&nbsp; case, I will generate multiple folders so we&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYxVEvDf284&t=303) can see. So let's download all of the models with a&nbsp; single zip file. This zip file can be resumed and&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYxVEvDf284&t=310) can be downloaded from your browser. Click it.&nbsp; It will start downloading 33 GB zip file like&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYxVEvDf284&t=317) this as you are seeing right now. You can pause&nbsp; this, resume this, or you can increase the download&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYxVEvDf284&t=322) speed with the downloader like you uGet. uGet get is free. Actually, let me show you. Let's&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYxVEvDf284&t=328) download the uGet from here. It has download queue and a lot of options.

- [00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYxVEvDf284&t=333) So let's download for Windows. These are open source application free&nbsp; one. Let's click this. If you can't extract it,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYxVEvDf284&t=341) you can install Winrar, but Windows should be able&nbsp; to extract it. You see it is getting extracted.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYxVEvDf284&t=347) Let's also cancel this to show you from uGet.&nbsp; This is not mandatory. However, in some cases,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYxVEvDf284&t=354) downloads of the models with the CMD window&nbsp; may fail. So I will show you an alternative way.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYxVEvDf284&t=360) Enter inside extracted uGet folder. Enter&nbsp; inside. Double click uGet exe. Then click&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYxVEvDf284&t=366) file. New download. Copy this URL. Right click, copy&nbsp; link address. Paste here. Also, wherever you&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYxVEvDf284&t=373) want to download, let's pick the downloads folder.&nbsp; For example, here. OK. And you can make it like 16&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYxVEvDf284&t=381) connections to download faster. Click OK. And it&nbsp; will start downloading. You uGet download is extremely&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYxVEvDf284&t=387) high speed because it can start multiple downloads at the same time. It has resume option, pause&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYxVEvDf284&t=394) option. You see when I pause and then I can click&nbsp; resume as well to resume it. I think we click&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYxVEvDf284&t=400) runnable or let's say for start. Yes. And it will&nbsp; start. And you see the download speed is amazing.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYxVEvDf284&t=407) And the third option is what if you want to update&nbsp; your existing installation? So I go to the version&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYxVEvDf284&t=414) 45. This was my previous installation. Then I just&nbsp; click update version, and it will update to the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYxVEvDf284&t=421) latest version like this. However, in some cases,&nbsp; we may change the requirements. In that case,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYxVEvDf284&t=428) you can double click update Windows requirements,&nbsp; and it is going to update all the necessary&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYxVEvDf284&t=433) libraries automatically for you like this. OK. The&nbsp; third option is moving your existing model files.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYxVEvDf284&t=441) To do that, I will first delete the downloader.py&nbsp; file. Then I will start Windows install as usual.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYxVEvDf284&t=449) Then wait until SUPIR folder appears here. Then&nbsp; inside here, delete this download models.py file.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYxVEvDf284&t=456) Then what you need to do is: you need to move your&nbsp; existing model files into there. So the models were&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYxVEvDf284&t=464) here. So I just cut this to move them into my&nbsp; newest installation, which is here inside SUPIR.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYxVEvDf284&t=472) And paste it. And then I moved my existing model&nbsp; files. It may give you several errors because&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYxVEvDf284&t=480) that the file is missing. However, it is not important&nbsp; because it will complete all the installation&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYxVEvDf284&t=485) automatically for you. So currently uGet is&nbsp; using my entire network. You see 500 megabits per&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYxVEvDf284&t=493) second download. This is my maximum speed. And you&nbsp; can see that it is downloading with 66 megabytes&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYxVEvDf284&t=499) per second. So you can delete the downloader files&nbsp; and download with the uGet. And then we will&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYxVEvDf284&t=507) extract the downloaded models into our folder.&nbsp; However, you can also wait for the command line&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYxVEvDf284&t=514) interface, download and install as well. uGet download has been completed. And also,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYxVEvDf284&t=520) the automatic installer is also downloading&nbsp; models. The download speed of the Python,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYxVEvDf284&t=526) the automatic installer is slower than uGet as&nbsp; expected. But this will also download everything.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYxVEvDf284&t=533) All right. The entire installation has been&nbsp; completed. You can see that virtual environment&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYxVEvDf284&t=538) made and installed properly. However, before&nbsp; closing this window, I suggest you look through&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYxVEvDf284&t=545) all of the messages like this, as you are seeing&nbsp; right now. I am going to show you entire messages&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYxVEvDf284&t=551) right now. As I am moving, I am checking that&nbsp; if there are any errors or not because it is&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYxVEvDf284&t=558) important to verify everything is installed&nbsp; accurately. You will also get this error.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYxVEvDf284&t=564) Don't worry, the installer is fixing this error&nbsp; afterward. And also, this part is super important.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYxVEvDf284&t=571) Verify that every model is accurately downloaded&nbsp; as you are seeing right now. In some cases,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYxVEvDf284&t=577) you may get errors while downloading. Computer may&nbsp; have problems while downloading. In that case,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYxVEvDf284&t=584) I suggest you use this as a base and download. So&nbsp; after you downloaded this way, how are you going&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYxVEvDf284&t=592) to use it? Let's go to the downloaded folder.&nbsp; Let's cut it. Then move to our installed folder,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYxVEvDf284&t=598) for example, SUPIR version 49 paste here. This is&nbsp; a huge file. A lot of models are being downloaded&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYxVEvDf284&t=607) because it includes also LLaVA Captioner and some&nbsp; of the checkpoints that we are going to use. Then&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYxVEvDf284&t=613) when we open this, you will see that there is&nbsp; models. So I can enter inside this folder, and&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYxVEvDf284&t=619) I can just drag and drop these models into here.&nbsp; So it will extract the models folder into here,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYxVEvDf284&t=626) and it will ask me to replace because I already&nbsp; have downloaded everything. Alternatively,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYxVEvDf284&t=633) you can do this. You can move this into the&nbsp; SUPIR folder and just right-click and click&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYxVEvDf284&t=638) extract here. It will ask you to replace&nbsp; files. You see the both files are the same.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYxVEvDf284&t=644) Just click yes to all. This is Winrar by the&nbsp; way, this is free. You can also install this,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYxVEvDf284&t=649) and it will extract everything into there. So&nbsp; I will cancel this operation because I already&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYxVEvDf284&t=655) have downloaded. There is one crucial thing that&nbsp; you need to be aware of. When you are installing&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYxVEvDf284&t=661) our SUPIR. Don't make the parent folder name&nbsp; the same as SUPIR. You see this folder name is&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYxVEvDf284&t=667) SUPIR version 49. So don't make this as SUPIR like&nbsp; this because it may cause errors. So always give&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYxVEvDf284&t=675) a custom name, a different name than the SUPIR.&nbsp; So both of the parent folder name and the folder&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYxVEvDf284&t=681) name is not SUPIR. They are different. Okay. After&nbsp; installation, how do we start? You will see that&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYxVEvDf284&t=688) there is Windows_Start_SUPIR_app.bat file. Double&nbsp; click it. It will ask you options. Now these&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYxVEvDf284&t=695) options are super important. The first option&nbsp; is half precision, and if you have a 24 GB GPU,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYxVEvDf284&t=701) you can start this. There is also FP8 precision.&nbsp; This will use a minimal amount of VRAM. Actually,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYxVEvDf284&t=709) there is no quality difference between FP8 and&nbsp; BF16. So you can also use this even though you&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYxVEvDf284&t=716) have high VRAM and there is also full precision.&nbsp; This is for very high VRAM GPUs. So let's say you&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYxVEvDf284&t=722) have 8 GB, 12 GB GPU select option 2 then this&nbsp; is super important. If you need speed, then select&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYxVEvDf284&t=731) FP8 then in here, select start without Tiled VAE.&nbsp; However, this will use a lot of VRAM. So if you&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYxVEvDf284&t=738) have 12 GB or 8 GB, start using Tiled VAE&nbsp; or let's say you are going to do high-resolution&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYxVEvDf284&t=745) upscale again, use start Tiled VAE. So I am&nbsp; going to start Tiled VAE. This is going to&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYxVEvDf284&t=753) reduce our speed like 50% even more. So if you&nbsp; need speed, you can rent a higher VRAM GPU from&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYxVEvDf284&t=761) Massed Compute. We already have Massed Compute&nbsp; installation, and hopefully, I'm going to make a&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYxVEvDf284&t=766) tutorial for that or we already have installer&nbsp; for RunPod with instructions. You see RunPod

- [00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYxVEvDf284&t=771) instructions and also we have Massed Compute&nbsp; instructions. So rent a like 40 GB GPU, 48 GB GPU&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYxVEvDf284&t=780) and you can use without Tiled VAE to get the best&nbsp; speed. Then there is also keep models always in&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYxVEvDf284&t=787) GPU. This will be a little bit faster than start&nbsp; with auto move to CPU. If you have limited VRAM,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYxVEvDf284&t=794) then again start with auto move to the CPU. Then&nbsp; you can either start with a light theme or dark&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYxVEvDf284&t=800) theme. I will start with a light theme because&nbsp; I like it. There is also available command line&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYxVEvDf284&t=806) arguments. When you open this, you will see all&nbsp; of the command line arguments and what they do.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYxVEvDf284&t=811) One of the most important ones is share option.&nbsp; If you provide share, it will give you a Gradio Live

- [00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYxVEvDf284&t=818) link. And then there is also a very important&nbsp; one, which is the checkpoint directory. So you can&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYxVEvDf284&t=827) give a different directory to your start argument&nbsp; and use a different directory. When you edit this&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYxVEvDf284&t=833) Windows_Start_SUPIR_app, you will see the options&nbsp; here and you will see some examples. For example,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYxVEvDf284&t=840) with this argument, I am going to give this as a&nbsp; single checkpoint. Also, I can give model folder.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYxVEvDf284&t=849) So let's go back to the command line arguments&nbsp; here, and you'll see checkpoint directory. So if&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYxVEvDf284&t=855) you want to give a different checkpoint directory,&nbsp; copy paste this here with -- and then give&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYxVEvDf284&t=861) the folder path. Let's say I wanted to give this&nbsp; folder as a checkpoint. So I copy this and paste&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYxVEvDf284&t=867) it here like this. So it is going to use this&nbsp; as a checkpoint folder when I start next time.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYxVEvDf284&t=873) Moreover, if you don't want to keep pressing&nbsp; options each time we have Windows start directly&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYxVEvDf284&t=881) here Windows_Direct_Start_No_Options, you&nbsp; can see the options that it is going to start&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYxVEvDf284&t=886) with. It is going to start with half parameters,&nbsp; FP8, Tiled VAE and open browser and outputs folder and&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYxVEvDf284&t=893) our app started with options selected as 2,1,1,1,&nbsp; and it will automatically open a browser interface&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYxVEvDf284&t=902) like this. So this is the interface that we&nbsp; are going to use, and there are several key&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYxVEvDf284&t=907) things that you need to be careful here. We have&nbsp; already information buttons like this, so you can&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYxVEvDf284&t=913) click these buttons to see what they do, and then&nbsp; let's upload an image that we want to upscale.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYxVEvDf284&t=919) You can simply upscale everything. However, face&nbsp; restoration may not work on every image. You can&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYxVEvDf284&t=926) also upscale your DreamBooth generated images. For&nbsp; example, this is one of my images. Let's upscale&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYxVEvDf284&t=932) it into the higher resolution. Minimum upscale&nbsp; resolution is 1024 for the lower dimension. So&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYxVEvDf284&t=940) you need to increase it slowly from here to go&nbsp; to the target resolution that you want. Let's&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYxVEvDf284&t=947) upscale this into 2x. So it is going to become&nbsp; 4 megapixels. I am going to apply the LLaVA,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYxVEvDf284&t=954) and I am going to use one of the models. Okay,&nbsp; let's refresh. Yeah, currently, these are the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYxVEvDf284&t=961) models because we were overriding the previous&nbsp; model. As you remember, we canceled it, so we can&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYxVEvDf284&t=967) also download the checkpoints from here. We can&nbsp; download these ones currently. Moreover, you can&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYxVEvDf284&t=974) request me to add more downloads here. I'm going&nbsp; to use my DreamBooth generated model to restore my&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYxVEvDf284&t=980) face because that image is DreamBooth generated&nbsp; image. And if you wonder what is DreamBooth,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYxVEvDf284&t=986) how do we finetune ourselves? I recently released&nbsp; a masterpiece tutorial here. It is over 2 hours.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYxVEvDf284&t=993) Watch it to learn how to train a DreamBooth, how to train Stable Diffusion. So the checkpoint&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYxVEvDf284&t=998) that I'm going to use is here. I will copy it.&nbsp; Then I am going to move back into SUPIR, inside&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYxVEvDf284&t=1005) models, inside checkpoints. This is where we put&nbsp; models. I will copy paste it. You don't need to&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYxVEvDf284&t=1011) restart your application after copy paste. I&nbsp; will click this refresh, and I will select my&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYxVEvDf284&t=1016) model. I will let it generate the prompt. Then I&nbsp; am going to use a custom prompt for my face: photo&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYxVEvDf284&t=1022) of ohwx man. This is my activation prompt. I am&nbsp; going to enable background restoration and face&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYxVEvDf284&t=1029) restoration. Moreover, you can enable this auto unload LLaVA. If you have a low VRAM to make it work,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYxVEvDf284&t=1036) then there are settings. Now these settings are&nbsp; very important. As you make this higher it will&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYxVEvDf284&t=1042) make more dramatic changes to the image. So if the&nbsp; image is too different then reduce it like 5.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYxVEvDf284&t=1049) So it will reduce the effect of the image. Then&nbsp; there is also you will see the prompt style:&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYxVEvDf284&t=1055) as you change this, this will change the LLaVA&nbsp; prompt and also the default positive and default&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYxVEvDf284&t=1062) negative prompts here. You see this application is&nbsp; extremely advanced. We have worked a lot on it. So&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYxVEvDf284&t=1068) let's return back to the photo-realistic, and we&nbsp; also have batch processing. For batch processing&nbsp;

- [00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYxVEvDf284&t=1074) just set the input folder and output folder&nbsp; and click process batch, and it will do batch&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYxVEvDf284&t=1079) processing. Okay, did we set everything? We set&nbsp; to apply LLaVA so it will auto-generate the prompt&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYxVEvDf284&t=1085) for me. I will return back to this to the face prompt.&nbsp; This is important. Apply SUPIR. Apply SUPIR&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYxVEvDf284&t=1091) means that it will upscale image. Save captions&nbsp; means that auto-generated captions will be saved.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYxVEvDf284&t=1097) I will show and everything is set. We can also&nbsp; generate a comparison video. However, for this&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYxVEvDf284&t=1103) to work, you need to have FFmpeg installed so the&nbsp; output resolution is like this. Let's also set&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYxVEvDf284&t=1109) the output resolution of the video here, and then&nbsp; all you need to do is click process single. First,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYxVEvDf284&t=1116) it will load the LLaVA and generate a caption.&nbsp; Everything is visible on the interface and also&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYxVEvDf284&t=1122) on the CMD window. Always look for the CMD window.&nbsp; Don't forget that the first-time model loadings&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYxVEvDf284&t=1129) will be always slower. So patiently wait the&nbsp; consequent process single, process batch will be&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYxVEvDf284&t=1137) faster than the first time. Moreover, if you are&nbsp; limited with the RAM memory, you should increase&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYxVEvDf284&t=1143) your virtual RAM memory. How to increase it? Type&nbsp; control panel and inside control panel go to the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYxVEvDf284&t=1150) system then in here you will see advanced system&nbsp; settings in here you will see advanced tab and&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYxVEvDf284&t=1157) in here you will see settings. Click that and in&nbsp; here you will go to the advanced tab and in here&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYxVEvDf284&t=1163) you will see virtual memory, change it, set your&nbsp; device. I prefer you to set it on a faster disk,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYxVEvDf284&t=1170) and you can change the size from here like 50,000&nbsp; and you will get a 50,000 virtual memory. Okay,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYxVEvDf284&t=1177) after this change, you need to restart. So the&nbsp; upscale already started, and 50 steps already&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYxVEvDf284&t=1184) completed, we are going to get the image. However,&nbsp; if it was able to detect the face in this image,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYxVEvDf284&t=1190) it will also upscale the face separately. So&nbsp; there will be two upscales Yes, probably it is&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYxVEvDf284&t=1196) going to happen. Yes, first upscaled face then&nbsp; it is going to upscale the other part. So it is&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYxVEvDf284&t=1202) going to do 2 upscales. If your upscale is too&nbsp; slow, then start your task manager. Let me show&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYxVEvDf284&t=1209) you, right click, start task manager, go to the&nbsp; performance tab, and in here you will see your&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYxVEvDf284&t=1216) GPU and pay attention to the shared GPU memory.&nbsp; If it starts using shared GPU memory, then it will&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYxVEvDf284&t=1224) become 20 times 30 times slower than expected.&nbsp; So what you can do to prevent such an issue,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYxVEvDf284&t=1231) you need to reduce your used VRAM before you start&nbsp; upscaling. How you can do that, you can go to the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYxVEvDf284&t=1239) startup, disable all of the startups, restart your&nbsp; computer, and it will minimize your VRAM usage.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYxVEvDf284&t=1245) Moreover, you can reduce your target resolution&nbsp; because the more the target resolution, it will&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYxVEvDf284&t=1250) use more VRAM, and if still, it is not sufficient,&nbsp; then you need to rent a cloud service. However,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYxVEvDf284&t=1258) even with 8 GB GPUs, currently, you are able to&nbsp; upscale your images at least to 1 megapixel,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYxVEvDf284&t=1265) perhaps more. Moreover, we are supporting FP16&nbsp; GPUs as well. So this application is many more&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYxVEvDf284&t=1273) times advanced than the original SUPIR released&nbsp; application by the developers. So the upscale has&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYxVEvDf284&t=1280) been completed. Let's compare in the full screen,&nbsp; and here from left, right, you see, you can&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYxVEvDf284&t=1288) pay attention to the armor. It became many times&nbsp; better. The armor became many times better. The&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYxVEvDf284&t=1295) face is looking 100% high quality,&nbsp; no degrade in quality, or it is still my face. It&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYxVEvDf284&t=1303) is perfectly loyal to the original, and this is&nbsp; a SUPIR upscale. There is no other application&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYxVEvDf284&t=1311) that can upscale as good as this one. You can try&nbsp; also different base models. You can try to change&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYxVEvDf284&t=1317) your prompt. It will affect it significantly.&nbsp; The prompt is super important. Let's return&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYxVEvDf284&t=1323) back to the original. So like this. So where&nbsp; are these images are saved when you go to the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYxVEvDf284&t=1328) open outputs folder, you will see the images are&nbsp; saved inside outputs. We can see also the metadata&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYxVEvDf284&t=1335) of the image. Every image you can see. Also you can see the prompt that it is used. You can&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYxVEvDf284&t=1342) see the prompt. This is automatically saved.&nbsp; And this is the generated image. You see, it is&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYxVEvDf284&t=1347) 2048 to 2048 pixels. Moreover, we have another&nbsp; amazing feature. When you go to the outputs,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYxVEvDf284&t=1355) you can drag and drop your image here to see its&nbsp; metadata. So I will drag and drop my image into&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYxVEvDf284&t=1362) here like this. Pay attention to this red border,&nbsp; and it will load the metadata in a moment. Yes,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYxVEvDf284&t=1370) you see used base model, time, megapixel,&nbsp; everything, default positive prompt, auto encoder&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYxVEvDf284&t=1376) data type. Whatever the option you used is&nbsp; saved here so that you can generate this image&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYxVEvDf284&t=1383) again. Currently, we don't have load these&nbsp; parameters. However, I will hopefully add that&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYxVEvDf284&t=1389) into here, so you will be able to click a button&nbsp; here, and it will set everything as the same&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYxVEvDf284&t=1394) as that metadata. Now I am going to make a&nbsp; super important comparison to explain to you,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYxVEvDf284&t=1402) show you the difference of the samplers and&nbsp; the text guidance scale (text CFG). So I prepared an&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYxVEvDf284&t=1410) imgsli com comparison. When you click this&nbsp; link, you will get to this page. And in here,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYxVEvDf284&t=1417) we can compare the effect of different stuff.&nbsp; For example, let's do full scale. And you see&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYxVEvDf284&t=1424) that the face restoration significantly improves&nbsp; the face's quality. So the face restoration is&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYxVEvDf284&t=1432) extremely important. The defaults have face&nbsp; restoration, and only one option doesn't have&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYxVEvDf284&t=1438) face restoration. And you can see it significantly&nbsp; improves the faces, and the base version is here.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYxVEvDf284&t=1445) Let's also see base version versus upscaled.&nbsp; You see the base version is like this,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYxVEvDf284&t=1451) and this is the final version that we are getting.&nbsp; The difference is just like black and white. Just&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYxVEvDf284&t=1458) so dramatic. And about the EDM versus DPMPP2M.&nbsp; The EDM is more loyal to the original image,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYxVEvDf284&t=1469) meanwhile, DPMPP2M will make the image more sharper,&nbsp; add more details. However, its loyalty will be&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYxVEvDf284&t=1478) a little bit off. So if your image is getting like&nbsp; burned, then I suggest you use EDM. For example,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYxVEvDf284&t=1485) let's compare 7.5. Moreover, as you&nbsp; increase the text CFG value, it will make more&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYxVEvDf284&t=1491) dramatic changes. So reduce the text CFG to get&nbsp; more loyal images. But you can see the difference&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYxVEvDf284&t=1500) of EDM versus DPMPP2M. So choose EDM if you need&nbsp; more loyal image or use the DPMPP2M as default.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYxVEvDf284&t=1512) If you need more crisp, more advanced images, the&nbsp; link will be in the Patreon post. So click it and&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYxVEvDf284&t=1519) see the difference on your computer to decide it.&nbsp; If you have any further questions and requests,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYxVEvDf284&t=1525) please message me from Patreon or reply to this&nbsp; YouTube video. Play with every parameter here,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYxVEvDf284&t=1533) read the descriptions, and you will become&nbsp; the master of upscaling. This is the very best&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYxVEvDf284&t=1539) upscaler. We also support SDXL Lightning version.&nbsp; So it will be many times faster because when you&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYxVEvDf284&t=1546) go to the SDXL Lightning, you will only do&nbsp; 10 steps to get the best quality. However,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYxVEvDf284&t=1553) there is a quality difference. The Lightning is&nbsp; not as good as standard SDXL. Moreover, don't&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYxVEvDf284&t=1558) forget to change your model to the Lightning when&nbsp; you do this. So you need a Lightning model for it&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYxVEvDf284&t=1565) to work. Hopefully, see you in another amazing&nbsp; tutorial. Thank you so much for supporting me.
