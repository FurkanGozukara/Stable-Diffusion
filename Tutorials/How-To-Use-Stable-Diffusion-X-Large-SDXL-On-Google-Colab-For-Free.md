### Video Transcription


- [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2MQqmv6yAg&t=0) Greetings everyone.

- [00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2MQqmv6yAg&t=1) In this video, I will show you how to use latest Stable Diffusion SDXL 0.9 on Google

- [00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2MQqmv6yAg&t=7) Colab.

- [00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2MQqmv6yAg&t=8) I have prepared a GitHub readme file.

- [00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2MQqmv6yAg&t=11) The link of this file will be in the description of the video and also in the comment section

- [00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2MQqmv6yAg&t=14) of the video.

- [00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2MQqmv6yAg&t=15) Click this link to open Google Colab.

- [00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2MQqmv6yAg&t=17) To be able to use SDXL, you need to have a Hugging Face account and accept terms and

- [00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2MQqmv6yAg&t=24) services for Stable Diffusion SDXL version.

- [00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2MQqmv6yAg&t=28) First of all, click this link.

- [00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2MQqmv6yAg&t=30) You need to be logged in in your Hugging Face account.

- [00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2MQqmv6yAg&t=34) Currently, I am logged in into my account.

- [00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2MQqmv6yAg&t=37) Then you will see here accept terms and services.

- [00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2MQqmv6yAg&t=41) You need to accept it.

- [00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2MQqmv6yAg&t=42) It will automatically verify you and then you will have this screen.

- [00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2MQqmv6yAg&t=47) Then you need to generate an access token.

- [00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2MQqmv6yAg&t=49) Click this link.

- [00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2MQqmv6yAg&t=51) You will get to this screen.

- [00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2MQqmv6yAg&t=52) Here click new token.

- [00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2MQqmv6yAg&t=54) Give any name.

- [00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2MQqmv6yAg&t=55) Give, role read and write.

- [00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2MQqmv6yAg&t=57) Copy.

- [00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2MQqmv6yAg&t=58) Then in here, copy paste your access token.

- [00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2MQqmv6yAg&t=61) Don't worry, this will be only visible to you.

- [00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2MQqmv6yAg&t=63) No one else will see it.

- [00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2MQqmv6yAg&t=65) Click connect in here.

- [00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2MQqmv6yAg&t=67) This is really important.

- [00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2MQqmv6yAg&t=69) Make sure that you have connected and you have GPU.

- [00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2MQqmv6yAg&t=72) If you don't have a GPU, click change runtime and get a GPU.

- [00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2MQqmv6yAg&t=76) It works with a free GPU.

- [00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2MQqmv6yAg&t=78) These are my notebook settings.

- [00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2MQqmv6yAg&t=80) Then click play this icon.

- [00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2MQqmv6yAg&t=82) Click run anyway.

- [00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2MQqmv6yAg&t=83) Okay, we did set our access token.

- [00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2MQqmv6yAg&t=85) Click this play icon.

- [00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2MQqmv6yAg&t=87) It will download and install all of the necessary models, weights and requirements for running

- [00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2MQqmv6yAg&t=93) SDXL.

- [00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2MQqmv6yAg&t=95) Once the installation has been completed, you will see the green checkmark here and

- [00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2MQqmv6yAg&t=100) it will show you a play icon like this.

- [00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2MQqmv6yAg&t=103) Then run this cell below.

- [00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2MQqmv6yAg&t=104) This will start a new gradio interface that we will use.

- [00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2MQqmv6yAg&t=109) Once the files are downloaded and requirements are installed, you will get a running on public

- [00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2MQqmv6yAg&t=114) URL link like this.

- [00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2MQqmv6yAg&t=116) Click it.

- [00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2MQqmv6yAg&t=117) And here now we have our own Stable Diffusion SDXL 0.9 version.

- [00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2MQqmv6yAg&t=123) This is all for us.

- [00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2MQqmv6yAg&t=124) We can use it as much as we want.

- [00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2MQqmv6yAg&t=126) This is running in this Google Colab.

- [00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2MQqmv6yAg&t=129) As long as we run this, this will run.

- [00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2MQqmv6yAg&t=132) There are advanced settings.

- [00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2MQqmv6yAg&t=133) By default, it generates 4 images at the same time with 50 steps.

- [00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2MQqmv6yAg&t=138) There is refiner steps.

- [00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2MQqmv6yAg&t=139) I haven't tested them yet.

- [00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2MQqmv6yAg&t=141) I just got access.

- [00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2MQqmv6yAg&t=142) So I am just making a video for you.

- [00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2MQqmv6yAg&t=144) And there is also guidance scale.

- [00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2MQqmv6yAg&t=145) This is CFG as we know.

- [00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2MQqmv6yAg&t=148) So one of our discord member told me to use this as a prompt.

- [00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2MQqmv6yAg&t=152) I will use it.

- [00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2MQqmv6yAg&t=153) Okay, I have entered my prompt.

- [00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2MQqmv6yAg&t=155) I will generate an image.

- [00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2MQqmv6yAg&t=156) And we will see.

- [00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2MQqmv6yAg&t=158) When the first time you generate an image, it will load all of the weights into the VRAM

- [00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2MQqmv6yAg&t=163) and memory.

- [00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2MQqmv6yAg&t=164) Therefore, it will take some time.

- [00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2MQqmv6yAg&t=166) You will see the generation process here.

- [00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2MQqmv6yAg&t=169) Currently, it is taking 3.10 seconds per it, but we are generating four images at the same

- [00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2MQqmv6yAg&t=175) time.

- [00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2MQqmv6yAg&t=176) So to get the correct it we need to multiply this by 4.

- [00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2MQqmv6yAg&t=181) So it becomes like 0.75 seconds per it which makes 1.3 it per second for Stable Diffusion

- [00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2MQqmv6yAg&t=189) SDXL on a free Google Colab notebook.

- [00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2MQqmv6yAg&t=193) Once you see the process 100%, be patient, the images will appear here.

- [00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2MQqmv6yAg&t=199) It is taking about 150 seconds to generate four images with 50 steps.

- [00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2MQqmv6yAg&t=205) I will also hopefully make a tutorial for RunPod and to run it on your computer as well.

- [00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2MQqmv6yAg&t=211) So it will probably run much faster on those platforms.

- [00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2MQqmv6yAg&t=214) Okay, these are the images we got.

- [00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2MQqmv6yAg&t=217) Wow, looking very amazing, very beautiful.

- [00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2MQqmv6yAg&t=220) This is also decent and cute.

- [00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2MQqmv6yAg&t=222) Wow, this is also pretty good, pretty amazing.

- [00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2MQqmv6yAg&t=225) These are native 1k resolution.

- [00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2MQqmv6yAg&t=228) Finding out the prompts and finding what is possible with Stable Diffusion SDXL is up

- [00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2MQqmv6yAg&t=233) to you.

- [00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2MQqmv6yAg&t=234) So stay subscribed to see the new tutorials.

- [00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2MQqmv6yAg&t=237) Hopefully see you later.
