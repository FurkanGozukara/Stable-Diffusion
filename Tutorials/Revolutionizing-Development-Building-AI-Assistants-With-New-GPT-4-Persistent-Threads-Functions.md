### Video Transcription


- [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnVlYm9j9h4&t=0) But this is a developer conference, and the&nbsp; coolest thing about this is that we're bringing&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnVlYm9j9h4&t=4) the same concept to the API. Many of you have&nbsp; already been building agent-like experiences&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnVlYm9j9h4&t=16) on the API. For example, Shopify's Sidekick,&nbsp; which lets you take actions on the platform;&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnVlYm9j9h4&t=23) Discord's CDE lets Discord moderators create&nbsp; custom personalities for; and Snap's My AI,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnVlYm9j9h4&t=30) a customized chatbot that can be added to&nbsp; group chats and make recommendations. These&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnVlYm9j9h4&t=34) experiences are great, but they have been&nbsp; hard to build, sometimes taking months,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnVlYm9j9h4&t=40) teams of dozens of engineers. There's&nbsp; a lot to handle to make this custom&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnVlYm9j9h4&t=44) assistant experience. So today, we're making&nbsp; that a lot easier with our new Assistance API.

- [00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnVlYm9j9h4&t=56) The Assistance API includes persistent&nbsp; threads, so you don't have to figure out&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnVlYm9j9h4&t=60) how to deal with long conversation history,&nbsp; a built-in retrieval code interpreter,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnVlYm9j9h4&t=66) a working Python interpreter, and a&nbsp; sandbox environment, and of course,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnVlYm9j9h4&t=70) the improved function calling that we talked&nbsp; about earlier. So we'd like to show you a&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnVlYm9j9h4&t=76) demo of how this works, and here is Raman,&nbsp; our head of developer experience. Welcome.

- [00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnVlYm9j9h4&t=80) R: Thank you, S. Good morning! Wow, it's fantastic&nbsp; to see you all here. It's been so inspiring to see&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnVlYm9j9h4&t=93) so many of you infusing AI into your apps. Today,&nbsp; we're launching new modalities in the API, but&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnVlYm9j9h4&t=100) we are also very excited to improve the developer&nbsp; experience for you all to build assistive agents.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnVlYm9j9h4&t=106) So, let's dive right in. Imagine I'm building&nbsp; Wust, a travel app for global explorers,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnVlYm9j9h4&t=112) and this is the landing page. I've actually used&nbsp; GP4 to come up with these destination ideas,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnVlYm9j9h4&t=117) and for those of you with a keen eye, these&nbsp; illustrations are generated programmatically&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnVlYm9j9h4&t=122) using the new DALL-E 3 API, available to all of&nbsp; you today. So it's pretty remarkable. But let's&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnVlYm9j9h4&t=129) enhance this app by adding a very simple assistant&nbsp; to it. This is the screen we're going to come&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnVlYm9j9h4&t=134) back to in a second. First, I'm going to switch&nbsp; over to the new Assistant Playground. Creating&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnVlYm9j9h4&t=139) an assistant is easy; you just give it a name,&nbsp; some initial instructions, a model‚Äîin this case,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnVlYm9j9h4&t=145) I'll pick GP4 Turbo‚Äîand here, I'll also&nbsp; go ahead and select some tools. I'll turn&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnVlYm9j9h4&t=150) on the code interpreter and retrieval and save.&nbsp; And that's it! Our assistant is ready to go. Next,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnVlYm9j9h4&t=158) I can integrate with two new primitives of this&nbsp; Assistance API: threads and messages. Let's take a&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnVlYm9j9h4&t=164) quick look at the code. The process here is very&nbsp; simple. For each new user, I will create a new&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnVlYm9j9h4&t=171) thread, and as these users engage with their&nbsp; assistant, I will add their messages to the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnVlYm9j9h4&t=176) threads‚Äîvery simple. And then, I can simply run&nbsp; the assistant at any time to stream the responses&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnVlYm9j9h4&t=182) back to the app. So, we can return to the app and&nbsp; try that in action. If I say, "Hey, let's go to

- [00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnVlYm9j9h4&t=190) Paris." Alright, that's it. With just a few lines&nbsp; of code, users can now have a very specialized&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnVlYm9j9h4&t=198) assistant right inside the app. And I'd like&nbsp; to highlight one of my favorite features here:&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnVlYm9j9h4&t=204) function calling. If you have not used it&nbsp; yet, function calling is really powerful,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnVlYm9j9h4&t=209) and as Sam mentioned, we're taking it a step&nbsp; further today. It now guarantees JSON output&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnVlYm9j9h4&t=215) with no added latency, and you can invoke multiple&nbsp; functions at once for the first time. So here,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnVlYm9j9h4&t=221) if I carry on and say, "Hey, what are the top 10&nbsp; things to do?" I'll have the assistant respond&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnVlYm9j9h4&t=229) to that again, and here, what's interesting&nbsp; is that the assistant knows about functions,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnVlYm9j9h4&t=234) including those to annotate the map&nbsp; that you see on the right. And so now,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnVlYm9j9h4&t=238) all of these pins are dropping in&nbsp; real-time here. Yeah, it's pretty

- [00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnVlYm9j9h4&t=243) cool. And that integration allows our&nbsp; natural language interface to interact&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnVlYm9j9h4&t=252) fluidly with components and features of our&nbsp; app, and it truly showcases now the harmony&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnVlYm9j9h4&t=257) you can build between AI and UI, where the&nbsp; assistant is actually taking action. But next,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnVlYm9j9h4&t=264) let's talk about retrieval. And retrieval is about&nbsp; giving our assistant more knowledge beyond the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnVlYm9j9h4&t=269) immediate user messages. In fact, I got inspired,&nbsp; and I already booked my tickets to uh, to Paris,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnVlYm9j9h4&t=275) so I'm just going to drag and drop here this&nbsp; PDF. While it's uploading, I can just sneak&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnVlYm9j9h4&t=280) peek at it‚Äîvery typical United flight ticket.&nbsp; And behind the scene here, what's happening is&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnVlYm9j9h4&t=286) that retrieval is reading these files, and boom,&nbsp; the information about this PDF appeared on the

- [00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnVlYm9j9h4&t=292) screen. And this is, of course, a very tiny PDF,&nbsp; but assistants can parse long-form documents from&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnVlYm9j9h4&t=301) extensive text to intricate product specs,&nbsp; depending on what you're building. In fact,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnVlYm9j9h4&t=305) I also booked an Airbnb, so I'm just going to&nbsp; drag that over to the conversation as well.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnVlYm9j9h4&t=310) And by the way, we've heard from so many of you&nbsp; developers how hard that is to build yourself.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnVlYm9j9h4&t=315) You typically need to compute embeddings,&nbsp; you need to set up chunking algorithms. Now,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnVlYm9j9h4&t=319) all of that is taken care of. And there's&nbsp; more than retrieval. With every API call,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnVlYm9j9h4&t=325) you usually need to resend the entire conversation&nbsp; history, which means setting up a key-value store,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnVlYm9j9h4&t=331) that means like handling the context window,&nbsp; serializing messages, and so forth. That&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnVlYm9j9h4&t=336) complexity now completely goes away with this new&nbsp; stateful API. But just because Aonia is managing&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnVlYm9j9h4&t=342) this API does not mean it's a black box. In fact,&nbsp; you can see the steps that the tools are taking&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnVlYm9j9h4&t=348) right inside your developer dashboard. So here,&nbsp; if I go ahead and click on threads, this is the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnVlYm9j9h4&t=354) thread I believe we're currently working on, and&nbsp; see, like these are all the steps incl the fun
