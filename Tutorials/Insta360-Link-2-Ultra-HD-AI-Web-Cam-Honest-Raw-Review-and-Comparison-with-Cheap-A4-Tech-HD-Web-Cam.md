I have purchased Insta360 Link 4K Ultra HD AI Webcam to improve the video quality. So I did a quick comparison test and review. 60 FPS arrived to 1080p after latest firmware update. Installer software : [https://www.insta360.com/download/insta360-link2](https://www.insta360.com/download/insta360-link2)

Used the Insta360 Link 2 microphone for testing with only Noise Suppression filter. So it has a lot of room echo and other issues. But we see its quality.

Hopefully future tutorial and guide videos will be better.

The camera is working seamlessly without any configuration as soon as you plugin. It is is just amazing.

Before this I had purchased Razer Kiyo Pro Webcam and it was not even working. It was terrible user experience so i refunded it.

Moreover, in this video I compared Insta360 Link 4K with my existing webcam A4 Tech 1080p PK-910H which I was using in all of the previous tutorials.

The difference and quality improvement is just mind blowing and huge.

### Video Transcription


- [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tN9RlJfxiUE&t=0) Hello everyone. Currently, I am doing a test&nbsp; comparison with the newest webcam that I have&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tN9RlJfxiUE&t=6) purchased to improve the quality of my videos that&nbsp; I am recording for you. On the left, we see that&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tN9RlJfxiUE&t=13) A4Tech HD 1080p camera. It's a very cheap camera.&nbsp; It's a very cheap webcam. And on the right, we see&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tN9RlJfxiUE&t=21) the newest Insta360 Link 2 webcam. The right one&nbsp; is running at 4k resolution at 30 fps the left&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tN9RlJfxiUE&t=30) one is running at HD resolution. It is also 30&nbsp; fps. Unfortunately, the Insta360 Link 2 is also&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tN9RlJfxiUE&t=39) not supporting 60 fps. But it is fine. I think the&nbsp; quality improvement is just amazing. So I believe&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tN9RlJfxiUE&t=47) this is one of the best webcams that you can&nbsp; purchase. The sound is also coming from Insta360&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tN9RlJfxiUE&t=54) Link 2 right now. Moreover, I didn't do any&nbsp; configuration. This is what it comes with default&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tN9RlJfxiUE&t=60) configuration, I just plugged it into the Windows&nbsp; 11 and it is working right out of the box. I just&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tN9RlJfxiUE&t=68) added it into the OBS Studio and it is working&nbsp; amazingly without any issues. This is also really&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tN9RlJfxiUE&t=74) important. Before this, I have purchased another&nbsp; webcam, but it was very, very bad. I had to refund&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tN9RlJfxiUE&t=80) it. The camera that I had refunded was Razer Kiyo&nbsp; Pro. It was also a very expensive camera. However,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tN9RlJfxiUE&t=89) it didn't work. It didn't work at all. It was&nbsp; constantly disconnecting. It was not even working.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tN9RlJfxiUE&t=95) But this camera right out of the box is working&nbsp; amazingly. Insta360 Link 2. So you are seeing its&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tN9RlJfxiUE&t=103) quality. You are seeing its comparison. Currently,&nbsp; the room doesn't have any proper lighting. I only&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tN9RlJfxiUE&t=109) have a ring lighting above me. Let me turn it off.&nbsp; And when it is turned off, it is like this right&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tN9RlJfxiUE&t=114) now. Also, you see the quality of the sound. I&nbsp; don't know how it is good or not, but this is the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tN9RlJfxiUE&t=121) camera right out of the box in a not very good&nbsp; lighting having room. It also has an automatic&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tN9RlJfxiUE&t=128) tracking. Let me demonstrate to you. You see it.&nbsp; It is moving with me as I move. This is also its&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tN9RlJfxiUE&t=134) cool feature. So you can also disable this. You&nbsp; can find more information. But I think when you&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tN9RlJfxiUE&t=140) are purchasing a webcam, the most important thing&nbsp; is how it looks compared to the others. And you&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tN9RlJfxiUE&t=146) are seeing it right now. I think it is pretty&nbsp; decent, pretty good. Now I will show you the full&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tN9RlJfxiUE&t=150) screen of&nbsp;the both camera so you can see the&nbsp; difference. Ok. Currently I am at the A4Tech&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tN9RlJfxiUE&t=157) HD 1080 pixels Camera. So this is how it looks,&nbsp; this is the quality of it. And you are seeing it&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tN9RlJfxiUE&t=164) right now. The ring light is also turned off. So&nbsp; now let's see the other camera. Actually, let us&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tN9RlJfxiUE&t=170) open the ring light. So we can see. So this is how&nbsp; it looks when I open the ring light above my head.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tN9RlJfxiUE&t=176) Ok. Now I have switched to the Insta360 Link 2.&nbsp; This webcam. And you are seeing its quality. The&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tN9RlJfxiUE&t=184) head ring light is now open. This is the quality&nbsp; as you are seeing right now. Let's move. Let's&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tN9RlJfxiUE&t=190) move a little bit to see. You see. Okay right&nbsp; here. So it is able to track me very well. It's&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tN9RlJfxiUE&t=196) really cool actually! A cool feature. And this&nbsp; is the quality. I think the quality is very good.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tN9RlJfxiUE&t=201) Let's turn off the ring light. Okay. This is how&nbsp; it looks on a you know not a very good lightning&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tN9RlJfxiUE&t=208) having room. Thank you so much, hopefully the&nbsp; future videos will be better, in better quality.
