### Video Transcription


- [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwMngohRmHg&t=0) Greetings everyone. Today I am going to&nbsp; introduce you the newest published FramePack,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwMngohRmHg&t=6) which is the very best image-to-video&nbsp; animation framework at the moment.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwMngohRmHg&t=12) This is just mind-blowing and different&nbsp; than others, and I will explain you why,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwMngohRmHg&t=17) and I will show you how to install and use this&nbsp; application on your Windows computer locally.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwMngohRmHg&t=24) Moreover, I have published installers for&nbsp; RunPod and Massed Compute as well. This is&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwMngohRmHg&t=30) a rush video. This application will get&nbsp; so many new features, but if you want to&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwMngohRmHg&t=35) start using it from the first day, the very&nbsp; first day, this is the video that you need.

- [00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwMngohRmHg&t=39) Frame Pack has been published by the legendary&nbsp; lllyasviel. This guy, lllyasviel, is the inventor&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwMngohRmHg&t=49) of ControlNet, IC-ReLight, Paints Undo, Fooocus, and&nbsp; Forge Web UI. So this is a legendary guy. Whatever&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwMngohRmHg&t=58) this guy makes is being really, really epic.&nbsp; So this is another case. Why? Because with this&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwMngohRmHg&t=65) model, you can generate up to 120 seconds videos.&nbsp; Moreover, it doesn't change the speed or the VRAM&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwMngohRmHg&t=74) requirement of the generation. So you can increase&nbsp; the duration. It is working as low as 6 GB of VRAM&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwMngohRmHg&t=82) having GPUs, and my installer supports TeaCache and&nbsp; Sage Attention, just one click to install for you.

- [00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwMngohRmHg&t=90) So I am currently generating three videos on&nbsp; three separate instances. And how you are going to&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwMngohRmHg&t=96) download and install this application? As usual,&nbsp; I have prepared a one-click installer for you.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwMngohRmHg&t=103) The link of this post will be in the description&nbsp; of the video. Download the latest installer zip&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwMngohRmHg&t=108) file into your computer by clicking here or in&nbsp; the attachments. Before starting installation,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwMngohRmHg&t=114) this is super important, you need to follow&nbsp; Windows requirements. So follow this video,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwMngohRmHg&t=120) apply every step, then you can begin installation.&nbsp; So let's move this file into a disk we want to&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwMngohRmHg&t=127) install. I am going to install into my Q drive.&nbsp; You need around 50 GB of free disk space. Then&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwMngohRmHg&t=135) extract all into zip file. And all you need to&nbsp; do is just double-click Windows install.bat file,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwMngohRmHg&t=142) More info, Run anyway. And it will&nbsp; automatically start the installation&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwMngohRmHg&t=146) for you. It is fully automatic. And you see&nbsp; this video has been completed. The resemblance,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwMngohRmHg&t=152) the accuracy, everything is just perfect.&nbsp; And this was a very simple prompt. It was a&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwMngohRmHg&t=158) talking handsome man. You see how well it can&nbsp; keep the accuracy of the input image and how&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwMngohRmHg&t=164) well it can animate. It is using Hunyuan&nbsp; as a back end, and hopefully, he may add&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwMngohRmHg&t=169) Wan 2.1 support as well. Hunyuan is a little bit&nbsp; lower quality than the Wan 2.1, but it is perfect.

- [00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwMngohRmHg&t=177) So if we look at the details, FramePack is&nbsp; the next frame prediction neural network.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwMngohRmHg&t=182) Frame Pack can process very large number of&nbsp; frames. You see 120 seconds is actually 3,600&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwMngohRmHg&t=190) frames because the generated videos are 30&nbsp; FPS. And it is working as low as 6 GB GPU&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwMngohRmHg&t=196) memory. It is just amazing. The installation&nbsp; is almost ready. And during the generation,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwMngohRmHg&t=202) it will also show you every second of the video.&nbsp; So once the first second generated, it will show&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwMngohRmHg&t=208) you. Once the second second generated, it will&nbsp; show you. Once the third second generated,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwMngohRmHg&t=212) it will show you. This is one of the very best,&nbsp; very cool features of this application. This&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwMngohRmHg&t=218) is running on RunPod. Therefore, there may&nbsp; be a delay of getting the finished frames,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwMngohRmHg&t=224) but in your local computer, you won't have it.&nbsp; For example, this is running on my local computer,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwMngohRmHg&t=229) and this is running on Massed Compute.&nbsp; Again, because of the Gradio live share,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwMngohRmHg&t=235) we have some delay, but when it is generating on&nbsp; your computer, you won't have it. I will show you.

- [00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwMngohRmHg&t=240) Okay, the installation has been&nbsp; completed. How do I know? You see,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwMngohRmHg&t=243) it says that FramePack installed, check out all&nbsp; the messages. Now, how we are going to start it?&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwMngohRmHg&t=249) Let me close my existing running application. And&nbsp; currently, I am using like 4 GB of VRAM, 4.5. The&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwMngohRmHg&t=256) new installation is here. I am going to start the&nbsp; application. There is one very crucial thing which&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwMngohRmHg&t=262) I will show you. So when you first time start&nbsp; it, it will start downloading the necessary&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwMngohRmHg&t=267) models into the models folder. And you see the&nbsp; models download is starting. It is really fast&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwMngohRmHg&t=274) because I am optimizing for speed. However, there&nbsp; is one issue with this. If your download fails for&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwMngohRmHg&t=281) any reason because of the Hugging Face, what you&nbsp; need to do is open this Windows startup.bat file,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwMngohRmHg&t=289) open it with any Notepad or any text editor. I&nbsp; will open it in Notepad. Then you need to set&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwMngohRmHg&t=297) this, you see here, you need to set this as zero,&nbsp; save and start again. This will fix your download&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwMngohRmHg&t=304) issue. It will be slower, however, it will fix&nbsp; it. It is up to you. If you get downloads error,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwMngohRmHg&t=310) you can restart the process and it will continue&nbsp; from wherever it is left, or you can edit this&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwMngohRmHg&t=316) .bat file. I prefer editing in Notepad++ and set&nbsp; this equal to zero. This is a common problem that&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwMngohRmHg&t=323) I have been getting asked. Therefore, I really&nbsp; recommend to do that. So the models will be get&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwMngohRmHg&t=329) downloaded and the application will start. I will&nbsp; continue with my already installed instance. Okay,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwMngohRmHg&t=335) this is my already installed instance and the&nbsp; models will be inside here. Okay, let's start the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwMngohRmHg&t=340) application. It will load the models into the CPU&nbsp; first. Okay. So the application has been started.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwMngohRmHg&t=346) Let's make a quick demo. I will use this image,&nbsp; and as a prompt, you can type the prompt yourself.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwMngohRmHg&t=352) However, I will use the Google Studio AI because&nbsp; it is free. And how am I using? Write a Hunyuan&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwMngohRmHg&t=360) prompt to animate this image. We can actually&nbsp; make this even better, but this is just a simple&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwMngohRmHg&t=366) prompt. Hunyuan image-to-video prompt. Okay,&nbsp; let's make it like this and upload our image.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwMngohRmHg&t=373) It is here. By the way, you can use this for free&nbsp; on Google Studio AI, the Gemini 2.5 Pro. Okay,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwMngohRmHg&t=381) let's run. This model is really, really good. It&nbsp; is also up to date, so it knows Hunyuan video as&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwMngohRmHg&t=387) well. You can see how it is thinking. Okay, it&nbsp; made a prompt. So let's copy this prompt and paste&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwMngohRmHg&t=394) it here. There are some other options. TeaCache,&nbsp; this will increase speed, but you can turn it off&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwMngohRmHg&t=401) to get better quality. Seed parameter, total video&nbsp; length, how many seconds you want. Let's generate&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwMngohRmHg&t=408) 10 seconds video. How many steps? This is not&nbsp; recommended to change, it is 25. Distilled CFG,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwMngohRmHg&t=414) this is also not recommended to change. And GPU&nbsp; inference preserved memory. You can increase this,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwMngohRmHg&t=420) and if you increase it, it will become slower.&nbsp; So I am only leaving as 6. And currently,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwMngohRmHg&t=427) how much VRAM I am using? I am using like 5 GB&nbsp; of VRAM. How am I seeing this window? Because&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwMngohRmHg&t=433) this window is super important. Open a terminal,&nbsp; type pip install nvitop like this, then just type&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwMngohRmHg&t=441) nvitop. And you will see your GPU memory usage.&nbsp; Whatever the application you are using, you&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwMngohRmHg&t=445) shouldn't use entire VRAM because it will start&nbsp; using shared VRAM and it will become very slow.

- [00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwMngohRmHg&t=450) Okay, I already started adding new features such&nbsp; as video quality because the default application&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwMngohRmHg&t=457) generated videos' encodings were not great.&nbsp; So I have improved it. High quality will save&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwMngohRmHg&t=464) with a very high quality, medium, low, and we&nbsp; also have web option, web compatible. Moreover,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwMngohRmHg&t=470) I have added additional exports. So now you can&nbsp; also save generated videos as GIF or animated PNG&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwMngohRmHg&t=478) or WebP. So you can also share them as a image on&nbsp; any platform. Hopefully, many more features will&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwMngohRmHg&t=484) be coming. So this is just the initial release of&nbsp; the application. Okay, we did set everything and&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwMngohRmHg&t=491) start generation. This is the first version of&nbsp; the application. Hopefully, I will add so many&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwMngohRmHg&t=495) new features. If you have feature suggestions, you&nbsp; can message me from Patreon or reply to this video&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwMngohRmHg&t=502) or from Discord, and hopefully, I will help you&nbsp; and add those features. Okay, let's see what is&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwMngohRmHg&t=508) happening right now. It is starting to load model&nbsp; into VRAM. Whichever the AI application you are&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwMngohRmHg&t=514) working, you need to pay attention how much watt&nbsp; it is using. If it is using almost full watts of&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwMngohRmHg&t=522) your GPU, that means that the application is&nbsp; working perfect. Because it will not use full&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwMngohRmHg&t=527) power or close to the full power when it is using&nbsp; shared VRAM. So you need to pay attention to how&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwMngohRmHg&t=534) much watt your GPU is using. The more it uses,&nbsp; that means the application is working better&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwMngohRmHg&t=539) and more efficient. Currently, I am at like 400&nbsp; watts. I am also recording a video. 450 watts.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwMngohRmHg&t=546) This is a really good value. So I am utilizing my&nbsp; GPU pretty well. So almost done the first second&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwMngohRmHg&t=553) of the video, and once it is completed, it will&nbsp; show you. So this application generating video&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwMngohRmHg&t=559) by every second. You see the first second of&nbsp; the video has been generated. Now it will start&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwMngohRmHg&t=564) generating the second second of the video. This is&nbsp; useful. Why? Because you are seeing the progress&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwMngohRmHg&t=570) and you can cancel it, and we are generating it&nbsp; live right now. So you see this is the live speed.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwMngohRmHg&t=577) And in the beginning, it will take longer, then&nbsp; it will get faster. This is how TeaCache working.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwMngohRmHg&t=583) It is basically skipping some of the steps based&nbsp; on the previous generation. This is how T-Cache&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwMngohRmHg&t=590) works. You can look the details if you want. But&nbsp; as you progress in steps, it will skip and become&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwMngohRmHg&t=596) faster. Okay, the second is almost done. And yes,&nbsp; the second second is also generated. Now this will&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwMngohRmHg&t=605) get updated to display the, yes, you see? Now I&nbsp; can see 2 seconds of the video. Then I will see&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwMngohRmHg&t=612) the 3 seconds of the video and so on. This will&nbsp; continue up to 10 seconds of generation. We can&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwMngohRmHg&t=619) watch live what is happening, how much VRAM we are&nbsp; using. We are using pretty good amount of VRAM. It&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwMngohRmHg&t=625) is really, really optimized. This works as low as&nbsp; 6 GB GPUs as I said, but if you have more VRAM,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwMngohRmHg&t=632) it will use more VRAM and it will be faster. Okay,&nbsp; let's look our other generations. Wow. This is&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwMngohRmHg&t=639) just epic. This is a 30 FPS video. You see the&nbsp; quality, the resemblance, the accuracy. And you&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwMngohRmHg&t=646) see my input image doesn't have a hand, but this&nbsp; video have has a hand, and this is just epic. And&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwMngohRmHg&t=652) the hand itself is really, really accurate as&nbsp; you can see. Or in this video, we see the such&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwMngohRmHg&t=658) accuracy. Let's look at this video as well. This&nbsp; was a hard video. I wonder what it do. Okay, let's&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwMngohRmHg&t=663) see. Okay, I think this one failed. Yes. So I need&nbsp; a better prompt probably. This was just a simple&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwMngohRmHg&t=671) prompt. And the generated videos are saved inside&nbsp; outputs folder. You can see them. Actually, it is&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwMngohRmHg&t=677) also saving every generation. You see? So this&nbsp; is the 4-second video. So you can terminate the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwMngohRmHg&t=683) process wherever and whenever you want. The video&nbsp; resolution is currently 544 to 704. I think it&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwMngohRmHg&t=691) changes according to each image. Yes, this looks&nbsp; like a bigger 480 to 862. Hopefully, I will also&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwMngohRmHg&t=699) try to add resolution to this application, add&nbsp; more features to this application. This is a rush&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwMngohRmHg&t=704) publish because I wanted to show you at the first&nbsp; day. This application was published just 9 hours&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwMngohRmHg&t=711) ago. So I am rushing right now. So what about how&nbsp; to use on Massed Compute and RunPod? We already have&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwMngohRmHg&t=718) Massed Compute instructions and RunPod instructions&nbsp; and the installers. Just read these files, apply&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwMngohRmHg&t=725) the commands here and it will work. If you cannot&nbsp; make it, I already have a tutorial video starting&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwMngohRmHg&t=731) from 12:56. So watch it and you will understand&nbsp; how to run these scripts. And now on Massed Compute,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwMngohRmHg&t=738) we are supporting all of the GPUs with our coupon.&nbsp; I recommend to use RTX A6000 ADA. This is a very&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwMngohRmHg&t=746) powerful GPU. You will get same speed as on my&nbsp; RTX 5090. You can also use H100 with an amazing&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwMngohRmHg&t=753) price of $1.76 per hour. You can also use A100.&nbsp; It is $1.16 per hour. I mean, the deal is just&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwMngohRmHg&t=763) amazing right now with the Massed Compute, so that&nbsp; is my favorite. I recommend you. Also, we have&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwMngohRmHg&t=769) RunPod instructions. With the RunPod, what is very&nbsp; important is that this RunPod PyTorch version,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwMngohRmHg&t=775) this template, so select it, then just run these&nbsp; commands and it will work. I also have tutorials&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwMngohRmHg&t=780) for RunPod if you don't know how to use it, just&nbsp; watch them and you will learn. You can use any GPU&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwMngohRmHg&t=785) on RunPod. So this is it. I hope you have enjoyed.&nbsp; And hopefully, I will upgrade this application,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwMngohRmHg&t=792) make it way better, add many more features such&nbsp; as batch processing of folders. If possible,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwMngohRmHg&t=797) setting the resolution and number of generations.&nbsp; I don't know, you can tell me your requests. I&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwMngohRmHg&t=803) will try to implement all of them. You know our Wan&nbsp; 2.1 application has so many features like presets&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwMngohRmHg&t=809) and other stuff. Hopefully, I will add similar&nbsp; stuff to here. Let me show you the latest version&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwMngohRmHg&t=814) of the Wan 2.1 application. So you will understand&nbsp; what kind of features we can get. And I am also&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwMngohRmHg&t=819) working on improved SUPIR application. This is&nbsp; the very best image upscaling application. I will&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwMngohRmHg&t=825) make a video for it soon, the newest version. You&nbsp; will love it. So this is our Wan 2.1 application.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwMngohRmHg&t=831) We have so many features here. Hopefully, I will&nbsp; add some of the features we have here to this new&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwMngohRmHg&t=838) application that I have just published today for&nbsp; you guys. So you can download from here and you&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwMngohRmHg&t=844) can download from here in the next latents.&nbsp; Thank you so much. Hopefully see you later.
