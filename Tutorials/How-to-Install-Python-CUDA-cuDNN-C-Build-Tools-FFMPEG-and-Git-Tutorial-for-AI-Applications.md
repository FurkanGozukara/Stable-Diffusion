### Video Transcription


- [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=0) Greetings everyone. I did a fresh install of&nbsp; Windows 11 and I am going to set it up for Python&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=7) and AI applications. So in this video, I will&nbsp; show how to install Python 3.10 and Python 3.11,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=15) CUDA 11.8 and CUDA 12.4, cuDNN version 9.4, C++&nbsp; tools, Microsoft Visual Studio, and FFMPEG. These&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=28) are the applications that you need to run all&nbsp; of the open source AI applications. Moreover,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=34) I will show how to install and run LivePortrait&nbsp; including animal version and FaceFusion3. These&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=42) are the hardest to install and run two open source&nbsp; applications. So after watching this tutorial,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=48) you will know everything. Okay guys, this is&nbsp; a hack to the workflow of the tutorial. I am&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=54) recording this part after the entire tutorial&nbsp; has been completed. You will see in the tutorial&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=60) that I have installed cuDNN 9.4. However, it is&nbsp; still not appropriate for the majority of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=67) applications. It is only used in FaceFusion&nbsp; so far. So I suggest you use cuDNN 8.9 as a&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=76) default version. CUDA 12.4 should work in all&nbsp; cases. When you watch the entire tutorial,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=81) you will know it. Also, when installing C++&nbsp; tools, select Windows SDK as well. Otherwise,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=88) you will get an error as I have shown in the&nbsp; tutorial. Moreover, I have added quick download&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=93) links for cuDNN DLL files. Moreover, the&nbsp; tutorial will have full video chapters. So look&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=100) at the video description and jump to the video&nbsp; chapter that you are looking for information. So&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=106) keep watching. Please watch the entire tutorial.&nbsp; This is a gold tutorial. You will understand a&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=112) lot of problems that you have encountered or you&nbsp; might encounter in future. So enjoy the tutorial.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=120) First of all, let me show you that I don't have&nbsp; anything installed yet. When I type python,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=125) you will see that it is opening this window. By&nbsp; the way, some people are installing from here.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=130) That is a huge mistake. First of all, uninstall&nbsp; all of the Pythons if you have anything. Then&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=136) if I type FFMPEG, you see that I don't have&nbsp; any FFMPEG. If I type nvcc --version, I don't&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=143) have any CUDA installed and I don't have any C++&nbsp; tools installed. So first of all, let's begin with&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=150) installing Python 3.10.11. Python versions&nbsp; are extremely important. If an application is&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=157) developed on Python 3.10, if you install Python&nbsp; 3.11 or 12, it will not work. So first of all,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=163) let's download the Windows installer 64-bit from&nbsp; here. Then start it with double click. From here,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=170) select add Python.exe to PATH. Customize&nbsp; installation. This is important. Select&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=175) everything from here. Next. Select everything&nbsp; here. However, do not install into here. I&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=181) installed into C drive directly like this 3.10 and&nbsp; install. It will ask you to verify. Click yes. And&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=189) it will start the installation. So this is how you&nbsp; install Python 3.10.11. Once this is completed,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=196) I will install Python 3.11, not 3.10. And then I&nbsp; will show how to switch between each one of them.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=204) So you can use both of them. Have both of them and&nbsp; make one of them default whenever you are using.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=211) Okay. It is asking me to disable path length. This&nbsp; is important. Disable path length. It will ask you&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=216) permission. Click yes. And it is set up and it&nbsp; is completed. Now, if I start a new CMD window&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=224) and type Python, I should get Python 3.10.11. You&nbsp; see here. Okay, now I am going to install Python&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=232) 3.11. Why? Because some applications are moving&nbsp; slowly to Python 3.11. Therefore, you should know&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=240) how to use them both. My automatic installers&nbsp; will generate accordingly to the requirements&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=247) Python 3.10 or Python 3.11 by using the Python&nbsp; launcher. So when you have both of them installed,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=253) it will work. Click here. Windows installer 64&nbsp; bit. Double click and start installation. Now&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=260) you see there is add Python.exe to PATH. I will&nbsp; add it. Customize installation. Select everything.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=265) You see py launcher. This is actually the thing&nbsp; that allows me to programmatically select accurate&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=272) Python version when I am making an installer for&nbsp; you. Then click next. Install everything. Then&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=278) install it into C:\Python311. Install. It will ask&nbsp; you permission. Click yes. Please install Python&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=284) into your C drive. It is the best location to&nbsp; install them. Okay, you see setup was successful&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=290) and close. Now if I open a CMD window and type&nbsp; Python, it will be 3.11. However, I don't suggest&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=298) you to make default version 3.11 because many of&nbsp; the open source AI applications are still working&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=305) with 3.10. So how we are going to set the 3.10&nbsp; as default. Open environment variables. You see&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=312) I type env and the edit system environment&nbsp; variables appear. Open it. Then in here click&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=318) the environment variables. In here you see user&nbsp; variables for Furkan my username and PATH. Click&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=324) edit. You see there is only this application. And&nbsp; then there is also system variables. Click edit.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=329) And you see Python applications are added&nbsp; here. So if it were inside the user variables,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=336) I would replace that. However, since it is inside&nbsp; the system variables, then I am going to change&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=341) here. What you need to change is move this to&nbsp; the top like this and like this. So this system&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=347) environment variables are read from top to the&nbsp; bottom. Since they are here. Now it will use this&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=353) one first. So Python 3.10 will be my default.&nbsp; Okay. And okay. When you change back the order,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=361) it will change the default. Whenever you make&nbsp; such changes, you need to start another CMD&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=366) window and type Python. And you see now&nbsp; 3.10.11 is my default version. However,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=372) I have both of them in my system. Okay. As a&nbsp; next step, we are going to install Microsoft&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=377) Visual Studio. You see the Microsoft Visual Studio&nbsp; download link is here. This is important because&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=382) some of the libraries are compiled on system. Why?&nbsp; Because they don't have a pre-compiled wheels.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=390) Therefore, our system has to compile them.&nbsp; There is free version of Visual Studio, which&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=395) is community edition. Free download here. The&nbsp; link was here. I click it from here. By the way,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=399) the link of this post will be in the description&nbsp; of the video and also in the comment section of&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=403) the video. So check that video description. So&nbsp; the installer is downloaded. I will right click&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=409) and start this as an administrator. It will ask&nbsp; you permission. Click yes. Then click continue.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=415) Okay. The installation interface started. So what&nbsp; you need to install for Python and open source AI&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=421) applications is desktop development with C++. From&nbsp; here, select everything. But what you don't need&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=428) to select is only the Windows SDK. So don't&nbsp; select them. Select everything from here like&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=435) this. Select install while downloading. So it will&nbsp; download into the C. If you have another disk that&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=442) you have space, you can change the location of&nbsp; install. But I am leaving it as it is like this&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=447) as default. Okay. Install while downloading. It&nbsp; is still installing. However, I want to mention&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=452) something. If you don't know how to uninstall your&nbsp; previously installed Python or other applications.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=459) Type add to the search bar and you will see&nbsp; add or remove programs. When you open here,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=464) you will see which applications there are and&nbsp; you can uninstall. So in here, you see it shows&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=470) my Python installations. I can click these three&nbsp; dots and uninstall them. To follow this tutorial,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=476) you should uninstall them. It will help you then&nbsp; make a fresh installation into the C drive as I&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=482) have shown. Okay. So the installation of Visual&nbsp; Studio has been completed. Click skip this for&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=488) now. And you can start a Visual Studio like this.&nbsp; Let's start one. And that's it. Okay. Let's close&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=495) this. Now as a next step, I am going to download&nbsp; CUDA 11.8 and 12.4. I will have both of them,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=504) but I will make one of them default. So let's&nbsp; go to the 11.8 first from here. Then click&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=511) Windows and Windows 11 local .exe. Okay.&nbsp; Download this. It's three gigabytes. Let's&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=517) also download the other one at the same time.&nbsp; So 12.4 windows and 11. If you are Windows 10,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=525) download the Windows 10 from here. Okay. Getting&nbsp; downloaded. Okay. Let's begin with installing CUDA&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=531) 11.8. It is here. Double click it. Alternatively,&nbsp; you can click and hit enter as well. It will ask&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=537) you permission. Click yes. Then it will first&nbsp; extract it into this temporary file. If you want&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=544) to delete this later, you can change this path.&nbsp; And like here, let's say C. This is not mandatory,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=551) but let's say C:\CUDA_temp. Okay. It will&nbsp; extract there. Then it will start installation.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=558) If you have WinRAR, you can also right click and&nbsp; use WinRAR to extract and then later delete it.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=564) I will install the CUDA 12.4 with that way. Okay.&nbsp; Here agree and continue. Select custom. Then you&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=571) can select which one of them you want to install.&nbsp; I don't want NVIDIA GeForce experience. So select&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=576) CUDA other components and driver components.&nbsp; Click next. You see, this is the location that&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=581) it is going to install. So let's click next. They&nbsp; are default and it will start the installation.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=587) You see, it is also setting configuring visual&nbsp; studio settings. That is why first I installed&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=593) the Visual Studio. Then I am installing the&nbsp; CUDA. The order can also make impact. Moreover,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=599) close all of the Visual Studio before installing&nbsp; the CUDA. So there won't be any issues. Okay. At&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=605) the end, it gives a summary installed Nsight for&nbsp; Visual Studio 2022, which we installed and Nsight&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=613) monitor. Not installed for Visual Studio 2019,&nbsp; which we don't have and the Visual Studio 2017. So&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=621) here the results then click next. And it shows the&nbsp; installed other things components here. Then click&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=627) close. Then how you can test it is installed&nbsp; or not open a new command line. Whenever you&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=633) install something, you need to open a new command&nbsp; line interface as CMD. Then type nvcc --version.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=641) So it will show you the currently installed and&nbsp; default CUDA version. Now let's install CUDA 12.4.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=649) So for this, I will right click WinRAR and extract&nbsp; CUDA 12.4. This is not mandatory. But as I said,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=656) if you have WinRAR, you can use this. I&nbsp; really like WinRAR from RARLab. Okay. It&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=661) is extracted. Then enter inside it. And here you&nbsp; will see setup exe. Double click it. It will ask you&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=667) permission. Click yes. So it is also doing some&nbsp; system compatibility checkup like the CUDA 11.8.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=673) Agree and continue. Select custom. I don't like&nbsp; NVIDIA GeForce experience. So I uncheck it next.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=680) This is where it will be installed next. And it&nbsp; says that the following environment variables will&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=685) be updated to current installation. You see now&nbsp; my CUDA path will become by default 12.4. However,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=694) don't worry. After this, I will show how to change&nbsp; it. Click next. So it is going to install. Okay.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=699) It is installing. Okay. So the installation has&nbsp; been completed. Click next and close. Now let's&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=704) open another CMD window and type nvcc --version.&nbsp; And you see now the default CUDA version is 12.4.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=713) So how you can return back the CUDA 11.8 for any&nbsp; reason. Again, we open the edit system environment&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=720) variables. Then click environment variables.&nbsp; And let's see if it is in the user path. No,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=725) not here. Then when we look at the bottom, we&nbsp; can see that it is in the system variables. So&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=730) you see CUDA path is set as like this one 12.4.&nbsp; And also there is path here. When I edit it,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=737) you see CUDA 12.4 is at the top. So if I&nbsp; move this to the top like this and like this,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=745) it will become default 11.8. Make it like this.&nbsp; Then also change the default CUDA path 11.8. So I&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=753) copy this. Move here. Change this. You see now my&nbsp; default CUDA will be 11.8. Click OK. Click OK. Now&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=761) when I open a new CMD and type nvcc --version,&nbsp; you see now my default is 11.8. However,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=768) I am going to move to the 12.4 from this moment&nbsp; because newer applications are going to use 12.4.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=776) So let's return back to environment and set&nbsp; it back as before. So I copy this. You really&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=783) should learn how to change system environment&nbsp; variables because you may be needed to for other&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=788) applications as well. Then let's go to the path&nbsp; here. Edit it and move this to the top and this to&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=795) the top. OK. OK. OK. Then open a new CMD and nvcc&nbsp; --version and it is done. So let's return back to&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=804) our post. This post is public. So you can follow&nbsp; this tutorial without any paywalled necessary thing.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=811) OK. Let's download FFMPEG. Go to the FFMPEG here.&nbsp; There are releases. Some applications sometimes&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=818) not working with the latest version. It is hard&nbsp; to know which version will work. So you can try&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=825) different versions. But for now I will use the&nbsp; latest. So which one is the latest? You see&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=831) this is the latest version. FFMPEG master latest&nbsp; win64gpl.zip file. They have so many versions

- [00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=839) n7, n6.1, n5.1. So if the application doesn't&nbsp; work with latest, you can make others default. OK.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=847) Let's download this. So this is for Windows. Open&nbsp; it. Then extract it here. I will use extract all.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=854) Extract all here. OK. Then enter inside it. Enter&nbsp; inside binary. These are the files that you need.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=861) Cut them from here. Let's cut. Let's go back to&nbsp; the C drive. And let's generate a new folder as&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=868) FFMPEG. Actually I have something. Yeah. Let's&nbsp; delete both of them. Let's say FFMPEG_latest&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=875) like this. And move the files there. Are you&nbsp; done? No. Copy the path of this like here. Or&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=881) you can use the folder pick as well. Open&nbsp; environment. Environment variables. And in&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=887) here you can either use user variables or system&nbsp; variables. Let's use the user variables. Edit.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=893) This will only valid for this user. If you have&nbsp; other users, it will not work. So if you make&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=898) it system variables, it will work for all users&nbsp; like administrator, like yours. Let's add it to the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=903) system variables. Click new. Then click browse.&nbsp; Then select the folder you have just generated,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=911) which is FFMPEG_latest. So you see it is added&nbsp; like this. You can also manually add too. If you&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=917) have other FFMPEG folders, the first one, the&nbsp; one at the top will work. Okay. Okay. And okay.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=924) Then lets open a new CMD and type ffmpeg and it will show you the FFMPEG version that you have. Ok.

- [00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=932) Now I can see. This is my latest FFMPEG version&nbsp; built with gcc 14.2 and other stuff. It supports&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=940) all these libraries. So this is how you install&nbsp; latest best FFMPEG version. Why FFMPEG is really&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=948) important because in many applications there&nbsp; will be video processing and you need FFMPEG to&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=954) make them work. Okay. Then as a next step, we are&nbsp; going to install cuDNN because some applications&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=960) requires latest cuDNN files. So I am going to&nbsp; download the latest from here. There is also&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=966) archive of cuDNN. You can see older cuDNN files&nbsp; here. I'm going to download cuDNN 9.4 Windows&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=973) this and then 10 and .exe local. Then download&nbsp; it. Okay. The download has been completed. You&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=979) can also extract this with WinRAR from here or&nbsp; double click and run it. So let's double click&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=984) and run it. It will ask you permission. Click&nbsp; yes. So it is going to extract it here. Let's&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=989) extract into c:\cudnn. I can later delete it. Then it&nbsp; will start installation. Agree and continue. Click&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=995) custom. You see it is going to install cuDNN for&nbsp; CUDA 12.6 and CUDA 11.8. So in either CUDA version&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=1005) it will work. I think it should support CUDA 12.4&nbsp; too. I'm not sure. Let's install. Okay. cuDNN 9.4&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=1014) and next. And it is installed. Let's open the&nbsp; environment variables. Go to the environment and&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=1019) see if it is added anywhere. Let's go to the path&nbsp; variable. And yes, you see cuDNN 9.4 is added to&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=1028) the very top of the system. So if you need other&nbsp; ones, you can download them here. You see it also&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=1034) shows CUDA 12.x, which means that it works with&nbsp; all of the CUDA 12.x versions. Now what else is&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=1041) left? We also need to install C++ tools. This is&nbsp; one of the most problematic ones. There is a huge&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=1049) amount of explanation here. I am going to install&nbsp; latest. I'm going to install latest LTSC 17.8,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=1057) which supports both CUDA 11.8 and CUDA 12.4. So&nbsp; to download the latest, go here. And in here,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=1065) look for this version. Let's look at it, which is&nbsp; LTSC 17.8. You see the last one is July 8 version.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=1074) Are there any other one? There is also September&nbsp; one. This one. So let's download the September&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=1079) one. For this to download, we need to download&nbsp; which version, which is Build Tools. Okay,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=1085) click it. I also have some quick download links&nbsp; here. You can also use them. Then open the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=1091) downloaded version. It will ask permission. Click&nbsp; yes. And click continue. So we are downloading the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=1098) LTSC 17.8 September build. This one 17.8.14.&nbsp; This supports both CUDA 11.8 and 12.4. I also&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=1108) added some reading articles. So here you can&nbsp; read them to learn more about C++ tools. Okay,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=1114) it disappeared from my system. So I will rerun it&nbsp; for some reason. Extracting. Okay, continue. Okay,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=1122) it failed for some reason. Okay, here. It says&nbsp; that I already have installer started. So you&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=1127) need to close all of the installers you have.&nbsp; Let's close this first. Then start again. Pay&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=1132) attention to that. Click yes. And click continue.&nbsp; So if you have any opened Visual Studio installer,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=1137) it will not work. In worst case, you can&nbsp; restart your computer and be sure of that. Okay,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=1142) now here what we are going to install is C++ Tools&nbsp; Desktop Development. You see, and if you already&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=1148) have installed once you need to delete them. Let's&nbsp; see if we have any installed components. It shows.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=1155) Okay, I think it was showing somewhere here. Yeah,&nbsp; you see, we don't have any C++ tools. Therefore,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=1161) we are good to install. So let's close this and&nbsp; start it again. Okay, Visual Studio installer. You&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=1167) see, this one has Build Tools. And when you pay&nbsp; attention, you will see installing Visual Studio&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=1172) Build Tools. This is not Visual Studio itself.&nbsp; This is Build Tools. Select C++ and from here&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=1179) select everything. So this is also going to take&nbsp; a lot of space. If you don't have a lot of space,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=1183) you can just change the installation location&nbsp; from here. But I have. So I selected everything&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=1190) and install. And this time it is going to install&nbsp; Visual Studio Build Tools. When you install both&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=1195) of these, then you are all set to work with the&nbsp; open source AI. You don't need to install these&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=1202) two into your C drive. But I prefer to install&nbsp; into C drive to not have any issues, any possible&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=1208) issues. So this is the way of installing C++&nbsp; tools. And you can see which one is installed.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=1213) Visual Studio build tools 2022 LTSC 17.8. And&nbsp; the installation has been completed as you are&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=1221) seeing right now. Visual Studio Build Tools.&nbsp; All right. What is left? Let's close this. The&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=1226) only left thing is Git. Why Git? Git is used to&nbsp; clone remote repositories. So we need it. You see,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=1233) this is the latest Git. So let's download Windows&nbsp; from here. 64 bit. Let's download it. And then&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=1240) let's run it. Click yes. It will ask permission.&nbsp; Click next. This is where it installs. Okay. You&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=1245) don't need to change anything. I will just click&nbsp; next, next, next, next, next. Nothing else. Just&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=1251) do everything next. It asks so many things, but&nbsp; just next to everything. This is super important.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=1257) If you don't install Git, your installations will&nbsp; fail. Okay. Then finish. Then start a new CMD and&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=1264) type Git. And you should see this message. You&nbsp; see, it shows that we already have Git installed&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=1269) and set up. Okay. Now we have everything for&nbsp; running all of the open source AI applications.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=1276) Everything is set up. Perfectly fine. Perfectly&nbsp; accurate. Of course, I assume you have installed&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=1281) the NVIDIA latest drivers. So what we are going&nbsp; to do now is testing installation of LivePortrait&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=1289) and Face Fusion. So let's begin with the&nbsp; LivePortrait. Okay. So to install LivePortrait,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=1295) let's go to the Patreon exclusive post index.&nbsp; And in here, let's search for LivePortrait. And&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=1301) it is here. Let's open it. And at the bottom of my&nbsp; sharing, you will see the attachments. I suggest&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=1307) you to download them from here. Let's download the&nbsp; latest version. Then I suggest you to install them&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=1313) into directly a drive, a hard drive, not into the&nbsp; subfolders. So let's extract it here into C drive.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=1320) Right click extract all extract into the folder.&nbsp; You can also install other disks. So you see,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=1326) this is my path. You shouldn't have any space&nbsp; character or non-English characters letters in&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=1332) your paths. You see, this is a perfect path. It's&nbsp; a short one. C:\LivePortrait_version6. Then all&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=1338) you need to do is for installing double click&nbsp; install.bat file. It may ask you to allow. So&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=1345) click more info and run anyway, but don't worry.&nbsp; You can always right click and edit it to see its&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=1352) content. You can edit in notepad. You can edit&nbsp; it in Notepad++ or anything that you wish and&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=1358) see everything. Everything that I install is&nbsp; 100% transparent. You can see what is getting&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=1364) installed. You can see all the files, use them,&nbsp; look at them. So I don't distribute any exes

- [00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=1370) or any such thing. Everything is usually Python&nbsp; code from open source repositories. So everything&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=1376) is 100% safe. Follow the CMD window carefully to&nbsp; see what is happening. So you see it cloned the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=1382) repository generated a virtual environment. All&nbsp; of my scripts generates a virtual environment like&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=1388) here. So everything installed will be isolated&nbsp; in here. It will not impact or affect anything on&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=1395) your computer. They will be fully isolated here.&nbsp; So it is installing the necessary libraries like&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=1401) now fully automatically. It will also download&nbsp; the necessary models automatically. So you don't&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=1405) need to do anything yourself manually. During&nbsp; the installation or anything running on CMD. If&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=1412) you touch the CMD window, it may freeze. Just hit&nbsp; enter in that case for it to continue. You see it&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=1418) is installing everything. I don't see any errors&nbsp; so far. It is downloading the necessary models&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=1423) automatically. Okay. After download complete&nbsp; message, it will start compiling XPose. It may&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=1429) take a while patiently wait. Compiling this is the&nbsp; most important part. The hardest part. However,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=1436) you see it is using CUDA 12.4 which we installed&nbsp; and the C++ tools. It is compiling it. By the way,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=1444) when you install something, right click here and&nbsp; export text. So you can save this text file and&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=1452) send me if there is an error. So I can look at&nbsp; your installation logs and see the error reason.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=1459) We can see processing dependencies. All is done.&nbsp; Now you see it shows virtual environment made and&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=1465) installed properly. Time to start the application.&nbsp; Let's close this. And let's windows_startup.bat&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=1470) file. Run anyway. And human LivePortrait or animal&nbsp; LivePortrait. Let's try the human LivePortrait&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=1477) first. So click one. And it's starting human&nbsp; LivePortrait. Just wait patiently here. Okay. It's&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=1483) starting. Okay. This time we got an error related&nbsp; to cuDNN. I think. Because it shows that CUDA path&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=1491) is set but CUDA wasn't able to be loaded. So let's&nbsp; download older version of cuDNN. To download it.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=1499) Let's go to the cuDNN archive. And let's download&nbsp; this one. 8.9.7. So there is windows zip file.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=1508) Let's download it. Okay. This is asking login.&nbsp; And from here. You can login or sign up. So when&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=1514) you type your email. If you don't have an account,&nbsp; it will ask you to sign up. If you have account,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=1521) it will ask you to enter your password and login.&nbsp; And just wait for login. Okay. It is asking me to&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=1528) verify my email. So I will click verify my email&nbsp; address. Authentication was successful. And yes.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=1535) Now I am redirecting back. These are one time&nbsp; things that you need to do. And it is downloading&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=1540) right now as you are seeing. Okay. Let's close&nbsp; this error. And let's open. Let's extract here.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=1547) And cuDNN files are here. Okay. So what you need&nbsp; to do is now you need to add this as a path to the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=1555) system environment variables. It didn't give us&nbsp; installer like the latest version. Let's see if&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=1562) there's an installer for this. This is for CUDA&nbsp; 12.x. Okay. There are local installer for Linux,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=1569) but there is no Windows installer. Okay. So it&nbsp; is fine. How are we going to do it? We already&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=1574) know. So let's cut this all. Okay. Then go to&nbsp; the C drive and make a new folder like cuDNN&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=1580) 8.9. Okay. Like this. Let's enter inside it. Copy&nbsp; paste them here. Copy the path. Open environment&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=1586) variables and environment variables. And in here&nbsp; go to the path and make a new folder. Copy paste&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=1594) the path or you can select move this to the&nbsp; very top. You see this has to be above the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=1600) other cuDNN. Otherwise it will try to use this&nbsp; one. So okay. Okay. And okay. Let's return back&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=1606) to our installation. LivePortrait and let's start&nbsp; the application. Let's start human LivePortrait.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=1613) Okay. It is loading everything. These are&nbsp; hardest to make install and run applications.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=1618) The other AI applications are much more easier&nbsp; and convenient to use. And it is started. So you&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=1625) see in this video, I show you everything. I show&nbsp; you how to solve your problems. I show you how to&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=1631) properly install. Let's make an experiment.&nbsp; Let's select this as an example. And let's&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=1636) use this as an example. Okay. Then let's animate.&nbsp; You can follow the progress here. If you get this&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=1643) connection reset error. It's not important.&nbsp; It is related to gradio interface. And yes,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=1648) it is making right now. And another thing that&nbsp; I'm going to show you is. nvitop. So pip install&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=1655) nvitop. You can install this system wide. It's&nbsp; fine. Then this requires Python 3.10. I don't know&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=1661) if 11 working. nvitop. Type like this. And you&nbsp; will see that which GPUs are being used how much.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=1668) So this is my main GPU. And this is my second GPU.&nbsp; On the second GPU. I run the OBS studio to record&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=1675) audio and the video. And on the first GPU, it is&nbsp; running the LivePortrait. You see it is animating&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=1680) right now. It is pretty fast. And it is not using&nbsp; much VRAM as you are seeing right now. But another&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=1685) application may require cuDNN 9.4 instead&nbsp; of the 8.9. So if you encounter such error,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=1693) you know what to do. Just make the cuDNN 9.4 as&nbsp; default. And it will work. So you really need&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=1699) to understand the logic here. Because the logic&nbsp; matters. Currently we need cuDNN 8.9. I am also&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=1706) going to update these links. So you will be able&nbsp; to download and install cuDNN 8.9 immediately.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=1713) Without spending time. But you can also download&nbsp; from the official websites. So don't worry about&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=1718) that. And the animation generated. Let's see it.&nbsp; I will open the desktop audio as well. Okay. So it&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=1728) is working. I am not going to show a lot. Because&nbsp; of the copyright issues. So it is working. Now&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=1733) let's run the animal version. Okay. To run the&nbsp; animal version. I am going to close this human&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=1738) version. And Windows start application. And animal&nbsp; LivePortrait here. And it is started successfully.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=1745) Let's animate this one. This is a cute cat. And&nbsp; from here select driving video. Let's use this one&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=1751) for example. Okay. Then click animate. Always&nbsp; watch CMD window to see what is happening. So&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=1758) you see it started animating. If I were lacking&nbsp; FFMPEG. The final video wouldn't be generated.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=1764) However since I have FFMPEG. It is working. And&nbsp; it is also running right now. Animating the video.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=1770) And the animation has been completed. You see the&nbsp; animated GIF image is here. Let me play the video&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=1776) for a while. Okay. As you are seeing it is fully&nbsp; working. I am not going to play the entire audio.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=1785) Because of the copyright issues. But you see it&nbsp; is working perfectly fine. Now as a last step.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=1791) We are going to install the FaceFusion 3. Which&nbsp; is another hardest one. Let's go to the Patreon&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=1798) exclusive index. And let's look for FaceFusion&nbsp; here. Okay. FaceFusion 3. Let's go to it. And&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=1803) let's download it. Okay. Let's also install it&nbsp; into our C drive. Paste it. Continue. And. And&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=1811) extract to here. Extract all FaceFusion 3.1. And&nbsp; extract it. Now. Click windows_install.bat file.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=1819) More info run anyway. It will always install&nbsp; the latest FaceFusion into your computer. Okay.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=1826) Error somewhere. Says. Wait. Okay. For some reason&nbsp; cloning has failed. Therefore currently it is not&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=1834) accurately installed. So I am going to close this&nbsp; window. It may happen due to maybe my antivirus.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=1839) So I will delete this virtual environment. Okay.&nbsp; Let's delete it. This is important. Pay attention.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=1844) Then click windows install again. Let's see.&nbsp; Yes. Okay. It says that it cannot find the git&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=1851) in my system for some reason. So let's find out&nbsp; the reason. So it says Git&nbsp;is not recognized as&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=1857) an internal external command. It is meaning we&nbsp; have an error. Let's open cmd again and let's&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=1863) type Git. And yes. Even though we installed Git.&nbsp; It is not visible right now for some reason. So&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=1869) let's look at the environment variables. And&nbsp; let's see if we broken anything. Let's open&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=1875) the path. Okay. It doesn't show Git here for some&nbsp; reason. Maybe we overwritten. So what I am going&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=1881) to do is simply I will reinstall the Git from&nbsp; here. Yes. Okay. Let's see. I don't know why it&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=1888) happened. Never has happened to me before.&nbsp; But if Git get lost like this, you need to&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=1894) reinstall. Okay. It is reinstalling right now.&nbsp; Okay. Reinstalled. Let's open Git again. Yes.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=1899) The git has arrived. Wow. This is weird. How&nbsp; did it happen? Maybe my antivirus. Let's look&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=1905) at the path and see if git is here. Yes. The&nbsp; git is here. Maybe we deleted it accidentally,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=1912) but you need to see the git cmd as here in the&nbsp; path. Okay. So let's close. Maybe we overridden&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=1918) it inaccurately somehow while we were working&nbsp; on. So it may happen. Okay. Let's return back to&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=1924) FaceFusion. Let's delete the virtual environment&nbsp; and let's click the windows install again. Okay.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=1929) You see it is cloning into FaceFusion. You&nbsp; need to see this. Otherwise it will not work.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=1935) Okay. Clone has been completed. It generated&nbsp; a virtual environment as supposed to be. Now&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=1939) it will install everything for us automatically.&nbsp; Okay. So the installation of FaceFusion has been&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=1945) completed. Let's close it. You see, press any key&nbsp; to continue. And then windows_startup.bat file,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=1952) then run anyway. And it is starting. Select&nbsp; CUDA using CUDA execution provider. You see,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=1958) I also have example face and video. We are going&nbsp; to use them as a test. Make sure that you first&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=1964) test on the example. Then you can use your own&nbsp; videos. We can also monitor the GPU usage. Okay.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=1971) It's starting. It is downloading necessary new&nbsp; models. When you do first time start. So if one of&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=1977) the download fails, close and start again until it&nbsp; fixes all of them. Okay. All models downloaded and&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=1984) the application started. You need to click this&nbsp; link to open. So just select it. Cannot click it.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=1990) So I'm going to type it. It is here. Like this.&nbsp; You see. Okay. Interface started. Let's test&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=1996) with demo material first. I have demo material&nbsp; automatically downloaded. You can see example.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=2002) Let's select this face. And then let's select a&nbsp; target video. And it should appear here. Always&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=2008) pay attention to the CMD. And we got errors.&nbsp; These errors happens when these DLL files are not&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=2015) automatically downloaded for any reason. Currently&nbsp; Windows 11 blocking to auto download them. So&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=2021) which files are these? These are cuDNN 9.4. So&nbsp; let's close this CMD and go back to your cuDNN&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=2028) 9.4 installation. You see it is. It was here.&nbsp; cuDNN 9.4 binary. So let's copy all of them from&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=2036) here. And where you need to put them. You need to&nbsp; put them inside FaceFusion folder. By the way, I&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=2042) added a txt file. So it also shows the path where&nbsp; you need to put them. Enter inside FaceFusion.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=2048) Enter inside virtual environment. And library,&nbsp; site packages. And in here. Find onnxruntime.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=2056) Here. And copy. You need to put all of them here&nbsp; like this. Also making cuDNN 9.4 default may fix&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=2064) this issue. But I think this is better way. You&nbsp; see one application requires cuDNN 8.9. Other&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=2070) one requiring 9.4. So there is no one for all&nbsp; solution. Then let's start the application again.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=2077) And let's hit one. So if you get that error, you&nbsp; need to do this. Okay. Let's refresh. Let's select&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=2084) the face again. And let's select the video file.&nbsp; And let's look at the CMD window. Yes. No errors.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=2092) So it is working perfectly fine. Then let's start&nbsp; and see the progress speed. We can see it here.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=2098) It is using CUDA. Yes. It is working without any&nbsp; errors. And you see it is processing 10 frames,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=2104) 12 frames per second. So this is how you solve&nbsp; C++ related errors. cuDNN related errors. Okay. So&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=2112) that's it. The video is generated. I done my share&nbsp; boot up there. If you engage in what the federal&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=2117) government calls illegal. So you see this was&nbsp; the default values generation. It was really,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=2123) really fast. It took less than one minute for&nbsp; this 21 seconds video with all the default&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrhUHnYfwC0&t=2129) options. I hope you have enjoyed. Please like,&nbsp; subscribe. Also, if you support me on Patreon,&nbsp;&nbsp;
