### Video Transcription


- [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=0) Greetings everyone. Today I am going to show you&nbsp; three new presets that I have prepared. The first&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=5) one is increasing the realism of Qwen image&nbsp; models. If you remember, this was the result&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=12) that we were getting after training our model. Now&nbsp; with this preset, we are going to get this result.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=18) When you look at the images, you can see how much&nbsp; it is increasing the realism without losing the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=26) complexity and features of the prompt. You see,&nbsp; this is a very hard prompt, and if you need more&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=31) realism, you can even increase the new LoRA weight&nbsp; that we are going to use, a realism LoRA, and get&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=38) a more realistic image like this one. For example,&nbsp; this was the base image we were getting. Now with&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=43) the new LoRA, we are going to get this image. Here&nbsp; another case, base image, and with the new preset,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=48) we get this. Another example, base image, with&nbsp; the new preset we are going to get this, and if we&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=54) increase further, we are going to get this. This&nbsp; is a good example, base image, with the new preset&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=59) we are going to get this image, and we can even&nbsp; further increase the realism like this. Remember,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=64) these are all hard prompts, not a prompt that you&nbsp; generate a close shot of a face. From this base&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=70) image into this realistic image, or even further&nbsp; into this image. Another case, from this image&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=76) into this image or this image. Another case, from&nbsp; this image into this image or this image. You will&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=84) see that it is hugely improving the realism of the&nbsp; images. From this base image into this image or&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=91) this image, it will look much better. For example,&nbsp; from this image into this one. For example,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=97) from this base image into this image. I mean, look&nbsp; at the realism that we are getting. From this into&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=102) this, this is a very, very realistic image. Or&nbsp; you can even further increase the realism like&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=108) this one. And pay attention, we are still keeping&nbsp; the image as it is. We are just increasing the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=114) realism. This is really, really good. I did&nbsp; a huge amount of tests and experimentation&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=120) to come up with this workflow. With just the&nbsp; addition of a LoRA with the proper settings,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=125) you are going to increase the realism. By the&nbsp; way, these are just grid images. These are not&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=130) cherry-picks. Therefore, these are not perfect,&nbsp; but understand that you are going to get a huge&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=134) realism boost with this workflow. Or from this&nbsp; image into this one, I mean look at the realism&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=140) that we are going to get or this one. Here another&nbsp; case from this one into this one or into this one.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=146) Here another case from this image into this one&nbsp; or into this one. Or another case from this image&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=152) into this one or into this one. So you can get&nbsp; a huge amount of realism with our new preset.

- [00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=157) This preset will not only work on trained models.&nbsp; This was the base generation of the Qwen model,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=163) and with using this new preset, you&nbsp; can get up to this realism. I mean,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=168) from this base image into this image, this is&nbsp; a huge boost of realism for this model. It is&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=175) not perfect, but Qwen can do very hard&nbsp; prompts very beautifully. So therefore,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=180) this model has huge amount of potential with this&nbsp; realism LoRA that we are going to have. And this&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=185) LoRA doesn't only increase the realism of the&nbsp; fantastic prompts. This is like a studio shot,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=192) and you can increase your studio shot realism&nbsp; like this case as well. Here another case,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=197) this is a base image, and this is with the realism&nbsp; LoRA. And even further, you can get to this.

- [00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=202) Another thing that I'm going to show you is&nbsp; how to do inpainting on massive images really&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=209) fast and really quickly. So we will just&nbsp; inpaint the head like, mask it like this,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=215) and only that area will be generated by the model&nbsp; so easily, so well. You will see it. You see,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=221) we will be improving our images significantly from&nbsp; this face to this face. I will show everything.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=228) Furthermore, I am also going to show you how to&nbsp; outpaint images with an updated workflow that&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=235) works amazing. You see, this is a massive outpaint&nbsp; from this input image into this output image. It&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=243) is almost perfect. I will show even outpainting&nbsp; the entire image from all sides. You see from&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=250) 1328 into 1536. We will be able to outpaint&nbsp; massively even big images at once like this.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=258) So keep watching to learn all. Moreover, you will&nbsp; be able to fix only certain parts of the images,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=264) like removing this annoying text. You see the&nbsp; text is gone fully. It is looking perfect. With&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=271) just inpainting this area of the image,&nbsp; it will be super fast, super accurate.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=276) It is not going to change any other area of&nbsp; the image, just the masked area of the image&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=282) will be changed. So today, I will show both&nbsp; realism and inpainting in SwarmUI very easily.

- [00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=289) And we have another preset, ultra realism. This&nbsp; preset will work only on realistic prompts. From&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=296) this image into this image. This preset will&nbsp; make the model to lose its fantastic prompt&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=302) capability. You see this is the base generation&nbsp; and this is the ultra-realistic generation. So&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=308) this will work good with realistic prompts.&nbsp; I mean, from this image into this image,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=314) this is much more realistic, but it loses&nbsp; its fantastic prompt capability. For example,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=318) from this image into this one, this is very,&nbsp; very realistic or this one. For example,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=323) from this image into this one. So this&nbsp; ultra-realistic preset will work best&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=330) in case of when you want to generate something&nbsp; that exists in real life, something that you can&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=335) get in your real life. It will make it much&nbsp; more realistic. So if you are looking that,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=341) losing the fantastic prompt capability but have&nbsp; very realistic images, you will like this. I mean&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=347) from this image into this one. This turns images&nbsp; into like real photos because this another LoRA&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=354) is trained for only real images. However, this&nbsp; is a choice. I mean from this to this, you see,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=360) it will get a huge amount of realism from this&nbsp; into this. I will explain all these presets.

- [00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=366) So first of all, download our latest SwarmUI&nbsp; model downloader and installer. The link&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=372) will be in the description of the video.&nbsp; Move the file into your existing SwarmUI,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=377) extract files, and overwrite previous files like&nbsp; this. If you don't know how to install SwarmUI,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=384) ComfyUI, how to train, all of them are explained&nbsp; in these tutorials video. You see this is the main&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=389) install tutorial video. This is install tutorial&nbsp; on cloud like MassedCompute or RunPod, and this is&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=395) our training tutorial. Let me show you each one&nbsp; of them. When you go to videos on our channel,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=400) this is our Qwen image models training video. If&nbsp; you want to do train yourself or your product or&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=407) your style, this is the video that you need&nbsp; to watch. And this is the video that you need&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=411) to follow to learn how to install SwarmUI and&nbsp; ComfyUI and use SwarmUI with ComfyUI backend.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=418) And this is the tutorial that explains how to&nbsp; install SwarmUI and ComfyUI on cloud machines&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=423) like RunPod or MassedCompute. Okay, now we have&nbsp; the newest files. First of all, start the Windows&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=428) start download models App.bat file. Run. First&nbsp; of all, if you want to have all the image models,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=435) you can download the image generation and editing&nbsp; bundle. This will only download the new LoRAs.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=440) Which one of them? The new LoRAs that we are going&nbsp; to use are these two LoRAs for realism. Moreover,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=448) I have included the FLUX Dev Fill model which&nbsp; I'm going to show you how to use to edit existing&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=455) images very fast and very accurately. If you&nbsp; want to individually download them, go to image&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=460) generation models, go to Qwen image models, and&nbsp; you will see the Qwen LoRA amateur photo. This&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=466) makes huge changes, not the one that I prefer.&nbsp; And you will see Qwen LoRA skin fix version 2.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=474) This is the one that I prefer. I will show that.&nbsp; And for the Flux fill model, it is inside Flux&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=479) models and you will see FLUX Dev Fill model. This&nbsp; is for fixing images like removing text from the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=485) certain part of the image. Once you downloaded the&nbsp; models by clicking on them, update your SwarmUI.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=492) For updating SwarmUI, I will run this, Windows&nbsp; update SwarmUI. Always have updated SwarmUI.

- [00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=498) Once the SwarmUI started, we need to get the&nbsp; new presets. So there are two ways of getting&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=504) new presets. You can use the Windows preset delete&nbsp; import. This is automatic way. For this to work,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=511) you need to have SwarmUI running. So click yes,&nbsp; it will back up your existing presets and it will&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=517) import new presets. The manual way of importing&nbsp; new presets is import presets, choose file, select&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=524) the latest preset file version 31, overwrite&nbsp; existing presets and import, and this will update&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=530) your presets. Then click refresh, sort by name,&nbsp; and you are ready to use our newest presets. So&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=538) for example, let's make an example of this image,&nbsp; how to make it more realistic. First of all,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=544) as I have shown in previous videos, reset params&nbsp; to default. Then go to presets, refresh, sort by&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=551) name, and select this preset, Qwen Image UHD High&nbsp; Realism. This is the preset that I prefer. Direct&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=558) apply. You will see that it has selected Qwen&nbsp; LoRA skin fix version 2. Now this is set as 0.6&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=566) for your self-trained models, but if you want to&nbsp; use the base Qwen image FP8 scaled, increase this&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=573) up to 1.2, 1.1, 1.2, it really works well. But&nbsp; for my own trained models, I prefer 0.6. Then&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=583) type your prompt, select your trained model if&nbsp; you are using it on a trained model. For example,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=589) I'm going to use my Qwen fine-tuned base model&nbsp; FP8 scaled. All of these explained in the training&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=595) tutorial. I will select my aspect ratio. Then I am&nbsp; ready. I will just hit generate. As I have shown&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=602) in previous tutorial, it is recommended to disable&nbsp; upscale, generate multiple images, pick the best&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=609) one you like, then enable upscale with that seed,&nbsp; but I'm not going to show it again. So let's see&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=615) our result with this realism LoRA. And we got our&nbsp; image ready. Let's say this is too much changes,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=623) you can reduce this or this is not real enough,&nbsp; you can increase this. So if you want to test&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=628) with other presets as well, you can copy this&nbsp; seed into here, just close these two LoRAs,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=635) go back to presets, and apply this one. Direct&nbsp; apply. It will select the accurate LoRAs,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=641) but you will see that it has changed the base&nbsp; model. Therefore, I'm going to switch back to&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=647) my used base model like this and generate and&nbsp; let's see the difference. So this LoRA is very&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=653) powerful. Therefore, you can reduce this to 0.4.&nbsp; It really works better that case. However, if you&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=660) are generating a very realistic image, then 0.6 is&nbsp; working very good. So this LoRA is very overfit,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=669) overtrained for amateur photographs, for making&nbsp; them more realistic. It's a choice whichever you&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=676) want, you can use, but this is how you change&nbsp; the LoRA strength, the LoRA weight from here.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=682) So try different strengths, different weights,&nbsp; and see which one is working best for you. And&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=687) this is the ultra realism preset result. So this&nbsp; was my favorite preset for realism with keeping&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=694) the fantastic prompt capability of the model, and&nbsp; this is the ultra realism result. It is up to you.

- [00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=702) So how you can inpaint an existing image with your&nbsp; trained model? The logic is same for non-trained&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=710) model as well. So first of all, load your&nbsp; image and click edit image. Then apply the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=716) preset that you have used or you have. I'm going&nbsp; to use this realism preset that we just made,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=721) and I'm going to select my trained base model,&nbsp; Qwen image base model. Then you see currently&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=728) this image is massive, 3488 to 1984. The model&nbsp; is not able to inpaint or generate this image&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=738) directly. This was an upscaled image. Therefore,&nbsp; I'm going to change this to one-to-one square.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=743) Now you will see that my working canvas&nbsp; is only this yellow area. So I am able to&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=750) only make changes on this area. So the first&nbsp; thing that I need to do is select my image,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=756) click this move like this, and make sure that&nbsp; the area that I want to make changes is inside&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=763) this yellow part and there are no transparent&nbsp; pixels. This is important. Make sure that there&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=769) are no transparent pixels. And I recommend you&nbsp; to delete this empty layer. Okay, like this. Now&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=778) select mask and select paint brush and increase&nbsp; radius. You can also use control. So I'm going&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=785) to inpaint the entire face like this. And turn&nbsp; off the refine upscale. Okay, are we ready? Not&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=793) yet. So you will see that currently these are my&nbsp; init image settings. I'm going to go presets and&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=799) I am going to apply the inpainting preset. Direct&nbsp; apply, and it will set the accurate settings. It&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=806) is going to use mask shrink grow. What this does&nbsp; is it is going to use this full resolution 1328 to&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=813) 1328 only on this masked area, not this entire&nbsp; yellow canvas. So it is only going to use this&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=821) part. And then there is one more thing. So with&nbsp; Qwen, we are doing four steps by using the Qwen&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=828) image edit lightning LoRA. Therefore, if I run my&nbsp; generation right now, it will only do two steps.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=836) Why? Because my step count is 4 and my init image&nbsp; creativity is 0.6. So when you multiply 0.6 with&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=843) 4, it is going to do 2.4 steps, which is ceiled&nbsp; to two. Therefore, I need to set this into 7. With&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=852) Flux, you need to make recalculations. This is how&nbsp; the number of steps works, but usually Flux preset&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=858) is working, I will show. So the prompt will be&nbsp; ohwx man and generate. Now this generation will be&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=865) ultra fast. Why? Because it is only 1328 to 1328&nbsp; with only four steps. So one advantage is that I&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=872) can generate multiple images like this, and I can&nbsp; pick the best one. So you see this is the preview.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=878) Okay, this is the first generation. If I like&nbsp; this, I can use this. You can generate multiple&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=883) ones because this will be so fast. It is taking&nbsp; like 15 seconds. Okay, this is another one. Okay,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=890) here. So generate as many as you want with seed&nbsp; -1. Each generation will be different. Then look&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=897) at the results. Okay, let's see. Let's say I&nbsp; liked this one and I want to use this one. So,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=904) are we done? No, we need to merge this generated&nbsp; image into our image. So drag and drop it into&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=910) here. You will see that there is now another&nbsp; image in our working space. And before saving&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=917) this image, delete this layer as well. So there&nbsp; should be only two images like this. Go to this&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=924) three dots icon and store full canvas to history.&nbsp; And then you will see that you got the new image.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=931) So let's compare these two images. Okay, now we&nbsp; have a comparison. So this was our base image and&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=938) this is our inpainted image. From this image into&nbsp; this image. This image into this image. We have&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=946) significantly improved the quality of the face&nbsp; like this as you are seeing. From this to this,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=953) this to this. So there is another thing that&nbsp; you can do. If you find that this has changed&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=958) the color or other thing, even though you have&nbsp; made a lot of generations, what you can do is you&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=965) can disable the mask shrink grow. So let's reverse&nbsp; our changes. Okay, the reverse is not working, so&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=973) therefore we need to start from beginning. So drag&nbsp; and drop our image, edit image, and again, we will&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=980) select the one-to-one square, select this base&nbsp; image, move it like this, select the mask. Make&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=987) sure to select mask, paint brush, select wherever&nbsp; the area you want. Then okay, it is set. I am&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=994) going to disable this mask shrink grow to show you&nbsp; its effect. So now instead of only focusing on the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=1002) face part, it will draw the entire image but only&nbsp; change the face part. This is another option that&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=1008) you can do. Whichever works better for you, you&nbsp; can use it. So make a comparison and see which&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=1015) one is you are liking more. Furthermore, what you&nbsp; can do is you can change this mask blur. Sometimes&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=1023) more blur can help or sometimes lesser can help&nbsp; like this. So these are the options that you can&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=1030) do. Of course, you can change image creativity as&nbsp; well. So if I make this 50%, like this, then to&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=1038) do four steps, I need to make step count 8 because&nbsp; 8 multiplied with 0.5 is four steps and generate.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=1046) So this way, I can make multiple generations,&nbsp; multiple fixes and pick the best one that I like.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=1054) For example, this one, another generation. By the&nbsp; way, when you look at it from far away like this,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=1060) you won't notice the color difference. It will&nbsp; look pretty, pretty good, like this one. Okay,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=1066) so which one of them I like most? Let's say I&nbsp; like this one most. This is looking pretty good&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=1072) one. Again, I will drag and drop it here.&nbsp; Then I will delete this layer and I will&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=1076) delete this layer. Then I will go three dots,&nbsp; store full canvas to history. Alternatively,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=1082) you can download full canvas and both of them will&nbsp; work. So you can either download full canvas or&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=1089) just store it. And you don't need a trained model&nbsp; to do this. You can do this with other models as&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=1093) well. Let me demonstrate you. So let's refresh.&nbsp; Quick tools, reset params to default. Let's go to&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=1099) presets and Flux dev models. Direct apply. Move my&nbsp; image, edit image. First, change the resolution,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=1107) one-to-one square. Then move the image, select the&nbsp; image, move it like this one. Then mask the area&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=1115) that you want. So select mask, paint brush. I'm&nbsp; using control button. Okay, I masked it. And this&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=1122) time, it is a Flux preset, so I will just say that&nbsp; photo of a man and I'm going to increase the image&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=1128) creativity because I want to change it into a&nbsp; different man like this and generate. So this way,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=1134) I'm going to use Flux base model to change it.&nbsp; Actually, let's use the Flux SRPO model. This&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=1141) is much more realistic. So I'm going to change&nbsp; it into Flux SRPO. Or I can even use my Flux&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=1149) SRPO DreamBooth trained model. Let's see that too&nbsp; as well. I'm not sure what we are going to get.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=1156) And this is going to make 40 multiplied with&nbsp; 0.95 times steps. Always calculate the number&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=1164) of steps if you are using lightning LoRAs that&nbsp; requires certain number of steps, you have to pay&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=1169) attention to that. Okay, it is changed into this.&nbsp; We can make this even 100% like this one. Let's&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=1178) see what we are going to get. Okay. Yeah, when we&nbsp; make it 100%, it is losing its initial capability,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=1187) so we should make this like maybe 99%. Probably it&nbsp; wouldn't make a difference. So 95% is what we get&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=1195) best. Therefore, we should try multiple times and&nbsp; I can notice that there is some color difference.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=1202) To make this color difference, we should make&nbsp; this zero. Okay, let's try again. We didn't apply&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=1208) our preset. We have forgotten that. Let's apply&nbsp; our preset. Let's make this 95%. Okay. So with&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=1216) inpainting, you have to make some tests. Sometimes&nbsp; this color difference can't be fully prevented,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=1222) unfortunately. This is what you need to test&nbsp; and this is how you inpaint. In most cases,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=1228) it won't be very noticeable, especially if it&nbsp; is not like this one. Okay, I can even make this&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=1235) 90%. So try mask blur 8. So keep trying until&nbsp; you get a good result. I am also going to use&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=1243) my Flux DreamBooth model, Flux SRPO DreamBooth&nbsp; model, and let's see what we get. Maybe I will&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=1249) try this 60%. The lesser init image creativity, it&nbsp; should make a lesser color difference. This has a&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=1257) huge difference. So let's try 16 mask blur. I'm&nbsp; not sure you need to test. This is a bigger mask&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=1263) blur. It also has some hard difference. This was&nbsp; very close. Okay, for example, this is inpainted&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=1270) with Flux SRPO. It is not yet great. So if you&nbsp; don't want to get that annoying color difference,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=1278) what you can do is delete the mask, add a mask&nbsp; layer, and make a much more precise masking. So&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=1285) if you make a much more precise masking and avoid&nbsp; masking unwanted areas, you will minimize your&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=1294) color differences. This is probably more accurate&nbsp; way of inpainting, rather than masking the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=1301) entire thing, just mask the area that you want to&nbsp; inpaint, and you will get lesser color like this.

- [00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=1308) So for outpainting, let's refresh our page,&nbsp; reset params to default. We are going to use&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=1314) outpainting preset. This preset is going to&nbsp; use Flux fill dev model. Outpainting is very&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=1320) similar to inpainting. There are few tricks that&nbsp; you have to follow. So I will click edit image&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=1326) after I loaded my image. So you see, this is my&nbsp; resolution. One of the most important thing is&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=1332) the resolution. As close as it is 1 megapixel, it&nbsp; will work better. So for outpainting this image,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=1339) I am going to change my resolution to 1024&nbsp; pixel. This is the best resolution. However,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=1346) it can do bigger outpaintings as well. Normally,&nbsp; you should do slower outpaintings. What I mean&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=1354) by that, for example, you should first outpaint&nbsp; into this one, then increase it further. However,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=1361) let's try this one. This is a big one. So I will&nbsp; delete this mask and I will add another mask&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=1366) layer and just paint brush like this. Then let's&nbsp; generate eight images with different seeds to pick&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=1375) the best one. This is pretty fast depending on&nbsp; your resolution. Since this is 1 megapixel, it is&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=1381) going to be fairly fast. You see the first image&nbsp; didn't work very well. Let's look at the newer&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=1388) ones. If you also see a preview like this, you can&nbsp; just cancel that and move to the next one. That is&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=1395) another alternative. Okay, you see the third one&nbsp; is going to work. If it doesn't work, then you&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=1401) need to reduce your resolution and do smaller&nbsp; steps outpainting. This is the logic. Okay,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=1407) this one worked. So this is the image. So what is&nbsp; the smaller step? Let's outpaint into 1024 to 896&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=1418) first. So if you do smaller steps, it will work&nbsp; much better. So you see, the first image is almost&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=1424) perfect. And yes, it is done like this. Then what&nbsp; I need to do is I will select this image, drag and&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=1431) drop it into here, and then delete this mask and&nbsp; this image layer and click this three dots icon,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=1437) store current image to history. Then I can click&nbsp; edit image and I can begin again. So I will&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=1444) now expand it like this, and then just delete&nbsp; this mask, make a new mask and like this. You&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=1452) don't need to fill it entirely and generate. Pay&nbsp; attention that I am not typing anything because it&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=1457) is seeing this entire image and based on that,&nbsp; Flux fill dev model is outpainting it. This is&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=1464) the logic of Flux fill dev model. And you see, now&nbsp; it will work much better. How about bigger images?&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=1471) Can it do outpainting them as well? Let's try one&nbsp; of them. Okay, I will cancel this, remove this&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=1477) image. Okay, for example, this is 1328 to 1328.&nbsp; This is bigger than the native resolution of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=1486) Flux fill dev model. So first, try outpaint like&nbsp; this. Okay, first, let's delete the mask layer,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=1493) add a new mask so it will fit into here. Select&nbsp; mask, select paint brush, type like this and&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=1499) generate. Since this is a bigger image, it is&nbsp; going to take longer to generate, but let's see&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=1505) what can it do. Can it do this resolution? This&nbsp; is a pretty big resolution, almost 2 megapixel.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=1510) So far, it looks like it is handling it good.&nbsp; So this is the logic of outpainting. This way, I&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=1516) can outpaint multiple times. Okay, it is done and&nbsp; looking perfect. Yes, no issues. So first, let's&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=1524) apply this. Okay, let's delete this layer, delete&nbsp; this image layer, and store current image to&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=1531) history. Then edit image. Now I will outpaint to&nbsp; the this part like this. Or you can outpaint even&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=1539) further like this. How? Select image from here.&nbsp; While hitting shift key, move it to the right like&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=1547) this. Okay. Then delete this mask layer, add a new&nbsp; mask layer, select paint brush, add mask like this&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=1556) and hit generate. Now we will be expanding from&nbsp; both sides. We can even expand from all sides. It&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=1564) is totally possible. I will show that too. And we&nbsp; are expanding it into a massive resolution. Okay,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=1571) let's cancel. Wow, looking pretty good, pretty&nbsp; good. So let's do another example. This time I am&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=1579) going to expand from all sides. So let's make this&nbsp; bigger like this. You see? Then select the image,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=1588) move it with shift key like this so it will be&nbsp; more proportional. Then delete this mask layer,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=1595) add a mask layer, paint brush, just this. This&nbsp; is sufficient and hit generate. So now we will&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=1602) be expanding from all sides. This way, you can&nbsp; outpaint your images with a really, really good&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=1609) quality with our prepared outpainting preset. And&nbsp; as you do bigger resolution, it will take more&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=1615) time, as you can assume, but it is working great.&nbsp; So far, the preview is looking good. This way,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=1622) I can outpaint entire image at once. And it is&nbsp; done. You see, even at the first try, I got a&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=1629) very, very good result. This is the amazing&nbsp; result. So this is how you outpaint images.

- [00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=1635) Okay, last thing is removing something that we&nbsp; want to have in images. So let's refresh the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=1642) page. Quick tools, reset params to default. Go to&nbsp; presets, Flux dev models, direct apply. Then from&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=1649) the models, select the Flux dev fill model. Load&nbsp; the image that you want to fix, make changes, edit&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=1657) image. The first thing is setting the accurate&nbsp; resolution. So our working canvas is now this&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=1663) yellow area. Select image, move. So move it into&nbsp; the position which one you want to fix. I am going&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=1671) to remove this text. This is a noise in my image.&nbsp; Then I am going to select mask, paint brush,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=1680) select the area like this. Now, for this one, I am&nbsp; going to use init image creativity 1, and I am not&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=1687) going to enable mask shrink grow because this&nbsp; way it works better. I'm not going to type any&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=1694) prompt. Therefore, it will analyze entire image&nbsp; and it is going to only change this part. And&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=1699) you can make the mask blur 1 or 4. You should try&nbsp; multiple. I think some cases 4 is working better,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=1707) some cases 1 is working better. As you reduce&nbsp; it, it is making more changes. This is what I&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=1713) understand. For example, currently it is going to&nbsp; remove it. Yes. You see, it has removed the text.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=1720) This is not perfect, so I can try multiple times&nbsp; or I can play with the mask blur and see which&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=1726) one will be perfect. Okay, second case doesn't&nbsp; look like it has removed. Yeah, the third case,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=1732) it looks like it is going to remove. So with each&nbsp; seed, it will make a different and when you don't&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=1739) provide any prompt, it is supposed to make the&nbsp; changes according to the environment. Yes, this&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=1746) is looking much better. And here another one we&nbsp; are going to get. You can also increase the mask&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=1753) size like this and try because we want it to have&nbsp; more information. Okay, so currently these are my&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=1762) init image settings, creativity 1 and mask blur 8,&nbsp; mask grow 0. I don't need mask grow. Okay, this is&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=1771) looking much better for example. So I'm going to&nbsp; apply this. Drag and drop this image into here.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=1776) Delete the mask layer, delete this image. Why I&nbsp; am deleting that image? Because currently you see&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=1782) this image has a canvas like this. So if I store&nbsp; full canvas to history, you will get an empty&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=1790) space like this. You see? Because it is applying&nbsp; this canvas too. So either I have to move them&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=1797) into the same place or I have to delete this, then&nbsp; I will store full canvas to history. And yes. So I&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=1805) have only modified this part of the image, removed&nbsp; that noise text by using the Flux fill model.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=1812) This is the logic of working with inpainting in&nbsp; SwarmUI. As you do more practice, as you use it&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=1819) more, you will get used to it. And hopefully, more&nbsp; tutorials are coming soon. For example, now we&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=1825) have Levo song generation model version 7. Now we&nbsp; are supporting the newest full model. It is very,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=1834) very capable. It is able to generate up to 4.5&nbsp; minute songs. I am still working it. It is not&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=1842) fully done yet. So let me turn off my SwarmUI to&nbsp; make an example for you. This is another tutorials&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=1849) topic, but why not seeing now? Okay. This is our&nbsp; interface. You see now we are supporting song&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=1855) generation large, best quality. So let's generate&nbsp; a song live and let's see. This is the default&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=1862) song that we have. This is running locally,&nbsp; so you are not bound to any other services,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=1867) online services. And recently, one of the famous&nbsp; AI music generation service stopped its working.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=1875) So this is the way of future, I say. And it is&nbsp; getting pretty good VRAM optimized. Hopefully,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=1882) I am going to also add FP8 scaled model loading&nbsp; and perhaps block swapping as well to this model,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=1890) but currently it is working really, really&nbsp; good. Okay, it is doing the diffusion&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=1894) steps. You see it is only using 6 GB of VRAM while&nbsp; doing the diffusion steps. Then it is doing the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=1901) VAE decoding and first it has generated&nbsp; the audio tokens. It is super optimized,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=1907) but hopefully it will get even further optimized,&nbsp; and it is using minimal amount of VRAM right now.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=1913) The speed is very decent. For like a three&nbsp; minutes of song, it takes like three to four&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=1918) minutes to generate. Maybe we will optimize&nbsp; this further. Okay, all segments generated.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzZ2wnzNuQ&t=1924) File saved. Now let's listen our generated&nbsp; song. So you see it is 2 minutes 53 seconds.
