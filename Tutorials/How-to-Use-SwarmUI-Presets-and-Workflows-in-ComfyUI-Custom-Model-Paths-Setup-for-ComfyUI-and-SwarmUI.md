- [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqFilBM3i7s&t=0) Greetings everyone. Today I am going to show you&nbsp; how to use SwarmUI generated workflows, presets in&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqFilBM3i7s&t=7) ComfyUI. This is Z Image Turbo with ControlNet.&nbsp; This is Wan 2.2 Image to Video 4 steps. This&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqFilBM3i7s&t=16) is Qwen Image Edit 25+11. And you know we have&nbsp; amazing presets in SwarmUI and a lot of people&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqFilBM3i7s&t=24) were asking me how you can use these presets in&nbsp; ComfyUI with easiness. Furthermore, I will show&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqFilBM3i7s&t=31) you by using extra model paths.yaml file, how you&nbsp; can use your existing model files inside SwarmUI&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqFilBM3i7s&t=41) or how you can use your existing models in ComfyUI&nbsp; in SwarmUI. So you won't be doing duplicate of&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqFilBM3i7s&t=50) models. For this tutorial, you need to update&nbsp; your ComfyUI to the latest version. You see we&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqFilBM3i7s&t=56) have ComfyUI version 70. It may get updated when&nbsp; you are watching this tutorial. The link will be&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqFilBM3i7s&t=62) in the description of the video. Move the zip file&nbsp; into your existing installation. You can also make&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqFilBM3i7s&t=67) a fresh installation. If you don't know how to&nbsp; install ComfyUI, we have a tutorial. It is here.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqFilBM3i7s&t=74) The link will be also in the description of the&nbsp; video so watch it. Then extract everything inside&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqFilBM3i7s&t=79) this file into here and overwrite everything.&nbsp; This is important. Then first of all run the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqFilBM3i7s&t=84) windows install or update comfyui.bat file. We&nbsp; have improved our installer into UV so it is&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqFilBM3i7s&t=92) super fast to install and update. Moreover, this&nbsp; will install the necessary additional custom nodes&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqFilBM3i7s&t=99) to run the SwarmUI workflows inside ComfyUI.&nbsp; So everything is updated and installed. One&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqFilBM3i7s&t=105) another thing you need to run windows custom node&nbsp; install swarmui extra nodes. Double click and run&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqFilBM3i7s&t=111) it. This will be automatically installed with&nbsp; the Massed Compute and RunPod so both of them&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqFilBM3i7s&t=119) will be fully automatic. You don't need this one.&nbsp; Okay it is also done. So our ComfyUI is now up&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqFilBM3i7s&t=126) to date. And as a next step we will update our&nbsp; SwarmUI and our presets. So download the latest&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqFilBM3i7s&t=132) zip file from here. The link will be also in the&nbsp; description of the video. If you don't know how&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqFilBM3i7s&t=137) to install and use SwarmUI, this tutorial is here&nbsp; so watch it. Move the SwarmUI installer into here&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqFilBM3i7s&t=144) and extract it and overwrite all the files. So&nbsp; you need to run the windows update swarmui.bat&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqFilBM3i7s&t=151) file. This will update your SwarmUI to latest&nbsp; and start it. Then you need to import newest&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqFilBM3i7s&t=158) presets. You can use import choose file, select&nbsp; the latest amazing SwarmUI presets, overwrite,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqFilBM3i7s&t=165) or better alternative is while the SwarmUI is&nbsp; running, use the windows preset delete import.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqFilBM3i7s&t=173) This will clear your history with a backup and&nbsp; import everything. Then click refresh and you&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqFilBM3i7s&t=179) will have all the up to date presets. So how you&nbsp; can use a preset? I want to show you Z Image Turbo&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqFilBM3i7s&t=188) quality 1 with newest ControlNet. To have&nbsp; the newest ControlNet, start the windows&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqFilBM3i7s&t=195) start download models.bat file. We also have&nbsp; updated this application. It is now much faster,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqFilBM3i7s&t=201) better. And in the Z Image Turbo Core Bundle, you&nbsp; can download the entire bundle. So let's download&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqFilBM3i7s&t=208) it. It will only download your missing files. The&nbsp; new ControlNet is the Z Image Turbo Fun ControlNet&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqFilBM3i7s&t=215) Union 2.1 8 steps. So I already have it. What&nbsp; I am going to do is quick tools, reset params&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqFilBM3i7s&t=221) to default and I am going to apply my preset,&nbsp; direct apply. For Z Image Turbo with a ControlNet,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqFilBM3i7s&t=229) I am going to use my trained LoRA, this one. I&nbsp; will use this prompt and as a ControlNet image,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqFilBM3i7s&t=236) I am going to choose file, select this file. You&nbsp; see this is 3 to 2 aspect ratio. I did it this&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqFilBM3i7s&t=243) way and I will change the aspect ratio from here&nbsp; to same and I will set the control preprocessor&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqFilBM3i7s&t=251) to Canny Edge preprocessor. When you click preview&nbsp; it will show us the preview. All of the ControlNet&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqFilBM3i7s&t=258) necessary models are also automatically installed&nbsp; with our installers. So you don't spend any time.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqFilBM3i7s&t=264) Okay it is accurate. You see this is matching&nbsp; to this. This preview is generated according to&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqFilBM3i7s&t=270) your resolution. Then as a ControlNet strength&nbsp; I recommend 0.6. And as a ControlNet model we&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqFilBM3i7s&t=277) select this new one. This is better than the older&nbsp; version I have compared. Now the entire workflow&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqFilBM3i7s&t=283) is ready. So go to ComfyUI workflow, import from&nbsp; generate tab. Wait for this screen to get updated.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqFilBM3i7s&t=292) You can also remove and click again to be sure.&nbsp; You see it is updated. Now click this menu icon,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqFilBM3i7s&t=300) go to file, export. Give a name like Z Image Turbo&nbsp; Tutorial and it will be saved into your downloads&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqFilBM3i7s&t=308) folder. Now our ComfyUI workflow is ready.&nbsp; I will close my SwarmUI and I will start my&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqFilBM3i7s&t=316) ComfyUI. There is one additional thing that you&nbsp; need to do to use your models saved inside your&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqFilBM3i7s&t=323) SwarmUI. You see we have extra model paths.yaml&nbsp; file. Copy it into your ComfyUI folder like this.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqFilBM3i7s&t=331) Then open this file with any text editor. I&nbsp; am going to use Notepad++. All you need to&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqFilBM3i7s&t=338) do is changing this, wherever you have installed&nbsp; your SwarmUI. So my SwarmUI is installed here. I&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqFilBM3i7s&t=346) copy this path and I paste it like this and put a&nbsp; backslash to end of it like this and save. So it&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqFilBM3i7s&t=353) is going to check these folders and assign them&nbsp; to these keys. So these keys are checkpoints,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqFilBM3i7s&t=361) text encoders are same as inside your ComfyUI&nbsp; models folder. So these are keys, you see. And&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqFilBM3i7s&t=367) these are the relative paths that whatever folder&nbsp; you are giving. You can also add here more folder&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqFilBM3i7s&t=375) options and these will be extra to your ComfyUI&nbsp; folders. So it will see both the files inside&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqFilBM3i7s&t=382) here and also whatever are inside here. Then I&nbsp; will start my ComfyUI and run. So this way we are&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqFilBM3i7s&t=389) unifying our folder structure and we are avoiding&nbsp; model duplication. Okay so my ComfyUI started. I&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqFilBM3i7s&t=397) will show how to open that preset. So the preset&nbsp; was downloaded into my downloads folder. I will&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqFilBM3i7s&t=404) drag and drop it here and it is loaded. There is&nbsp; few key things that you need to fix. First of all&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqFilBM3i7s&t=411) SwarmUI uses its own load image and save image,&nbsp; save video. Therefore you need to change this. So&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqFilBM3i7s&t=419) it is so easy. Add node, image and you see there&nbsp; is load image like this. Then click choose file,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqFilBM3i7s&t=428) choose your ControlNet image in this case. If&nbsp; it was init to image then you would choose init&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqFilBM3i7s&t=433) image. It is same. Then click here and drag and&nbsp; drop it to here. So you see now this Canny Edge&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqFilBM3i7s&t=441) which is going to pre process this image and&nbsp; use as a Canny is connect to this load image.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqFilBM3i7s&t=446) Okay that's it. And in the save, if you want to&nbsp; save auto generated images, we need to add a save&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqFilBM3i7s&t=453) image node. This is not saving in the ComfyUI&nbsp; unfortunately. So add a node and image and you&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqFilBM3i7s&t=460) see there is save image. And all I need to do is&nbsp; connect this. So it will both show and save. You&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqFilBM3i7s&t=466) can have both of them and run. Now let's watch the&nbsp; CMD window and the nvitop. So it is going to use&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqFilBM3i7s&t=475) ComfyUI with full features with full optimization&nbsp; with the very best configuration workflow because&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqFilBM3i7s&t=483) our presets are extremely well prepared. This&nbsp; workflow even upscales the generated image. So&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqFilBM3i7s&t=490) this is a very good workflow. It is also using&nbsp; the ControlNet. You see the final image is being&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqFilBM3i7s&t=496) 2272 to 1552. So this way you can prepare your&nbsp; workflow in SwarmUI then use it in ComfyUI.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqFilBM3i7s&t=509) Okay. So you see the image is generated. Now I&nbsp; can see it inside my ComfyUI inside output and&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqFilBM3i7s&t=517) it is here. So you see it is saved. When I open it&nbsp; I can see it full size. And this newer ControlNet&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqFilBM3i7s&t=524) is really good. So you see it is even matching&nbsp; the background and it is generating my trained&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqFilBM3i7s&t=530) self. If you don't know how to train yourself&nbsp; with Z Image Turbo, we have an amazing tutorial&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqFilBM3i7s&t=536) here. So you see this tutorial is a masterpiece to&nbsp; learn Z Image Turbo training. We also have Wan 2.2&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqFilBM3i7s&t=544) training which is very recently published. It is&nbsp; also amazing. We also have Qwen Image training&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqFilBM3i7s&t=550) tutorial. We have FLUX training tutorials. We&nbsp; have training tutorials for all the major very&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqFilBM3i7s&t=556) best AI models at the moment. Okay so this worked&nbsp; really great. What about running a video workflow?&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqFilBM3i7s&t=563) So I will start my SwarmUI again to generate the&nbsp; workflow and use it inside ComfyUI. So again quick&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqFilBM3i7s&t=570) tools reset params to default. Go to presets. My&nbsp; recommended image to video is this one. This is&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqFilBM3i7s&t=578) amazing. So direct apply. Then let's select our&nbsp; init image. So let's select this one for example.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqFilBM3i7s&t=585) Let's make the use closest aspect ratio. So the&nbsp; prompt is a man is talking in an award ceremony.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqFilBM3i7s&t=592) Everything is set. All I need to do is ComfyUI&nbsp; workflow, import from generate tab, updated. File,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqFilBM3i7s&t=600) export. Let's say Wan 2.2 image to video. Then I&nbsp; will close my SwarmUI. Go back into our ComfyUI&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqFilBM3i7s&t=609) and let's load new. Open. Select the downloaded&nbsp; JSON file. And you see the workflow is loaded. Now&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqFilBM3i7s&t=617) I need to change the SwarmUI load image again. So&nbsp; add node, image, load image. Then I will move this&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqFilBM3i7s&t=625) to here and also you see there is upscale image&nbsp; here. That's it. You can delete this one if you&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqFilBM3i7s&t=633) want like remove. Then I also need to add a save.&nbsp; So this save doesn't work in the ComfyUI and you&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqFilBM3i7s&t=641) see we are also using RIFE 2x frame interpolation.&nbsp; So for saving, right click add node, image,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqFilBM3i7s&t=649) video. And from here you see there is create&nbsp; video, save video. Let's say create video.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqFilBM3i7s&t=654) This is taking images, image sequence. So drag&nbsp; and drop this here and set the FPS as 30 or 32.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqFilBM3i7s&t=663) This will create a video but not save it. Then add&nbsp; node, image, video and save video. Then connect&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqFilBM3i7s&t=671) this. So this will save the video as well. So you&nbsp; can remove this and run. Let's see the process.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqFilBM3i7s&t=678) So now it will use the entire workflow. We only&nbsp; change load image, save image, save video and&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqFilBM3i7s&t=686) if necessary load video. So you need to do this&nbsp; manually unfortunately because SwarmUI handles&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqFilBM3i7s&t=692) it differently than the ComfyUI but the rest is&nbsp; all working. With perfect accuracy, same results&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqFilBM3i7s&t=700) as in the SwarmUI because SwarmUI uses ComfyUI&nbsp; as a backend. So it is starting. It is fully&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqFilBM3i7s&t=706) optimized. If your VRAM is like 6 gigabyte it will&nbsp; still work. It will do automatic block swapping.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqFilBM3i7s&t=712) How do I know? For example I can even use BF 16&nbsp; model. It is 40 gigabytes. It doesn't fit into&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqFilBM3i7s&t=719) my VRAM but it fully works with full speed. So as&nbsp; long as you have sufficient amount of RAM memory,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqFilBM3i7s&t=725) every model will work. Okay it is getting&nbsp; generated right now. You may also get this&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqFilBM3i7s&t=730) Unet unexpected. It is unimportant. You can ignore&nbsp; it. Okay the first part of the video generated.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqFilBM3i7s&t=737) You know the Wan 2.2 uses both high noise and low&nbsp; noise. High noise generates the initial video, low&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqFilBM3i7s&t=744) noise adds details. And it is almost done. Let's&nbsp; see. Now it will do the RIFE frame interpolation.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqFilBM3i7s&t=752) Yes it is running here. You see the running node&nbsp; is highlighted like this. Okay almost done. Yes&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqFilBM3i7s&t=760) now saving video and it is saved. Oh we have given&nbsp; the inaccurate image. However it is working. Which&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqFilBM3i7s&t=767) image did we give? Yes we given this image. This&nbsp; is not the image that we were going to give but it&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqFilBM3i7s&t=774) worked as you can see. So this is how you use the&nbsp; SwarmUI presets in ComfyUI. Don't worry it will&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqFilBM3i7s&t=782) work exactly same in the RunPod and Massed Compute&nbsp; in the cloud because I did the installation fully&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqFilBM3i7s&t=789) automatic for there as well. If you don't know&nbsp; how to install and use SwarmUI and ComfyUI in&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqFilBM3i7s&t=795) cloud like RunPod and Massed Compute, we also&nbsp; have amazing tutorial for that. You see this is&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqFilBM3i7s&t=800) ComfyUI and SwarmUI on cloud GPUs. So if you are&nbsp; GPU poor, you can watch this tutorial to use it&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqFilBM3i7s&t=807) on the cloud like Massed Compute or RunPod. And&nbsp; finally how you can use the models inside ComfyUI&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqFilBM3i7s&t=813) in SwarmUI. So for SwarmUI go to server, go to&nbsp; server configuration. You need to change your&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqFilBM3i7s&t=819) model root. So you see I need to give the model&nbsp; root of the ComfyUI. It is here as models. So I&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqFilBM3i7s&t=828) will copy paste this. Then I will save and it is&nbsp; saved. Then you can change the some of the model&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqFilBM3i7s&t=834) names. For example SD LoRA folder. This is not&nbsp; matching with the ComfyUI. The ComfyUI uses LoRAs.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqFilBM3i7s&t=842) Therefore you need to change this to LoRAs and&nbsp; save. So pay attention to these factors then it&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqFilBM3i7s&t=849) will see your ComfyUI folder structure in SwarmUI.&nbsp; This way you can avoid duplicating models.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqFilBM3i7s&t=856) Don't forget the save. Whenever you make a change&nbsp; it will ask you to save. So today's tutorial was&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqFilBM3i7s&t=863) this much and I am working on Trellis 2 premium&nbsp; application. This model is insane. It can generate&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqFilBM3i7s&t=870) very high resolution very high quality both mesh&nbsp; and texture. You see currently this is only 512&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqFilBM3i7s&t=877) resolution with 1024 texture and it is already&nbsp; amazing. I am working on all kind of possible&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqFilBM3i7s&t=884) optimizations. If you are very professional you&nbsp; will be able to run it in the cloud with maximum&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqFilBM3i7s&t=890) quality or in your local computer. It will save&nbsp; all the generated files like this. So you will&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqFilBM3i7s&t=897) have all the GLB, GLTF, binary, object, PLY, STL.&nbsp; We will have everything, the material file. We&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqFilBM3i7s&t=907) will save it. We will save the previews like this.&nbsp; So this application will be hopefully amazing. I&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqFilBM3i7s&t=913) am about to complete it. There is also view 3D&nbsp; files, texturing help guide. I am also working on&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqFilBM3i7s&t=920) to implement batch processing so you will give a&nbsp; folder and it will process all the files. We also&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqFilBM3i7s&t=926) have config preset save and load. Furthermore our&nbsp; ultimate video and image upscaler application is&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqFilBM3i7s&t=933) also getting done. It is going to support SeedVR&nbsp; 2 with full features, face restoration, RIFE FPS,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqFilBM3i7s&t=941) image based, Flash VSR. So this is a massive&nbsp; application. Hopefully it will be also done. These&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqFilBM3i7s&t=948) errors are because the application is not running.&nbsp; So stay subscribed, leave a comment. You can ask&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqFilBM3i7s&t=953) me any questions from Patreon, from YouTube,&nbsp; wherever you want. Hopefully see you later.
