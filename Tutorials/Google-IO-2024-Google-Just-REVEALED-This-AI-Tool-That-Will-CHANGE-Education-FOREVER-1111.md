- [00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXEVPH4YbeI&t=8) Listening to everything that's been announced today, it's clear that AI is already helping people.

- [00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXEVPH4YbeI&t=15) From their everyday tasks to their most ambitious, productive and imaginative endeavors.

- [00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXEVPH4YbeI&t=23) Our AI innovations like multi-modality, long contexts and agents

- [00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXEVPH4YbeI&t=28) are at the cutting edge of what this technology can do.

- [00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXEVPH4YbeI&t=31) Take it to a whole new level, its capacity to help people.

- [00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXEVPH4YbeI&t=36) Yet, as with any emerging technology, there are still risks

- [00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXEVPH4YbeI&t=41) and new questions that will arise as AI advances and its uses evolve.

- [00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXEVPH4YbeI&t=47) In navigating these complexities, we're guided by our AI principles

- [00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXEVPH4YbeI&t=52) and we're learning from our users, partners and our own research.

- [00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXEVPH4YbeI&t=58) To us, building AI responsibly means both addressing the risks

- [00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXEVPH4YbeI&t=63) and maximizing the benefits for people and society.

- [00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXEVPH4YbeI&t=67) Let me begin with what we're doing to address the risks.

- [00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXEVPH4YbeI&t=70) Here I want to focus on how we're improving our models

- [00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXEVPH4YbeI&t=74) and protecting against their misuse.

- [00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXEVPH4YbeI&t=77) Beyond what Demis shared earlier, we're improving our models

- [00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXEVPH4YbeI&t=81) with an industry standard practice called red teaming

- [00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXEVPH4YbeI&t=84) in which we test our own models and try to break them to identify weaknesses.

- [00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXEVPH4YbeI&t=89) Adding to this work, we're developing a cutting edge technique

- [00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXEVPH4YbeI&t=94) we call AI assisted red teaming.

- [00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXEVPH4YbeI&t=97) This draws on Google DeepMind's gaming breakthroughs like AlphaGo

- [00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXEVPH4YbeI&t=101) where we train AI agents to compete against each other

- [00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXEVPH4YbeI&t=105) and improve and expand the scope of their red teaming capabilities.

- [00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXEVPH4YbeI&t=109) We're developing AI models with these capabilities

- [00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXEVPH4YbeI&t=113) to help address adversarial prompting and limit problematic outputs.

- [00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXEVPH4YbeI&t=118) We're also improving our models with feedback from two important groups.

- [00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXEVPH4YbeI&t=123) Thousands of internal safety experts with a range of disciplines

- [00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXEVPH4YbeI&t=128) and a range of independent experts from academia to civil society.

- [00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXEVPH4YbeI&t=133) Both groups help us identify emerging risks from cybersecurity threats

- [00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXEVPH4YbeI&t=139) to potentially dangerous capabilities in areas like chem bio.

- [00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXEVPH4YbeI&t=144) Combining human insight with our safety testing methods

- [00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXEVPH4YbeI&t=149) will help make our models and products more accurate, reliable, and safer.

- [00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXEVPH4YbeI&t=156) This is particularly important as technical advances like better intonation

- [00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXEVPH4YbeI&t=161) make interactions with AI feel and sound more human-like.

- [00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXEVPH4YbeI&t=167) We're doing a lot of research in this area, including the potential for harm and misuse.

- [00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXEVPH4YbeI&t=173) We're also developing new tools to help prevent the misuse of our models.

- [00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXEVPH4YbeI&t=178) For example, Imagine 3 and Veo create more realistic imagery and videos.

- [00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXEVPH4YbeI&t=185) We must also consider how they might be misused to spread misinformation.

- [00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXEVPH4YbeI&t=190) To help last year, we introduced SynthID,

- [00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXEVPH4YbeI&t=194) a tool that adds imperceptible watermarks to our AI-generated images and audio

- [00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXEVPH4YbeI&t=200) so that they're easier to identify.

- [00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXEVPH4YbeI&t=203) Today, we're expanding SynthID to two new modalities, text and video.

- [00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXEVPH4YbeI&t=210) These launches build on our efforts to deploy

- [00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXEVPH4YbeI&t=213) state-of-the-art watermarking capabilities across modalities.

- [00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXEVPH4YbeI&t=217) Moving forward, we'll keep integrating advances like watermarking

- [00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXEVPH4YbeI&t=221) and other emerging techniques to secure our latest generations

- [00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXEVPH4YbeI&t=225) of Gemini, Imagine, Liria, and Veo models.

- [00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXEVPH4YbeI&t=230) We're also committed to working with the ecosystem with all of you

- [00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXEVPH4YbeI&t=234) to help others build on the advances we're making.

- [00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXEVPH4YbeI&t=237) And in the coming months, we'll be open sourcing SynthID text watermarking.

- [00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXEVPH4YbeI&t=244) This will be available in our updated responsible generative AI toolkit,

- [00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXEVPH4YbeI&t=248) which we created to make it easier for developers to build AI responsibly.

- [00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXEVPH4YbeI&t=254) We're also collaborating with C2PA, and we support C2PA collaborating

- [00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXEVPH4YbeI&t=259) with Adobe, Microsoft, startups, and many others

- [00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXEVPH4YbeI&t=263) to build and implement standards that improve the transparency of digital media.

- [00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXEVPH4YbeI&t=270) Now, let's turn to the second and equally important part

- [00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXEVPH4YbeI&t=274) of our responsible AI approach,

- [00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXEVPH4YbeI&t=276) how we're building AI to benefit people and society.

- [00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXEVPH4YbeI&t=280) Today, our AI advances are helping to solve real-world problems

- [00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXEVPH4YbeI&t=284) like accelerating the work of 1.8 million scientists in 190 countries

- [00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXEVPH4YbeI&t=291) who are using AlphaFolds to work on issues like neglected diseases,

- [00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXEVPH4YbeI&t=296) helping predict floods in more than 80 countries,

- [00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXEVPH4YbeI&t=300) and helping organizations like the United Nations

- [00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXEVPH4YbeI&t=303) track progress on the world's 17 sustainable development goals

- [00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXEVPH4YbeI&t=307) with data commons.

- [00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXEVPH4YbeI&t=310) And now, generative AI is unlocking new ways

- [00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXEVPH4YbeI&t=313) for us to make the world's information and knowledge

- [00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXEVPH4YbeI&t=316) universally accessible and useful for learning.

- [00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXEVPH4YbeI&t=320) Billions of people already use Google products to learn every day,

- [00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXEVPH4YbeI&t=325) and generative AI is opening up new possibilities,

- [00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXEVPH4YbeI&t=328) allowing us to ask questions like,

- [00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXEVPH4YbeI&t=331) what if everyone everywhere could have their own personal AI tutor

- [00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXEVPH4YbeI&t=336) on any topic?

- [00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXEVPH4YbeI&t=338) Or, what if every educator could have their own assistant in the classroom?

- [00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXEVPH4YbeI&t=344) Today marks a new chapter for learning and education at Google.

- [00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXEVPH4YbeI&t=348) I'm excited to introduce LearnLM,

- [00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXEVPH4YbeI&t=352) our new family of models based on Gemini and fine-tuned for learning.

- [00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXEVPH4YbeI&t=359) LearnLM is grounded in educational research,

- [00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXEVPH4YbeI&t=362) making learning experiences more personal and engaging.

- [00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXEVPH4YbeI&t=367) And it's coming to the products you use every day,

- [00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXEVPH4YbeI&t=369) like Search, Android, Gemini, and YouTube.

- [00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXEVPH4YbeI&t=373) In fact, you've already seen LearnLM on stage today

- [00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXEVPH4YbeI&t=377) when it helped Samir with his son's homework on Android.

- [00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXEVPH4YbeI&t=381) Now, let's see how this works in the Gemini app.

- [00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXEVPH4YbeI&t=384) Earlier, SISI introduced gems, custom versions of Gemini

- [00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXEVPH4YbeI&t=389) that can act as personal assistive experts on any topic.

- [00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXEVPH4YbeI&t=395) We're developing some pre-made gems,

- [00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXEVPH4YbeI&t=397) which will be available in the Gemini app and web experience,

- [00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXEVPH4YbeI&t=401) including one called Learning Coach.

- [00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXEVPH4YbeI&t=404) With Learning Coach, you can get step-by-step study guidance

- [00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXEVPH4YbeI&t=408) along with helpful practice and memory techniques

- [00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXEVPH4YbeI&t=411) designed to build understanding rather than just give you the answer.

- [00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXEVPH4YbeI&t=417) Let's say you're a college student studying for an upcoming biology exam.

- [00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXEVPH4YbeI&t=421) If you need a tip to remember the formula for photosynthesis,

- [00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXEVPH4YbeI&t=425) Learning Coach can help.

- [00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXEVPH4YbeI&t=427) Learning Coach, along with other pre-made gems,

- [00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXEVPH4YbeI&t=430) will launch in Gemini in the coming months.

- [00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXEVPH4YbeI&t=434) And you can imagine what features like Gemini Live can unlock for learning.

- [00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXEVPH4YbeI&t=440) Another example is a new feature in YouTube

- [00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXEVPH4YbeI&t=443) that uses LearnLM to make educational videos more interactive,

- [00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXEVPH4YbeI&t=448) allowing you to ask a clarifying question,

- [00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXEVPH4YbeI&t=451) get a helpful explanation, or take a quiz.

- [00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXEVPH4YbeI&t=454) This even works for those long lectures or seminars,

- [00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXEVPH4YbeI&t=458) thanks to Gemini model's long context capabilities.

- [00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXEVPH4YbeI&t=462) This feature in YouTube is already rolling out to select Android users.

- [00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXEVPH4YbeI&t=468) As we work to extend LearnLM beyond our own products,

- [00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXEVPH4YbeI&t=472) we're partnering with experts and institutions like Columbia Teachers College,

- [00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXEVPH4YbeI&t=477) Arizona State University, and Khan Academy

- [00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXEVPH4YbeI&t=480) to test and improve the new capabilities in our models for learning.

- [00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXEVPH4YbeI&t=485) And we've collaborated with MIT RAISE to develop an online course

- [00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXEVPH4YbeI&t=490) to help educators better understand and use generative AI.

- [00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXEVPH4YbeI&t=495) We're also working directly with educators

- [00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXEVPH4YbeI&t=498) to build more helpful generative AI tools with LearnLM.

- [00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXEVPH4YbeI&t=501) For example, in Google Classroom,

- [00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXEVPH4YbeI&t=504) we're drawing on the advances we've heard about today

- [00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXEVPH4YbeI&t=507) to develop new ways to simplify and improve lesson planning

- [00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXEVPH4YbeI&t=512) and enable teachers to tailor lessons and content

- [00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXEVPH4YbeI&t=515) to meet the individual needs of their students.

- [00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXEVPH4YbeI&t=519) Standing here today makes me think back to my own time as an undergraduate.

- [00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXEVPH4YbeI&t=524) Then, AI was considered speculative, far from any real-world uses.

- [00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXEVPH4YbeI&t=530) Today, we can see how much is already real,

- [00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXEVPH4YbeI&t=534) how much it is already helping people from their everyday tasks

- [00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXEVPH4YbeI&t=538) to their most ambitious, productive, and imaginative endeavors,

- [00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXEVPH4YbeI&t=543) and how much more is still to come.

- [00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXEVPH4YbeI&t=545) This is what motivates us.

- [00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXEVPH4YbeI&t=547) I'm excited about what's ahead and what we'll build with all of you.

- [00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXEVPH4YbeI&t=551) Back to you, Sundar.

- [00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXEVPH4YbeI&t=556) Thanks, James.

- [00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXEVPH4YbeI&t=558) All of this shows the important progress we have made

- [00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXEVPH4YbeI&t=561) as we take a bold and responsible approach

- [00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXEVPH4YbeI&t=564) to making AI helpful for everyone.

- [00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXEVPH4YbeI&t=567) Before we wrap, I have a feeling that someone out there might be counting

- [00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXEVPH4YbeI&t=572) how many times we have mentioned AI today.

- [00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXEVPH4YbeI&t=575) Since a big team today has been letting Google do the work for you,

- [00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXEVPH4YbeI&t=583) we went ahead and counted so that you don't have to.

- [00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXEVPH4YbeI&t=599) That might be a record in how many times someone has said AI.

- [00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXEVPH4YbeI&t=606) I'm tempted to say it a few more times, but I won't.

- [00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXEVPH4YbeI&t=610) Anyhow, this tally is more than just a punchline.

- [00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXEVPH4YbeI&t=613) It reflects something much deeper.

- [00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXEVPH4YbeI&t=616) We've been AI-first in our approach for a long time.

- [00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXEVPH4YbeI&t=619) Our decades of research leadership have pioneered many of the modern breakthroughs

- [00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXEVPH4YbeI&t=624) that power AI progress for us and for the industry.

- [00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXEVPH4YbeI&t=627) On top of that, we have world-leading infrastructure built for the AI era,

- [00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXEVPH4YbeI&t=632) cutting-edge innovation and search now powered by Gemini,

- [00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXEVPH4YbeI&t=636) products that help at an extraordinary scale,

- [00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXEVPH4YbeI&t=639) including 15 products with over half a billion users,

- [00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXEVPH4YbeI&t=643) and platforms that enable everyone, partners, customers, creators,

- [00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXEVPH4YbeI&t=648) and all of you to invent the future.

- [00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXEVPH4YbeI&t=651) This progress is only possible because of our incredible developer community.

- [00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXEVPH4YbeI&t=656) You're making it real through the experiences you build every day.

- [00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXEVPH4YbeI&t=660) So to everyone here in Showline, and the millions more watching around the world,

- [00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXEVPH4YbeI&t=665) here's to the possibilities ahead and creating them together.

- [00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXEVPH4YbeI&t=668) Thank you.
