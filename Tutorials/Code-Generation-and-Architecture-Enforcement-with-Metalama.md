Did you know it’s common for a business application to contain 15% repetitive code – just because of meta-programming limitations in the C# language? Why write boilerplate manually when a machine could generate it on-the-fly when you compile? Discover Metalama, the new meta-programming framework for .NET.

Their C#-to-C# template language is simply amazing! Logging, caching, memento, observability… If it’s repetitive, Metalama can automate it.

### Video Transcription


- [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJDFXWRRuNQ&t=0) Say goodbye to the frustrations of repetitive&nbsp; code and the struggles of maintaining codebase&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJDFXWRRuNQ&t=6) consistency. Welcome to Metalama, the&nbsp; powerful meta- programming framework,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJDFXWRRuNQ&t=12) specifically designed to help you&nbsp; write clean and concise C# code.

- [00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJDFXWRRuNQ&t=19) I am Gael Fraiteur, the lead developer of&nbsp; Metalama, and in this video I will guide you&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJDFXWRRuNQ&t=25) through the three pillars that make Metalama&nbsp; an indispensable tool for any .NET project.

- [00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJDFXWRRuNQ&t=33) One, eliminate boilerplate code.

- [00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJDFXWRRuNQ&t=37) Two, enforce architectural guidelines.

- [00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJDFXWRRuNQ&t=41) And three, deploy custom code fixes.

- [00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJDFXWRRuNQ&t=47) Dealing with repetitive code can be&nbsp; frustrating. It often seems like it&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJDFXWRRuNQ&t=52) could be generated by an algorithm. However, the&nbsp; pattern cannot be abstracted just using standard&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJDFXWRRuNQ&t=60) C#. Metalama's first pillar provides an&nbsp; effective solution to that problem: aspects.

- [00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJDFXWRRuNQ&t=70) Aspects are special meta C# classes&nbsp; that operate within the compiler and&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJDFXWRRuNQ&t=77) the IDE. They can modify or add behaviors&nbsp; to existing code. "meta.Target" gives you&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJDFXWRRuNQ&t=86) access to the details of the context&nbsp; to which your aspect will be applied,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJDFXWRRuNQ&t=91) and " meta.Proceed" is replaced by&nbsp; the original method implementation.

- [00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJDFXWRRuNQ&t=97) You can then add the aspect to any method in the&nbsp; same way that you would add any other attribute.

- [00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJDFXWRRuNQ&t=104) When you run the program, you can&nbsp; see that logging has been applied.

- [00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJDFXWRRuNQ&t=110) You can compare your source code with&nbsp; the executed code with just two clicks.

- [00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJDFXWRRuNQ&t=116) Metalama templates are pure C#&nbsp; and they are incredibly flexible.

- [00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJDFXWRRuNQ&t=121) For instance, you can build an interpolated&nbsp; string that includes parameter values.

- [00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJDFXWRRuNQ&t=127) But adding an attribute to every single&nbsp; logged method can be tedious. Enter fabrics,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJDFXWRRuNQ&t=134) compile-time classes that add aspects to multiple&nbsp; methods with a single line of LINQ-style code.

- [00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJDFXWRRuNQ&t=142) Metalama integrates with CodeLens.&nbsp; It shows you precisely which aspects&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJDFXWRRuNQ&t=147) have been applied to your source code,&nbsp; even when there is no aspect attribute.

- [00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJDFXWRRuNQ&t=153) Metalama allows you to&nbsp; implement many other patterns,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJDFXWRRuNQ&t=157) such as caching, exception handling,&nbsp; NotifyPropertyChanged, and many more.

- [00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJDFXWRRuNQ&t=164) But there is more you can do&nbsp; to improve your productivity.

- [00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJDFXWRRuNQ&t=168) In large projects, it can be challenging&nbsp; to ensure everyone follows patterns and&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJDFXWRRuNQ&t=173) conventions. While standard tools help with code&nbsp; formatting and industry-wide best practices,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJDFXWRRuNQ&t=182) it can be tricky to enforce architectural&nbsp; guidelines that are specific to your project.

- [00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJDFXWRRuNQ&t=188) Here comes Metalama's architecture validation.&nbsp; With Metalama, implement your own rules and&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJDFXWRRuNQ&t=196) discover the power of Architecture as Code. You&nbsp; can use fabrics to validate entire namespaces or&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJDFXWRRuNQ&t=202) class hierarchies, or use custom attributes&nbsp; to target individual classes or members.

- [00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJDFXWRRuNQ&t=210) Architectural rules are verified in&nbsp; real time within the IDE so you get&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJDFXWRRuNQ&t=216) immediate feedback and don't&nbsp; need to wait for code reviews.

- [00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJDFXWRRuNQ&t=221) And of course, rules are also enforced&nbsp; during the build and can be a part of&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJDFXWRRuNQ&t=227) your PR requirements, so&nbsp; you can merge confidently.

- [00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJDFXWRRuNQ&t=232) Metalama provides several open- source&nbsp; architecture rules out of the box,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJDFXWRRuNQ&t=237) and you can build your own with&nbsp; familiar reflection -like API.

- [00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJDFXWRRuNQ&t=242) Thanks to coded architecture&nbsp; verification, you can keep&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJDFXWRRuNQ&t=245) your codebase aligned with implementation&nbsp; guidelines and reduce unwanted complexity.

- [00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJDFXWRRuNQ&t=252) After exploring aspects and&nbsp; real time code verification,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJDFXWRRuNQ&t=258) let's delve into Metalama's third pillar:&nbsp; bespoke code fixes and live templates.

- [00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJDFXWRRuNQ&t=265) We all love code fixes. They&nbsp; spare us from tedious typing&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJDFXWRRuNQ&t=270) and help us stay in the zone eliminating&nbsp; constant documentation lookups.

- [00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJDFXWRRuNQ&t=277) With Metalama, you can build code fixes and&nbsp; refactorings that are specific to your project.

- [00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJDFXWRRuNQ&t=284) You can turn any aspect into a live&nbsp; template. This gives you incredible&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJDFXWRRuNQ&t=288) power to craft complex refactorings with ease.

- [00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJDFXWRRuNQ&t=294) The days of dealing with cumbersome&nbsp; boilerplate code are over. By harnessing&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJDFXWRRuNQ&t=299) the power of aspects and fabrics, you can&nbsp; avoid thousands of redundant lines of codes,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJDFXWRRuNQ&t=305) reduce architecture erosion, and&nbsp; provide coding assistance to your team.
