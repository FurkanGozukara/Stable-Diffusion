### Video Transcription


- [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOVEcvn5h-0&t=0) Greetings everyone. This is a special Patreon exclusive video.&nbsp;

- [00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOVEcvn5h-0&t=3) In this video, I will show how to install&nbsp; latest Auto1111, latest libraries and DreamBooth&nbsp;

- [00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOVEcvn5h-0&t=10) extension on RunPod.io pods. So let's open our RunPod account.&nbsp;

- [00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOVEcvn5h-0&t=14) You can also register from this link. Let's open it, login.&nbsp;

- [00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOVEcvn5h-0&t=20) Let's select our pod.&nbsp;

- [00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOVEcvn5h-0&t=22) I prefer community cloud and I&nbsp; prefer over 20GB VRAM having GPUs.&nbsp;

- [00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOVEcvn5h-0&t=27) For example, RTX 3090, which&nbsp; is very decent, only 29 cents.&nbsp;

- [00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOVEcvn5h-0&t=32) Select your template from here. Make sure that you have&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOVEcvn5h-0&t=35) selected Web Automatic 8.0.3. It can be higher version when you are&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOVEcvn5h-0&t=40) watching this, but it still should work. You can also customize your RunPod.&nbsp;

- [00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOVEcvn5h-0&t=46) For example, let's make it&nbsp; 110GB, set override, continue.&nbsp;

- [00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOVEcvn5h-0&t=49) You can also use advanced and bidding, but&nbsp; I don't suggest that for training because&nbsp;

- [00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOVEcvn5h-0&t=55) it can just turn it off if&nbsp; someone else overbids you.&nbsp;

- [00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOVEcvn5h-0&t=59) So let's wait until the&nbsp; Connect button appears here.&nbsp;

- [00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOVEcvn5h-0&t=63) OK, Connect button appeared. Let's connect to our JupyterLab.&nbsp;

- [00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOVEcvn5h-0&t=68) The installation is so easy. Just download these two scripts&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOVEcvn5h-0&t=72) by clicking on them. OK.&nbsp;

- [00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOVEcvn5h-0&t=74) Not loaded yet. Let's refresh.&nbsp;

- [00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOVEcvn5h-0&t=76) By the way, if you want to share your RunPod&nbsp; with someone else, right click here, copy&nbsp;

- [00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOVEcvn5h-0&t=80) link and share that link. With that way someone else can also connect your JupyterLab.&nbsp;

- [00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOVEcvn5h-0&t=85) OK, still not started. Sometimes it is taking time.&nbsp;

- [00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOVEcvn5h-0&t=90) Sometimes some machines are also being broken&nbsp; and you are being need to start a new machine.&nbsp;

- [00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOVEcvn5h-0&t=96) OK, it is started. The first thing we need to do is&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOVEcvn5h-0&t=100) changing python relauncher.py. So I prepared this GitHub readme file&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOVEcvn5h-0&t=105) because it is easier here to copy. So I copied this.&nbsp;

- [00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOVEcvn5h-0&t=110) Got your JupyterLab, got your python relauncher.py&nbsp; here, you see, just change this part, save&nbsp;

- [00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOVEcvn5h-0&t=119) and restart your pod. This is only one time.&nbsp;

- [00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOVEcvn5h-0&t=121) You don't need to do this again and again. Let's just wait until it is getting restarted.&nbsp;

- [00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOVEcvn5h-0&t=128) You can refresh this page and&nbsp; see if it is restarted or not.&nbsp;

- [00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOVEcvn5h-0&t=132) Not still yet. OK, let's try to connect again.&nbsp;

- [00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOVEcvn5h-0&t=135) OK, restart has been completed. Go to your workspace folder.&nbsp;

- [00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOVEcvn5h-0&t=141) I am inside workspace. Upload your files.&nbsp;

- [00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOVEcvn5h-0&t=144) Go to download, select the files downloaded,&nbsp; upload them, open a new terminal in here inside&nbsp;

- [00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOVEcvn5h-0&t=151) workspace. You see currently I am inside workspace.&nbsp;

- [00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOVEcvn5h-0&t=154) Copy the first command. Paste and hit enter.&nbsp;

- [00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOVEcvn5h-0&t=158) Be patient until the Auto1111 restarts.&nbsp;

- [00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOVEcvn5h-0&t=164) This is the script. It deletes the venv.&nbsp;

- [00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOVEcvn5h-0&t=167) It downloads the latest files. It install the latest CUDA DLL.&nbsp;

- [00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOVEcvn5h-0&t=171) It is also downloading the best&nbsp; VAE file automatically for you.&nbsp;

- [00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOVEcvn5h-0&t=175) You see, it is automatically installing&nbsp; the latest cuDNN files.&nbsp;

- [00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOVEcvn5h-0&t=180) This is significantly improving the speed. When you see this running on local URL,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOVEcvn5h-0&t=186) it means that the first part of installation has been completed.&nbsp;

- [00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOVEcvn5h-0&t=189) Let's open a new terminal. Let's copy the second command.&nbsp;

- [00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOVEcvn5h-0&t=194) Paste it. Hit enter.&nbsp;

- [00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOVEcvn5h-0&t=196) Then it will install the&nbsp; second part of the script.&nbsp;

- [00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOVEcvn5h-0&t=200) And it will automatically&nbsp; launch the newest web UI.&nbsp;

- [00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOVEcvn5h-0&t=206) You see, it is installing&nbsp; everything automatically.&nbsp;

- [00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOVEcvn5h-0&t=208) You don't need to do anything. The installation is completed&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOVEcvn5h-0&t=211) and the web UI started. Let's connect with 3000 port.&nbsp;

- [00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOVEcvn5h-0&t=216) OK, it is started. You see the DreamBooth extension is here.&nbsp;

- [00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOVEcvn5h-0&t=221) Moreover, we have now Torch 2.0.1 version&nbsp; with CUDA 11.8 and xFormers 0.0.20.&nbsp;

- [00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOVEcvn5h-0&t=230) Let's check out the speed. Moreover, I also have installed&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOVEcvn5h-0&t=235) automatically this VAE file. So let's also apply that.&nbsp;

- [00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOVEcvn5h-0&t=239) OK, let's go to the speed fast car. Let's make it like that.&nbsp;

- [00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOVEcvn5h-0&t=245) And let's see the speed. You see we are reaching over 19 IT per second&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOVEcvn5h-0&t=251) with RTX 3090 GPU. This is amazing speed for this GPU.&nbsp;

- [00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOVEcvn5h-0&t=258) Then let's say you wanted to&nbsp; restart your web UI for any reason.&nbsp;

- [00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOVEcvn5h-0&t=263) You could be have turned off your Pod. You want to refresh your web UI.&nbsp;

- [00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOVEcvn5h-0&t=268) So copy this command. Open a new terminal anywhere here.&nbsp;

- [00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOVEcvn5h-0&t=274) Copy paste it. And it will kill the previous&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOVEcvn5h-0&t=277) instance and it will restart your web UI. You see it has killed the previous instance&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOVEcvn5h-0&t=282) and it is restarting again. I will also demonstrate after&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOVEcvn5h-0&t=286) turning off Pod and turning it on. So the web UI instance restarted.&nbsp;

- [00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOVEcvn5h-0&t=291) Let me also show you. I will stop this Pod.&nbsp;

- [00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOVEcvn5h-0&t=294) By the way, if you delete the pod,&nbsp; then it will get permanently deleted.&nbsp;

- [00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOVEcvn5h-0&t=298) Otherwise, it won't be. I deleted this pod.&nbsp;

- [00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOVEcvn5h-0&t=301) Then stop pod. Start it again.&nbsp;

- [00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOVEcvn5h-0&t=304) So after you stop your pod and start it again&nbsp; or after you restart it, it will automatically&nbsp;

- [00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOVEcvn5h-0&t=309) start a new web UI instance, but you won't&nbsp; be able to see its command line arguments.&nbsp;

- [00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOVEcvn5h-0&t=316) Its command line interface. So what we are going to do is we will kill&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOVEcvn5h-0&t=320) the initial started web UI instance and we will start it again.&nbsp;

- [00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOVEcvn5h-0&t=324) I will now demonstrate it after&nbsp; the connect button appears.&nbsp;

- [00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOVEcvn5h-0&t=327) OK, connect button appeared. Let's connect to JupyterLab.&nbsp;

- [00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOVEcvn5h-0&t=330) You see, I already have an instance of web UI. It is started, but I won't see what is happening.&nbsp;

- [00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOVEcvn5h-0&t=337) So I open a new terminal, copy&nbsp; the command here, paste it here.&nbsp;

- [00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOVEcvn5h-0&t=343) Then it will start a new instance and&nbsp; I will be able to see everything here.&nbsp;

- [00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOVEcvn5h-0&t=348) OK, it is getting started. OK, it is started.&nbsp;

- [00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOVEcvn5h-0&t=351) Let's refresh. Now we will see what is happening here.&nbsp;

- [00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOVEcvn5h-0&t=354) This is very useful when you&nbsp; are doing training, especially.&nbsp;

- [00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOVEcvn5h-0&t=358) Fast car generate.&nbsp;

- [00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOVEcvn5h-0&t=363) And it has started and I am&nbsp; seeing whatever is happening.&nbsp;

- [00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOVEcvn5h-0&t=366) And you see, it is almost&nbsp; reaching 20 it per second.&nbsp;

- [00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOVEcvn5h-0&t=370) This is very, very good 19.5 it per second. This is all for today.&nbsp;

- [00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOVEcvn5h-0&t=377) I hope you have enjoyed.&nbsp;

- [00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOVEcvn5h-0&t=378) Please keep supporting me and&nbsp; ask me any questions you want.&nbsp;
