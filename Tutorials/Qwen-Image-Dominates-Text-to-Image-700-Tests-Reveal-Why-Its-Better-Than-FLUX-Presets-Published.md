### Video Transcription


- [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6h02YY6gUs&t=0) Greetings everyone. Today I'm going to introduce&nbsp; you to Qwen Image, which is the newest king of&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6h02YY6gUs&t=6) the text-to-image models. When I say king, it&nbsp; is not an exaggeration. This is the newest,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6h02YY6gUs&t=14) very best model to generate images from&nbsp; text prompts. And how I am sure of it?&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6h02YY6gUs&t=22) I have done over 700 generations of Qwen&nbsp; Image and compared the very best presets&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6h02YY6gUs&t=31) of this model with FLUX Dev and FLUX&nbsp; Krea model. Preparation of the very&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6h02YY6gUs&t=38) best workflow for this model took a lot&nbsp; of time, but the results are mind-blowing.

- [00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6h02YY6gUs&t=45) This model, Qwen Image, produces better&nbsp; images than the FLUX base dev model in&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6h02YY6gUs&t=52) every case. Moreover, when it comes to&nbsp; understanding complex scenes and prompts,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6h02YY6gUs&t=59) this model is unchallenged. The only weak side&nbsp; of this model is that currently, it is not as&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6h02YY6gUs&t=65) realistic as FLUX Krea model, but other than that,&nbsp; in every case, this model produces amazing images.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6h02YY6gUs&t=75) To make it easy for you, I have prepared one-click&nbsp; to download these models and one-click to apply&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6h02YY6gUs&t=84) presets and right away use it. You see, currently&nbsp; I am generating some random images real-time and&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6h02YY6gUs&t=91) they are just excellent quality. And I even&nbsp; didn't write the prompts of these images. How&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6h02YY6gUs&t=97) I made these prompts will surprise you. It is just&nbsp; so easy and so elegant, and it is working amazing.

- [00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6h02YY6gUs&t=106) All of these images are real-time being generated&nbsp; and you are seeing them as they are generated.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6h02YY6gUs&t=113) It is not, of course, too fast because it is a&nbsp; big model, but since we are using SwarmUI with&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6h02YY6gUs&t=120) ComfyUI backend, as long as you have sufficient&nbsp; amount of RAM memory, you will be able to generate&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6h02YY6gUs&t=127) amazing images even on low VRAM GPUs. You see,&nbsp; these are the previews of the images that are&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6h02YY6gUs&t=134) being generated and as they get generated, we will&nbsp; see them. For example, this is another new image.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6h02YY6gUs&t=141) This is another amazing image. This is another&nbsp; amazing image. I mean, look at this detail.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6h02YY6gUs&t=147) Look at the anatomy, the accuracy, everything is&nbsp; just perfect. You see, this is the tail and this&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6h02YY6gUs&t=154) is a full dragon. I mean, dragons are not even&nbsp; real. However, this model knows it very well.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6h02YY6gUs&t=161) And this is a warrior challenging to the dragon.&nbsp; I mean, look at this image. Look at the quality.

- [00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6h02YY6gUs&t=168) This model is unchallenged, and this&nbsp; is just released. With the fine-tuning,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6h02YY6gUs&t=173) with the new LoRAs, this model will get only&nbsp; better. And look at the contrast. It is able&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6h02YY6gUs&t=180) to generate two completely different images in a&nbsp; single image like this. And I even didn't write&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6h02YY6gUs&t=186) the prompts. They are all automatic generations,&nbsp; and I'm going to show you how I made it right now.

- [00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6h02YY6gUs&t=194) I just uploaded the images from CivitAI. You see,&nbsp; like this, and I gave this prompt: "Write prompt&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6h02YY6gUs&t=202) for each attached image and separate each prompt&nbsp; with this." Whatever you want, you can make it new&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6h02YY6gUs&t=207) line, but the key thing here is that I am using&nbsp; Video Models Prompt Generate guidance, which I&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6h02YY6gUs&t=214) have introduced you in the previous video. So,&nbsp; how you are going to use this model in SwarmUI?&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6h02YY6gUs&t=221) If you have watched our latest tutorial about Wan&nbsp; 2.2, you already know, but if you haven't yet,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6h02YY6gUs&t=228) I recommend to watch it. For installation of&nbsp; SwarmUI and ComfyUI, we have this tutorial.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6h02YY6gUs&t=234) Both of them will be in the description of the&nbsp; video, so you will be able to quickly find it.

- [00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6h02YY6gUs&t=240) So, all you need to do is install them&nbsp; and use our newest zip file. Our newest&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6h02YY6gUs&t=247) zip file is located here. The link will be in&nbsp; the description of the video. Download SwarmUI&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6h02YY6gUs&t=252) Model Downloader version 62. As usual, extract&nbsp; it into your previous installation folder or&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6h02YY6gUs&t=260) wherever you want to install. Right-click, I will&nbsp; use this one, extract here, override files. Then,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6h02YY6gUs&t=267) this is super important. To be able to use this&nbsp; new model, you need to update your ComfyUI and&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6h02YY6gUs&t=274) SwarmUI. For updating ComfyUI, I will use Windows&nbsp; Update ComfyUI, as usual, and it will update it&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6h02YY6gUs&t=280) automatically for me. Don't forget that. Then, you&nbsp; also need to update SwarmUI. For SwarmUI updating,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6h02YY6gUs&t=288) we have Windows Update SwarmUI, and this will&nbsp; update my SwarmUI as usual. If you are first-time&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6h02YY6gUs&t=295) installing, watch those tutorials, but if you&nbsp; already followed our requirements tutorial,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6h02YY6gUs&t=301) all you need to do is just Windows install&nbsp; for ComfyUI and Windows install SwarmUI.

- [00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6h02YY6gUs&t=307) Once your SwarmUI starts, you need to import new&nbsp; presets. You see, there is "Import Preset." This&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6h02YY6gUs&t=314) is important. It is not automatically imported.&nbsp; So, choose file, go back to your extraction of&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6h02YY6gUs&t=320) your zip file, and you will see that there is&nbsp; "Amazing SwarmUI Presets Version 9." Select it,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6h02YY6gUs&t=327) overwrite and import. Then you will get these two&nbsp; presets: Qwen Image Realism Fast and Qwen Image&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6h02YY6gUs&t=335) High Quality. Then all you need to do is&nbsp; just quick tools, reset params to default,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6h02YY6gUs&t=340) direct apply, and type your prompt. That's it.&nbsp; Or direct apply and type your prompt. You see,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6h02YY6gUs&t=346) Qwen Image High Quality also has default&nbsp; negative prompts. However, Qwen Image Realism&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6h02YY6gUs&t=353) Fast doesn't have it because it is using CFG scale&nbsp; 1. Therefore, the negative prompts is not working.

- [00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6h02YY6gUs&t=359) And exactly, I am using that preset right&nbsp; now. The selected preset is Qwen Image&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6h02YY6gUs&t=366) High Quality. It is generating, you see, new&nbsp; images are being generated as I am recording&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6h02YY6gUs&t=372) this video and as we are watching it.&nbsp; Amazing quality. Prompt following,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6h02YY6gUs&t=378) the prompt understanding of&nbsp; this model is just mind-blowing.

- [00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6h02YY6gUs&t=381) So, what about the models that you need&nbsp; to download? To download the models,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6h02YY6gUs&t=385) you need to double-click "Windows Start&nbsp; Download Models Up.bat" file and start&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6h02YY6gUs&t=390) it. Never run any of my installers as&nbsp; administrator. Always run them with&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6h02YY6gUs&t=397) double-clicking. Do not forget that. It will&nbsp; install necessary libraries and start the newest&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6h02YY6gUs&t=402) version of our downloader, which is SwarmUI&nbsp; Model Downloader version 62. And in here,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6h02YY6gUs&t=408) all you need to do is go to SwarmUI bundles&nbsp; and Qwen Image Core bundle. Download it. This&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6h02YY6gUs&t=415) will download the Qwen Image GGUF Q8 model,&nbsp; Qwen necessary clip model, and Qwen VAE file.

- [00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6h02YY6gUs&t=425) If your VRAM is low and if you don't&nbsp; want to use block swapping a lot,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6h02YY6gUs&t=429) what you can do? Go to image generation models,&nbsp; go to Qwen image models and download Qwen Image&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6h02YY6gUs&t=435) Q4 GGUF file. You see these are the sizes.&nbsp; This model quality is also excellent. However,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6h02YY6gUs&t=442) if you have sufficient amount of RAM&nbsp; memory, you can use Q8 and not lose&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6h02YY6gUs&t=447) any quality. The SwarmUI will just work good with&nbsp; automatic block swapping of the ComfyUI backend.

- [00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6h02YY6gUs&t=454) Currently, if you use --use-sage-attention, it may&nbsp; fail. So, try with it. If you get black output,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6h02YY6gUs&t=462) just remove it because it is getting updated. It&nbsp; is not fully working yet. So, this optimization&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6h02YY6gUs&t=468) may cause black output. Moreover, in the server&nbsp; configuration, in the very bottom, if you get&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6h02YY6gUs&t=475) black outputs, disable this "Allow GPU-specific&nbsp; optimizations." The team of ComfyUI is working to&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6h02YY6gUs&t=482) fix these issues. It could be fixed when you are&nbsp; watching this, but I am just letting you know.

- [00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6h02YY6gUs&t=487) One another restriction of this model is that&nbsp; the resolution has to be divisible to 16. Its&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6h02YY6gUs&t=494) default resolution is 1328 to 1328, so it&nbsp; is about 70% bigger than the FLUX model. So,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6h02YY6gUs&t=503) when we fine-tune or when we LoRA this model,&nbsp; hopefully, it is coming very soon hopefully,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6h02YY6gUs&t=510) it will be able to learn much more details than&nbsp; the FLUX itself because it has a better base&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6h02YY6gUs&t=516) resolution. And you see the quality is amazing.&nbsp; The realism is not there yet, but when we&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6h02YY6gUs&t=522) fine-tune or when we LoRA train, it will be there.&nbsp; I am pretty sure. However, this is the new leader&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6h02YY6gUs&t=528) of the image generation models from text. And&nbsp; when I say that, I am not exaggerating or I am&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6h02YY6gUs&t=535) not saying it out of nothing. When you follow&nbsp; the post, the link will be in the description&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6h02YY6gUs&t=540) of the video, you will see that I have shared the&nbsp; grid tests that I have made. You need to put them&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6h02YY6gUs&t=546) into your SwarmUI &gt; output &gt; local &gt; grids. When&nbsp; you put them here, they will be ready to follow.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6h02YY6gUs&t=554) And then restart your SwarmUI, go to Tools &gt;&nbsp; Grid Generator, and load grid config, and you&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6h02YY6gUs&t=560) will see the grids here. There are lots of grids,&nbsp; not only this one. When you download it, you will&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6h02YY6gUs&t=566) see lots of grids like here. You see Qwen Image&nbsp; and other ones. You see, I did massive number of&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6h02YY6gUs&t=572) grid testing, and this is just one of them. And&nbsp; after analyzing all the results, I came up with&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6h02YY6gUs&t=579) these presets. So, this was a huge work done by&nbsp; me. So, you can also analyze every image, every&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6h02YY6gUs&t=586) configuration that I have tested yourself on your&nbsp; computer with highest quality and see yourself.

- [00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6h02YY6gUs&t=593) Furthermore, this model is amazing at&nbsp; writing text. You see, "New King Image&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6h02YY6gUs&t=602) Models Qwen has arrived." This is how I have&nbsp; generated the thumbnail of this video. So,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6h02YY6gUs&t=610) this is the new thumbnail generation, if you ask&nbsp; my opinion. And what I did was extremely lazy.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6h02YY6gUs&t=617) I just added this to the random prompts. Let me&nbsp; show you. So, with a better approach, you can get&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6h02YY6gUs&t=625) even better text. The image has the following text&nbsp; with an amazing 3D font: "New King of Image Models&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6h02YY6gUs&t=632) Qwen has arrived." And then I just added the other&nbsp; prompts. So, this is a very lazy way of working.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6h02YY6gUs&t=640) And if you look at the final prompt, it is like&nbsp; this. Let me show you so you will see what I&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6h02YY6gUs&t=646) mean. The image has the following text with&nbsp; an amazing 3D font, blah blah blah. You see,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6h02YY6gUs&t=651) this is a very lazy way of writing the prompt&nbsp; and even at this way, it is able to generate&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6h02YY6gUs&t=658) amazing images. I mean, look at the beauty of this&nbsp; text written on the image. This is just amazing.

- [00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6h02YY6gUs&t=664) In some cases, it is failing to write "Qwen"&nbsp; accurately, probably because it is not an&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6h02YY6gUs&t=669) English word. However, as you try more, you&nbsp; will get the perfect text like this. And this&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6h02YY6gUs&t=676) is another one. I mean, look at this. It is also&nbsp; matching the text color and style with the rest of&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6h02YY6gUs&t=683) the image as well. Making something like this&nbsp; would take a lot of time, but now with Qwen,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6h02YY6gUs&t=690) we can have amazing images with a beautiful&nbsp; text written on them like this. So, with Qwen,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6h02YY6gUs&t=697) now you can generate your thumbnails with&nbsp; just prompting and not spending any time.

- [00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6h02YY6gUs&t=703) And finally, I have compared my very&nbsp; best preset of FLUX Dev, FLUX Krea Dev,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6h02YY6gUs&t=711) Qwen Image Realism Fast, and Qwen Image High&nbsp; Quality. So when we analyze the results, FLUX Dev&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6h02YY6gUs&t=717) is inferior to Qwen image at every case, whatever&nbsp; you can think of. The FLUX Krea Dev has better&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6h02YY6gUs&t=724) realism at certain prompts than the Qwen. I can&nbsp; say that. For example, we see that FLUX Krea has&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6h02YY6gUs&t=731) a better realism, as you can see, than the Qwen&nbsp; Realism or Qwen Highest Quality. But you know the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6h02YY6gUs&t=738) resolution is 70% lower than the Qwen image. For&nbsp; example, this is not a very realistic scene. We&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6h02YY6gUs&t=745) can say that at this scene, the Qwen is just much&nbsp; better. At anime, again, Qwen image shines. And we&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6h02YY6gUs&t=753) can say that when it comes to not very realistic&nbsp; images like dinosaurs, which we do not have any&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6h02YY6gUs&t=758) realistic image, again, the Qwen shines. You see,&nbsp; this is much better than the FLUX Krea, and it is&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6h02YY6gUs&t=766) much more accurate. Or this is like a 3D scene.&nbsp; Again, the Qwen is shining, much, much better.

- [00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6h02YY6gUs&t=773) But when we come to the human, FLUX Dev is, as we&nbsp; know, it is not very good. FLUX Krea is excellent,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6h02YY6gUs&t=779) shines at the human, and Qwen is not there yet.&nbsp; I mean, the realism is not there yet for humans,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6h02YY6gUs&t=786) but the base is so good. So with LoRAs, which&nbsp; I assume they will pop anytime, it will get&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6h02YY6gUs&t=793) much better, or with just fine-tuning. But when it&nbsp; comes to understanding prompts, it shines. I mean,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6h02YY6gUs&t=799) look at this prompt. Just pause the video and read&nbsp; it. This is FLUX Dev. Look at this. This is FLUX&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6h02YY6gUs&t=805) Krea. I mean, nothing like that. And this is Qwen&nbsp; Realism, and this is Qwen High Quality. Qwen High&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6h02YY6gUs&t=814) Quality is just mind-blowing. It is able to follow&nbsp; the prompt amazingly. It is just so perfect.

- [00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6h02YY6gUs&t=820) I shared these grids, they are in the post, they&nbsp; are public, you don't need to be even subscribers,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6h02YY6gUs&t=825) so you can just download and look at your&nbsp; computer. Again, this is a realism-related&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6h02YY6gUs&t=830) prompt, and the FLUX Dev, as we know,&nbsp; not very good. FLUX Krea, really good,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6h02YY6gUs&t=837) realistic. Qwen Realism preset we prepared,&nbsp; it is also pretty decent at this prompt,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6h02YY6gUs&t=843) and this is Qwen High Quality.&nbsp; The realism is not there yet.

- [00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6h02YY6gUs&t=847) Hopefully, I will make a full tutorial and a&nbsp; very easy-to-use graphical user interface to&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6h02YY6gUs&t=852) train Qwen with Kohya's Musubi Tuner. Kohya is&nbsp; working on that, and we will be able to generate&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6h02YY6gUs&t=859) amazing LoRAs and amazing fine-tunes from Qwen.&nbsp; I am pretty confidently saying to you that this&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6h02YY6gUs&t=866) is our new very best text-to-image model which we&nbsp; will use from this moment. And let's see some of&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6h02YY6gUs&t=874) the more generations that have been completed.&nbsp; Currently, I am on vacation, therefore I am not&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6h02YY6gUs&t=880) on my regular computer. So, I am using Vast.ai&nbsp; compute to generate these images. But you know&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6h02YY6gUs&t=886) I have covered all of them. You can use Vast.ai&nbsp; compute, you can use RunPod, you can use your own&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6h02YY6gUs&t=891) local GPU, and it will work very well because&nbsp; we are using ComfyUI backend and therefore,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6h02YY6gUs&t=898) it is fully optimized, working amazing. And the&nbsp; image quality is just mind-blowing. We don't see&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6h02YY6gUs&t=905) anatomy errors, we don't see, you know, other&nbsp; things that shouldn't be there. I mean, look at&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6h02YY6gUs&t=910) this. The foot is accurate, you see? Look at this.&nbsp; The fingers are accurate. I mean, everything is&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6h02YY6gUs&t=917) accurate. This is just an amazing model, believe&nbsp; me. You will love this model. So therefore,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6h02YY6gUs&t=922) I'm recommending you to try this model, and I am&nbsp; pretty sure that it will be your new best model.

- [00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6h02YY6gUs&t=928) Hopefully, see you in future tutorial videos. Ask&nbsp; me any questions from Patreon, from YouTube reply,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6h02YY6gUs&t=934) join our Discord channel. I am expecting you&nbsp; there. All of them is just available to you&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6h02YY6gUs&t=940) publicly. And the new images are coming. So if&nbsp; you are wondering how I am generating these random&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6h02YY6gUs&t=945) things, I went to the wildcards and generated&nbsp; with wildcard, you see? Every line becomes a new&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6h02YY6gUs&t=952) prompt. This is how it works. So it is generating&nbsp; them like this. So in the prompt, I just typed&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6h02YY6gUs&t=958) it. When you click it, it adds it to there, and&nbsp; it will randomly pick a prompt and generate it.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6h02YY6gUs&t=966) You see? So good. Okay, this is another good&nbsp; image. I mean, really good, really, really.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6h02YY6gUs&t=971) And this is another one. The composition, the&nbsp; complex prompt following, it is just perfect.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6h02YY6gUs&t=978) So when we fine-tune this model with ourselves or&nbsp; our art set, style, I think it will be amazing.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6h02YY6gUs&t=986) And I am hoping that this model also will be able&nbsp; to learn multiple subjects, multiple person at a&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6h02YY6gUs&t=993) time. So we will see. And this is the thing that&nbsp; I did. Seed -1, 999 images and just generate. When&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6h02YY6gUs&t=1003) I click just generate, it generates. Okay,&nbsp; thank you so much. Hopefully, see you later.
