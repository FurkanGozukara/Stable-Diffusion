### Video Transcription


- [00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrBS9rcIcWk&t=9) Hi everyone. I'm James.&nbsp;

- [00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrBS9rcIcWk&t=12) In addition to research, I lead a new area&nbsp; at Google called technology and society.&nbsp;

- [00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrBS9rcIcWk&t=20) Growing up in Zimbabwe, I could not have imagined&nbsp; all the amazing and groundbreaking innovations&nbsp;

- [00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrBS9rcIcWk&t=26) that have been presented on this stage today. While I feel it's important to celebrate the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrBS9rcIcWk&t=33) incredible progress in AI and the immense potential that it has for people and society&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrBS9rcIcWk&t=38) everywhere, we must also acknowledge that it's an emerging technology that is still being&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrBS9rcIcWk&t=44) developed and there's still so much more to do.&nbsp;

- [00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrBS9rcIcWk&t=49) Earlier you heard Sundar say that our approach&nbsp; to AI must be both bold and responsible.&nbsp;

- [00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrBS9rcIcWk&t=56) While there's a natural tension between the&nbsp; two, we believe it's not only possible but&nbsp;

- [00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrBS9rcIcWk&t=63) in fact critical to embrace&nbsp; that tension productively.&nbsp;

- [00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrBS9rcIcWk&t=68) The only way to be truly bold in the long&nbsp; term is to be responsible from the start.&nbsp;

- [00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrBS9rcIcWk&t=75) Our field defining research is helping scientists&nbsp; make bold advances in many scientific fields,&nbsp;

- [00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrBS9rcIcWk&t=82) including medical breakthroughs. Take for example Google DeepMind's AlphaFold,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrBS9rcIcWk&t=87) which can accurately predict the 3D shapes of 200 million proteins.&nbsp;

- [00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrBS9rcIcWk&t=93) That's nearly all the catalogue&nbsp; proteins known to science.&nbsp;

- [00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrBS9rcIcWk&t=97) AlphaFold gave us the equivalent of nearly&nbsp; 400 million years of progress in just weeks.&nbsp;

- [00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrBS9rcIcWk&t=112) So far more than one million researchers around&nbsp; the world have used AlphaFold's predictions,&nbsp;

- [00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrBS9rcIcWk&t=118) including Feng Xiang's pioneering lab at&nbsp; the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard.&nbsp;

- [00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrBS9rcIcWk&t=128) In fact in March this year, Zhang and his&nbsp; colleagues at MIT announced that they'd used&nbsp;

- [00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrBS9rcIcWk&t=135) AlphaFold to develop a novel molecular syringe&nbsp; which could deliver drugs to help improve&nbsp;

- [00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrBS9rcIcWk&t=141) the effectiveness of treatments&nbsp; for diseases like cancer.&nbsp;

- [00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrBS9rcIcWk&t=152) And while it's exhilarating to see such bold&nbsp; and beneficial breakthroughs, AI also has&nbsp;

- [00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrBS9rcIcWk&t=159) the potential to worsen existing societal&nbsp; challenges like unfair bias, as well as pose&nbsp;

- [00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrBS9rcIcWk&t=166) new challenges as it becomes more&nbsp; advanced and new uses emerge.&nbsp;

- [00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrBS9rcIcWk&t=171) That's why we believe it's imperative&nbsp; to take a responsible approach to AI.&nbsp;

- [00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrBS9rcIcWk&t=177) This work centers around our AI principles&nbsp; that we first established in 2018.&nbsp;

- [00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrBS9rcIcWk&t=183) These principles guide product development&nbsp; and they help us assess every AI application.&nbsp;

- [00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrBS9rcIcWk&t=190) They prompt questions like, will it be socially&nbsp; beneficial or could it lead to harm in any&nbsp;

- [00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrBS9rcIcWk&t=197) way? One area&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrBS9rcIcWk&t=200) that is top of mind for us is misinformation. Generative AI makes it easier than ever to create&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrBS9rcIcWk&t=208) new content, but it also raises additional questions about its trustworthiness.&nbsp;

- [00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrBS9rcIcWk&t=215) That's why we're developing and providing people&nbsp; with tools to evaluate online information.&nbsp;

- [00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrBS9rcIcWk&t=220) For example, have you come across a photo&nbsp; on a website or one shared by a friend with&nbsp;

- [00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrBS9rcIcWk&t=228) very little context, like this one at the&nbsp; moon landing, and found yourself wondering,&nbsp;

- [00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrBS9rcIcWk&t=233) is this reliable? I have and I'm sure many of you have as well.&nbsp;

- [00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrBS9rcIcWk&t=239) In the coming months, we're adding two&nbsp; new ways for people to evaluate images.&nbsp;

- [00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrBS9rcIcWk&t=245) First, with our About This&nbsp; Image tool in Google Search,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrBS9rcIcWk&t=249) you'll be able to see important information&nbsp;

- [00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrBS9rcIcWk&t=252) such as when and where similar images may&nbsp; have first appeared, where else the image&nbsp;

- [00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrBS9rcIcWk&t=259) has been seen online, including news, fact&nbsp; checking, and social sites, all this providing&nbsp;

- [00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrBS9rcIcWk&t=265) you with helpful context to&nbsp; determine if it's reliable.&nbsp;

- [00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrBS9rcIcWk&t=270) Later this year, you'll also be able to use&nbsp; it if you search for an image or screenshot&nbsp;

- [00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrBS9rcIcWk&t=274) using Google Lens, or when&nbsp; you're on websites in Chrome.&nbsp;

- [00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrBS9rcIcWk&t=281) As we begin to roll out the generative image&nbsp; capabilities, like Sundar mentioned, we will&nbsp;

- [00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrBS9rcIcWk&t=287) ensure that every one of our AI generated&nbsp; images has metadata and markup in the original&nbsp;

- [00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrBS9rcIcWk&t=294) file to give you context if you come&nbsp; across it outside of our platforms.&nbsp;

- [00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrBS9rcIcWk&t=300) Not only that, creators and publishers will&nbsp; be able to add similar metadata, so you'll&nbsp;

- [00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrBS9rcIcWk&t=306) be able to see a label in images in Google&nbsp; Search marking them as AI generated.&nbsp;

- [00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrBS9rcIcWk&t=321) As we apply our AI principles, we also start&nbsp; to see potential tensions when it comes to&nbsp;

- [00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrBS9rcIcWk&t=328) being bold and responsible. Here's an example.&nbsp;

- [00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrBS9rcIcWk&t=332) Universal Translate is an experimental AI video&nbsp; dubbing service that helps experts translate&nbsp;

- [00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrBS9rcIcWk&t=339) a speaker's voice while also&nbsp; matching their lip movements.&nbsp;

- [00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrBS9rcIcWk&t=344) Let me show you how it works with an online&nbsp; college course created in partnership with&nbsp;

- [00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrBS9rcIcWk&t=349) Arizona State University. What many college students don't realize&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrBS9rcIcWk&t=354) is that knowing when to ask for help and then following through on using helpful resources is&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrBS9rcIcWk&t=359) actually a hallmark of becoming a productive adult.&nbsp;

- [00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrBS9rcIcWk&t=379) We use next generation translation models to&nbsp; translate what the speaker is saying, models&nbsp;

- [00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrBS9rcIcWk&t=386) to replicate the style and the tone, and&nbsp; then match the speaker's lip movements.&nbsp;

- [00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrBS9rcIcWk&t=391) Then we bring it all together.&nbsp;

- [00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrBS9rcIcWk&t=394) This is an enormous step forward for learning&nbsp; comprehension, and we're seeing promising&nbsp;

- [00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrBS9rcIcWk&t=399) results with course completion rates. But there's an inherent tension here.&nbsp;

- [00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrBS9rcIcWk&t=405) You can see how this can be incredibly beneficial,&nbsp; but some of the same underlying technology&nbsp;

- [00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrBS9rcIcWk&t=412) could be misused by bad&nbsp; actors to create deep fakes.&nbsp;

- [00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrBS9rcIcWk&t=417) So we've built this service with&nbsp; guardrails to help prevent misuse,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrBS9rcIcWk&t=421) and we make it accessible only to authorized partners.&nbsp;

- [00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrBS9rcIcWk&t=432) And as Sundar mentioned, soon we'll be integrating&nbsp; new innovations in watermarking into our latest&nbsp;

- [00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrBS9rcIcWk&t=439) generative models to also help with&nbsp; the challenge of misinformation.&nbsp;

- [00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrBS9rcIcWk&t=445) Our AI principles also help&nbsp; guide us on what not to do.&nbsp;

- [00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrBS9rcIcWk&t=451) For instance, years ago, we were the first&nbsp; major company to decide not to make a general&nbsp;

- [00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrBS9rcIcWk&t=457) purpose facial recognition&nbsp; API commercially available.&nbsp;

- [00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrBS9rcIcWk&t=462) We felt there weren't&nbsp; adequate safeguards in place.&nbsp;

- [00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrBS9rcIcWk&t=466) Another way we live up to our AI principles&nbsp; is with innovations to tackle challenges as&nbsp;

- [00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrBS9rcIcWk&t=472) they emerge, like reducing the risk of problematic&nbsp; outputs that may be generated by our models.&nbsp;

- [00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrBS9rcIcWk&t=479) We are one of the first in the industry to&nbsp; develop and launch automated adversarial testing&nbsp;

- [00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrBS9rcIcWk&t=486) using large language model technology. We do this for queries like this&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrBS9rcIcWk&t=492) to help uncover and reduce&nbsp; inaccurate outputs, like the one&nbsp;

- [00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrBS9rcIcWk&t=496) on the left, and make them&nbsp; better, like the one on the right.&nbsp;

- [00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrBS9rcIcWk&t=501) We're doing this at a scale that's never been&nbsp; done before at Google, significantly improving&nbsp;

- [00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrBS9rcIcWk&t=506) the speed, quality, and coverage of&nbsp; testing, allowing safety experts to&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrBS9rcIcWk&t=512) focus on the most difficult cases.&nbsp;

- [00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrBS9rcIcWk&t=516) And we're sharing these innovations with others. For example, our Perspective API, originally&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrBS9rcIcWk&t=522) created to help publishers mitigate toxicity, is now being used in large language models.&nbsp;

- [00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrBS9rcIcWk&t=529) Scientific researchers have used our Perspective&nbsp; API to create an industry evaluation standard.&nbsp;

- [00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrBS9rcIcWk&t=536) And today, all significant large language models,&nbsp; including those from OpenAI and Anthropic,&nbsp;

- [00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrBS9rcIcWk&t=542) incorporate this standard to evaluate&nbsp; toxicity generated by their own models.&nbsp;

- [00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrBS9rcIcWk&t=558) Building AI responsibly must be a collective&nbsp; effort involving researchers, social scientists,&nbsp;

- [00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrBS9rcIcWk&t=566) industry experts, governments,&nbsp; and everyday people.&nbsp;

- [00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrBS9rcIcWk&t=571) As well as creators and publishers, everyone&nbsp; benefits from a vibrant content ecosystem&nbsp;

- [00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrBS9rcIcWk&t=578) today and in the future.&nbsp;

- [00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrBS9rcIcWk&t=581) That's why we're getting feedback and we'll&nbsp; be working with the web community on ways&nbsp;

- [00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrBS9rcIcWk&t=586) to give publishers choice and&nbsp; control over their web content.&nbsp;

- [00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrBS9rcIcWk&t=592) It's such an exciting time. There's so much we can accomplish&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrBS9rcIcWk&t=597) and so much we must get right together. We look forward to working with all of you.&nbsp;

- [00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrBS9rcIcWk&t=604) And now I'll hand it off to Samir, who will&nbsp; speak to you about all the exciting developments&nbsp;

- [00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrBS9rcIcWk&t=609) we're bringing to Android. Thank you.
