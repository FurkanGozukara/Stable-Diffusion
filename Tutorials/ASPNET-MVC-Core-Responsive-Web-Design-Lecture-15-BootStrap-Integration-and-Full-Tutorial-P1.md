- [00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=111) use jsdeliver a free open source cdn using a package manager or need to

- [00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=113) using a package manager or need to download the source files

- [00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=115) download the source files okay uh we have seen how to use

- [00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=118) okay uh we have seen how to use bootstrap in our application with

- [00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=122) bootstrap in our application with using cdn and if cdn fails then we can

- [00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=126) using cdn and if cdn fails then we can use our localhost i will quickly

- [00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=130) use our localhost i will quickly show that again

- [00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=132) show that again so let me close all

- [00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=136) so let me close all controllers and files

- [00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=138) controllers and files okay it is still loading

- [00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=142) okay it is still loading okay let's give it some time

- [00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=145) okay let's give it some time so there is a css copy paste the style

- [00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=148) so there is a css copy paste the style sheet link into your head

- [00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=150) sheet link into your head by the way i am assuming that you have

- [00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=152) by the way i am assuming that you have some knowledge of html css and such

- [00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=157) some knowledge of html css and such previously

- [00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=158) previously just basic knowledge

- [00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=165) also you already seen what is html css and other things in our

- [00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=169) what is html css and other things in our previous lectures

- [00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=171) previous lectures and

- [00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=172) and so there is also

- [00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=175) so there is also uh

- [00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=177) uh jquery

- [00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=178) jquery i think or bootstrap javascript let's

- [00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=181) i think or bootstrap javascript let's see that

- [00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=184) see that so this is the javascript plugin

- [00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=192) that is necessary for bootstrap i believe let's see that

- [00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=198) yeah and

- [00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=199) and [Music]

- [00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=207) okay there are some two separate

- [00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=209) two separate obsidians and there is the

- [00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=212) obsidians and there is the css file

- [00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=215) css file okay our project is still okay it is

- [00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=218) okay our project is still okay it is loaded let's rename our project and

- [00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=220) loaded let's rename our project and start working

- [00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=226) lecture 15 and

- [00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=233) let's also rename our solution as lecture 15.

- [00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=237) solution as lecture 15. okay so where do we load javascript and

- [00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=240) okay so where do we load javascript and css files globally we load them in our

- [00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=244) css files globally we load them in our vivstars file so our vivstart file will

- [00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=247) vivstars file so our vivstart file will be

- [00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=254) loaded before every page is getting loaded

- [00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=255) getting loaded and you see we had already added some

- [00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=258) and you see we had already added some bootstrap and some

- [00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=261) bootstrap and some javascript files

- [00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=264) javascript files so we will change it with the latest

- [00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=266) so we will change it with the latest version here

- [00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=267) version here let's see we have jquery we have ajax on

- [00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=271) let's see we have jquery we have ajax on obtrusive we have used this to convert

- [00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=273) obtrusive we have used this to convert everything into

- [00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=282) ajax supporting html we have jquery validate

- [00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=283) validate these are all

- [00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=284) these are all cdn links and we have boots up here

- [00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=287) cdn links and we have boots up here which has a cdn link and if it fails we

- [00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=290) which has a cdn link and if it fails we have our

- [00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=292) have our bootstrap

- [00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=293) bootstrap so let's uh replace this with the latest

- [00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=345) know if that does matter

- [00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=347) does matter and then there's cross

- [00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=348) and then there's cross origin enemies

- [00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=351) origin enemies okay now we have bootstrap five

- [00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=359) we have this is the beginning part of beef start

- [00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=361) beef start this is a message that we keep then we

- [00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=363) this is a message that we keep then we also need to

- [00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=366) also need to put our

- [00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=367) put our javascript

- [00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=369) javascript you see many of our components require

- [00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=371) you see many of our components require the use of javascript functions specif

- [00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=373) the use of javascript functions specif specifically they require our own

- [00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=375) specifically they require our own javascript plugins and popper

- [00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=378) javascript plugins and popper so what is proper if you wonder

- [00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=381) so what is proper if you wonder popper is a tool to bump up over

- [00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=383) popper is a tool to bump up over positioning engine

- [00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=389) okay we can check it out on

- [00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=392) check it out on uh

- [00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=392) uh called sampox sandbox io

- [00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=396) called sampox sandbox io overflow prevention you see

- [00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=400) overflow prevention you see it's pretty cool

- [00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=402) it's pretty cool flipping you see it is flipping

- [00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=406) flipping you see it is flipping ah it is very cool

- [00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=409) ah it is very cool okay it is not necessary to check so

- [00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=412) okay it is not necessary to check so there are two separate uh codes let's

- [00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=415) there are two separate uh codes let's also add them to our

- [00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=417) also add them to our uh

- [00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=419) uh project

- [00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=420) project like this

- [00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=421) like this i think i will add them above the

- [00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=424) i think i will add them above the css but let's see the orders

- [00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=442) okay says that before all other style shits and

- [00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=447) so this should be added to the end of your pages right before closing body tag

- [00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=451) your pages right before closing body tag um

- [00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=452) um if you want to add them

- [00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=454) if you want to add them to the end

- [00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=457) to the end by the way since this is special

- [00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=458) by the way since this is special character you see it is getting

- [00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=461) character you see it is getting like that and i have to change it like

- [00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=463) like that and i have to change it like this

- [00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=464) this so it will load us properly

- [00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=470) okay actually i don't know if we need this

- [00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=472) actually i don't know if we need this add character here

- [00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=483) so when we remove adds what happens yeah it is not working

- [00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=486) yeah it is not working okay so we need double add

- [00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=489) okay so we need double add our single heads will work

- [00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=493) our single heads will work this is there okay so this is the laser

- [00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=495) this is there okay so this is the laser page therefore i have to add double

- [00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=499) page therefore i have to add double that's like this

- [00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=519) we have our other scripts jquery mean okay

- [00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=521) okay so we have added our

- [00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=523) so we have added our secret by the way this secret should be

- [00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=532) called right before the body attack but

- [00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=536) um if we call them here i don't think so it

- [00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=538) if we call them here i don't think so it could make a lot of difference

- [00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=542) could make a lot of difference although

- [00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=548) let's see we can have a custom section

- [00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=550) section uh to load this inside

- [00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=553) uh to load this inside body but end of the body attack how can

- [00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=556) body but end of the body attack how can we do that let's add a lecture 15 to see

- [00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=567) and let's see

- [00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=572) okay uh inject

- [00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=573) inject js file and of

- [00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=577) js file and of body tag every page

- [00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=580) body tag every page there is weak star body or are there any

- [00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=583) there is weak star body or are there any weave and or something like that

- [00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=606) i think we can work i think this would work

- [00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=608) work so let's

- [00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=610) so let's test it

- [00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=612) test it let's continue with our

- [00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=614) let's continue with our thing so there is also bundle every

- [00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=617) thing so there is also bundle every boots are just to be playing

- [00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=618) boots are just to be playing independence without two bundles both

- [00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=620) independence without two bundles both ones okay

- [00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=623) ones okay you can also use bundle if you want to

- [00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=626) you can also use bundle if you want to do only single request but

- [00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=628) do only single request but either way it would work

- [00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=632) either way it would work and there are also some

- [00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=634) and there are also some components

- [00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=636) components so you see these components are

- [00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=638) so you see these components are requiring javascript work

- [00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=640) requiring javascript work dropdowns models number and such and

- [00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=643) dropdowns models number and such and there is a starter template okay

- [00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=646) there is a starter template okay so we were going to quote our lecture 15

- [00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=650) so we were going to quote our lecture 15 let's add lecture 15 leave

- [00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=659) okay let's name it as

- [00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=662) let's name it as lecture 15

- [00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=665) lecture 15 index yeah

- [00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=667) index yeah something like this

- [00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=669) something like this and let's add our controller as lecture

- [00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=672) and let's add our controller as lecture 15.

- [00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=683) picture 15 controller

- [00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=689) and let's change our route to lecture 15

- [00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=694) let's change our route to lecture 15 like this and it will return

- [00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=697) like this and it will return the custom name which is lecture 15

- [00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=700) the custom name which is lecture 15 index

- [00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=702) index wave

- [00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=707) okay this should work so

- [00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=713) okay and so what is the

- [00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=714) so what is the starter template

- [00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=716) starter template be sure to have your pages set up with

- [00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=718) be sure to have your pages set up with latest design and development standards

- [00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=721) latest design and development standards that means using html5 doctype including

- [00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=724) that means using html5 doctype including viewport meta tag for proper responsive

- [00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=727) viewport meta tag for proper responsive behaviors

- [00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=728) behaviors so

- [00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=729) so let's start with uh copy and pasting

- [00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=732) let's start with uh copy and pasting this uh simply

- [00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=739) like this we have doctype html and we have html language these are the

- [00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=794) oh we need to use a

- [00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=799) template uh to have our

- [00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=801) to have our master page if you remember that so

- [00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=806) master page if you remember that so how we were doing our templates

- [00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=809) how we were doing our templates uh it was in previous lecture so let's

- [00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=812) uh it was in previous lecture so let's remember it

- [00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=831) okay [Music]

- [00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=839) actually let's call it a layout another template and we see core layout yeah

- [00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=848) so what we need is we need to have a layout to properly load

- [00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=851) layout to properly load our

- [00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=852) our responsive design in every page

- [00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=857) responsive design in every page okay so it is net layout

- [00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=861) okay so it is net layout there are common layout share directives

- [00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=863) there are common layout share directives and everything so okay so our layout

- [00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=866) and everything so okay so our layout will be like this

- [00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=867) will be like this it will be

- [00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=868) it will be valid in every page header left

- [00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=870) valid in every page header left navigation content footer

- [00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=873) navigation content footer the layout

- [00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=874) the layout is totally up to you

- [00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=878) is totally up to you and we put layout inside shared with

- [00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=881) and we put layout inside shared with layout cshtml

- [00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=884) layout cshtml let's go to our shaders folder and let's

- [00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=886) let's go to our shaders folder and let's add our

- [00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=889) add our layout view by the way you need to you

- [00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=891) layout view by the way you need to you should follow the naming convention

- [00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=895) should follow the naming convention okay i will name it as layout cs html

- [00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=906) this will be by default looked for okay let's read it

- [00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=912) the layout defines a top level template for views in the app apps don't require

- [00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=914) for views in the app apps don't require a layout

- [00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=915) a layout apps can define more than one layout

- [00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=918) apps can define more than one layout with different views specifying

- [00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=919) with different views specifying different layouts

- [00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=921) different layouts the following code shows the layout file

- [00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=923) the following code shows the layout file for a template created project with a

- [00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=925) for a template created project with a controller and views

- [00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=928) controller and views okay so there is a

- [00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=930) okay so there is a layout like this

- [00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=938) okay so in this layout you see it is

- [00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=940) so in this layout you see it is following

- [00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=941) following the conversion of

- [00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=946) [Music] the

- [00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=951) bootstrap like here so we will change this into

- [00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=955) like here so we will change this into our

- [00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=956) our bootstrap

- [00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=957) bootstrap layout let's copy and paste it

- [00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=961) layout let's copy and paste it like this

- [00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=969) okay and you see in the bootstrap it is already

- [00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=972) you see in the bootstrap it is already included like this so i will remove it

- [00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=975) included like this so i will remove it from our wave start

- [00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=983) okay let's remove it since it we will be using our layout

- [00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=985) using our layout okay i have removed it

- [00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=988) okay i have removed it and then there is title so for the title

- [00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=992) and then there is title so for the title we can use view data title

- [00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=995) we can use view data title like here this is a more proper

- [00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=997) like here this is a more proper way

- [00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=998) way if title does not exist i think it won't

- [00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=1002) if title does not exist i think it won't uh show anything

- [00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=1004) uh show anything so this is the application name

- [00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=1007) so this is the application name we add to the the append to the end of

- [00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=1009) we add to the the append to the end of the page title

- [00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=1011) the page title so these will come from our view data

- [00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=1015) so these will come from our view data and with this way we can load any title

- [00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=1018) and with this way we can load any title to our page

- [00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=1020) to our page and then there is h1 and let's see

- [00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=1024) and then there is h1 and let's see you see there is environment include

- [00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=1026) you see there is environment include development

- [00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=1027) development so this is the development links and

- [00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=1030) so this is the development links and this is the non-development links

- [00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=1034) this is the non-development links okay css is

- [00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=1036) okay css is included here and then there is the

- [00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=1039) included here and then there is the bundle of

- [00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=1040) bundle of cdn is included here

- [00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=1047) and if you want we can separate it like this but i think i won't separate

- [00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=1051) this but i think i won't separate so

- [00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=1052) so let's remove it i will use bundle if you

- [00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=1055) let's remove it i will use bundle if you see this will come before the bodytalk

- [00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=1059) but to be able to have that

- [00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=1067) i need to add this render body just before this

- [00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=1070) just before this script like here

- [00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=1086) render section scripts if you want to include some

- [00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=1088) include some secrets

- [00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=1093) section we can edit here and it is required for as you can see

- [00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=1097) required for as you can see uh so i will append the scripts

- [00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=1589) examples we will see them let's continue box sizing

- [00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=1591) box sizing for more straightforward sizing in css

- [00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=1594) for more straightforward sizing in css we switch the global box sizing value

- [00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=1596) we switch the global box sizing value from content box to border box

- [00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=1599) from content box to border box this ensures padding does not affect the

- [00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=1603) final computed width of an element but it can cause problems with some

- [00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=1604) it can cause problems with some third-party software like google maps

- [00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=1649) resets to common html element okay for reboot we need to include

- [00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=1651) okay for reboot we need to include anything this is important

- [00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=1658) okay i think we don't need to include it is included in the css file

- [00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=1679) yeah it's already included in the css file so let's continue with get

- [00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=1710) okay let's read this as well browsers and devices

- [00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=1713) browsers and devices learn about the browsers and devices

- [00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=1715) learn about the browsers and devices from modern to old that are supported by

- [00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=1719) bootstrap including known quarks and bugs for each okay so you see

- [00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=1722) bugs for each okay so you see not all browsers are supported it's also

- [00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=1726) not all browsers are supported it's also impossible to support all of the

- [00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=1728) impossible to support all of the existing browsers but

- [00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=1730) existing browsers but main ones are supported supported

- [00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=1732) main ones are supported supported browsers

- [00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=1734) browsers bootstrap supports the latest stable

- [00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=1751) supported however bootstrap should in most cases

- [00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=1753) however bootstrap should in most cases display and function correctly in these

- [00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=1755) display and function correctly in these browsers as well

- [00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=1757) browsers as well more specific support information is

- [00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=1759) more specific support information is provided below

- [00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=1761) provided below you can find our supported range of

- [00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=1763) you can find our supported range of browsers and their versions in our dot

- [00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=1765) browsers and their versions in our dot browsers list trick file

- [00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=1767) browsers list trick file okay let's open their file and yeah same

- [00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=1771) okay let's open their file and yeah same as here so it supports

- [00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=1774) as here so it supports chrome

- [00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=1775) chrome overversion 60

- [00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=1777) overversion 60 what is our chrome

- [00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=1784) version right now okay this is h actually

- [00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=1787) okay this is h actually so you see r8 is version 91

- [00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=1790) so you see r8 is version 91 and

- [00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=1799) but it supports all edge probably because it

- [00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=1802) it supports all edge probably because it is a

- [00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=1806) new browser and let's check our chrome

- [00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=1809) browser and let's check our chrome version

- [00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=1812) version so here settings

- [00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=1823) here so it is 91 you see it is starting

- [00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=1826) so it is 91 you see it is starting support from version 60.

- [00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=1829) support from version 60. and

- [00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=1831) and they also use autoprefixer to handle

- [00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=1833) they also use autoprefixer to handle intended browser support and such

- [00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=1837) intended browser support and such mobile devices this is the what is most

- [00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=1839) mobile devices this is the what is most meta for us

- [00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=1842) meta for us okay

- [00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=1848) mobile devices generally speaking bootstrap supports

- [00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=1850) generally speaking bootstrap supports the latest versions of each major

- [00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=1852) the latest versions of each major platform's default browsers

- [00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=1854) platform's default browsers note that proxy browsers such as opera

- [00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=1857) note that proxy browsers such as opera mini opera mobile's turbo mode uc

- [00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=1859) mini opera mobile's turbo mode uc browser mini amazon silk are not

- [00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=1862) browser mini amazon silk are not supported they are not supported but i

- [00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=1864) supported they are not supported but i think they would work pretty well

- [00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=1866) think they would work pretty well and desktop brothers all is supported

- [00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=1871) and desktop brothers all is supported okay this is not very important

- [00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=1874) okay this is not very important um

- [00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=1876) um okay and then there's javascript

- [00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=1882) okay [Music]

- [00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=1891) there are some dependencies okay still want to use gquery it is possible

- [00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=1897) let's read this because gquery is very important for us

- [00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=1900) important for us still want to use jquery

- [00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=1902) still want to use jquery it's possible

- [00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=1904) it's possible bootstrap 5 is designed to be used

- [00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=1906) bootstrap 5 is designed to be used without jquery but it's still possible

- [00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=1909) without jquery but it's still possible to use our components with jquery

- [00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=1912) to use our components with jquery if bootstrap detects jquery in the

- [00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=1914) if bootstrap detects jquery in the window object it'll add all of our

- [00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=1915) window object it'll add all of our components in jquery's plugin system

- [00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=1918) components in jquery's plugin system this means you'll be able to do dollar

- [00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=1920) this means you'll be able to do dollar data bs toggle equals tooltip dot

- [00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=1922) data bs toggle equals tooltip dot tooltip to enable tool tips

- [00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=1925) tooltip to enable tool tips the same goes for our other components

- [00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=1927) the same goes for our other components okay and there is data attributes data

- [00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=1930) okay and there is data attributes data attributes

- [00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=1932) attributes nearly all bootstrap plugins can be

- [00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=1934) nearly all bootstrap plugins can be enabled and configured through html

- [00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=1937) enabled and configured through html alone with data attributes our preferred

- [00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=1939) alone with data attributes our preferred way of using javascript functionality

- [00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=1942) way of using javascript functionality be sure to only use one set of data

- [00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=1944) be sure to only use one set of data attributes on a single element example

- [00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=1947) attributes on a single element example you cannot trigger a tooltip and modal

- [00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=1949) you cannot trigger a tooltip and modal from the same button

- [00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=1951) from the same button okay

- [00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=1952) okay selectors

- [00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=1954) selectors selectors

- [00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=1956) selectors currently to query dom elements we use

- [00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=1958) currently to query dom elements we use the native methods query selector in

- [00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=1960) the native methods query selector in query selector all for performance

- [00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=1961) query selector all for performance reasons so you have to use valid

- [00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=1963) reasons so you have to use valid selectors

- [00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=1965) selectors if you use special selectors for example

- [00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=1967) if you use special selectors for example collapse example be sure to escape them

- [00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=1971) collapse example be sure to escape them okay then there's events

- [00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=1974) okay then there's events events

- [00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=1976) events bootstrap provides custom events for

- [00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=1978) bootstrap provides custom events for most plugins unique actions

- [00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=1981) most plugins unique actions generally these come in an infinitive

- [00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=1983) generally these come in an infinitive and past participle form where the

- [00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=1985) and past participle form where the infinitive ex show is triggered at the

- [00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=1987) infinitive ex show is triggered at the start of an event and its past

- [00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=1989) start of an event and its past participle form ex shown is triggered on

- [00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=1991) participle form ex shown is triggered on the completion of an action

- [00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=1994) the completion of an action all infinitive events provide prevent

- [00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=1996) all infinitive events provide prevent default functionality

- [00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=1998) default functionality this provides the ability to stop the

- [00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=2000) this provides the ability to stop the execution of an action before it starts

- [00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=2003) execution of an action before it starts returning false from an event handler

- [00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=2005) returning false from an event handler will also automatically call prevent

- [00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=2007) will also automatically call prevent default

- [00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=2014) okay anyway let's

- [00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=2016) let's continue

- [00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=2017) continue because usually we don't have a lot of

- [00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=2020) because usually we don't have a lot of time to see everything

- [00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=2023) time to see everything okay i will just see

- [00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=2025) okay i will just see customize overview let's see this

- [00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=2029) customize overview let's see this okay this is related customization this

- [00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=2032) okay this is related customization this is options

- [00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=2045) okay there's colors

- [00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=2052) the same colors yeah all colors

- [00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=2059) okay components

- [00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=2061) components let's close this response here

- [00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=2069) yeah let's start with layouts breakpoints call concepts

- [00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=2099) okay i think i will come start continuing with examples

- [00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=2101) start continuing with examples of let's see

- [00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=2114) headers yeah let's start with headers if there is a nice oh there is no

- [00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=2116) if there is a nice oh there is no example

- [00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=2126) you see you can look everything you need from here but

- [00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=2128) from here but i think we can follow

- [00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=2152) okay is the video series no

- [00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=2194) i don't see include tutorials so far so i think let's continue with the

- [00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=2197) so i think let's continue with the examples on

- [00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=2200) examples on our

- [00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=2201) our on the bootstrap official

- [00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=2203) on the bootstrap official so let's download them and implement

- [00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=2206) so let's download them and implement them by one by one

- [00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=2214) okay there are a lot of examples so

- [00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=2215) so let's

- [00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=2244) uh headers i mean the yeah header template or not no no bar template

- [00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=2251) actually perhaps we should start with grids

- [00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=2267) yeah let's start with layout first

- [00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=2269) layout first with breakpoints okay

- [00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=2275) breakpoints breakpoints are customizable widths that

- [00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=2277) breakpoints are customizable widths that determine how your responsive layout

- [00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=2279) determine how your responsive layout behaves across device or viewport sizes

- [00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=2281) behaves across device or viewport sizes in

- [00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=2282) in bootstrap on this page

- [00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=2304) okay nothing quote here

- [00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=2332) okay these are related to satisfies not our topic right now

- [00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=2335) our topic right now okay i think break what we know what we

- [00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=2338) okay i think break what we know what we need to know about breakpoints is that

- [00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=2341) need to know about breakpoints is that x small means

- [00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=2343) x small means dimensions lower than

- [00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=2346) dimensions lower than 576 pixel you may wonder how much pixel

- [00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=2350) 576 pixel you may wonder how much pixel is that i will show you that with

- [00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=2352) is that i will show you that with paint.net

- [00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=2354) paint.net which is my favorite

- [00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=2359) image editing

- [00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=2360) editing program it is free

- [00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=2362) program it is free so this is my screenshot when i

- [00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=2365) so this is my screenshot when i click this rectangle select you see at

- [00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=2369) click this rectangle select you see at the bottom here it is selecting uh

- [00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=2373) the bottom here it is selecting uh it is showing the size

- [00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=2376) it is showing the size so

- [00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=2377) so from here i can use a fixed size and it

- [00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=2380) from here i can use a fixed size and it will be i can make it like

- [00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=2382) will be i can make it like 576

- [00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=2384) 576 so you see this is the 576 is if the

- [00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=2387) so you see this is the 576 is if the screen size is smaller than

- [00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=2390) screen size is smaller than that is the breakpoint of x small

- [00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=2393) that is the breakpoint of x small so

- [00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=2394) so for small you see it is bigger or equal

- [00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=2396) for small you see it is bigger or equal to 576

- [00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=2398) to 576 and

- [00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=2399) and uh obviously it is smaller than uh 708

- [00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=2409) 706 uh 668 you can see it's like this

- [00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=2416) okay and for large like this

- [00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=2419) for large like this okay so this is what it means and these

- [00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=2421) okay so this is what it means and these are the breakpoint namings and you will

- [00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=2423) are the breakpoint namings and you will see now where we use them

- [00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=2427) see now where we use them it is starting with containers

- [00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=2430) it is starting with containers containers

- [00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=2432) containers containers are a fundamental building

- [00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=2434) containers are a fundamental building block of bootstrap that contain pad and

- [00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=2436) block of bootstrap that contain pad and align your content within a given device

- [00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=2438) align your content within a given device or viewport

- [00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=2441) or viewport okay how they work

- [00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=2443) okay how they work how they work

- [00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=2445) how they work containers are the most basic layout

- [00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=2447) containers are the most basic layout element in bootstrap and are required

- [00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=2449) element in bootstrap and are required when using our default grid system we

- [00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=2452) when using our default grid system we are going to use default grid system to

- [00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=2454) are going to use default grid system to have mobile

- [00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=2457) have mobile friendly and responsive web design

- [00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=2460) friendly and responsive web design system

- [00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=2461) system containers are used to contain pad and

- [00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=2463) containers are used to contain pad and sometimes center the content within them

- [00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=2467) sometimes center the content within them while containers can be nested most

- [00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=2468) while containers can be nested most layouts do not require a nested

- [00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=2470) layouts do not require a nested container

- [00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=2472) container bootstrap comes with three different

- [00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=2474) bootstrap comes with three different containers

- [00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=2476) containers dot container which sets a max width at

- [00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=2478) dot container which sets a max width at each responsive breakpoint

- [00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=2480) each responsive breakpoint dot container fluid which is width 100

- [00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=2484) dot container fluid which is width 100 at all break points

- [00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=2486) at all break points dot container dash break point which is

- [00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=2488) dot container dash break point which is width 100 until the specified break

- [00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=2491) width 100 until the specified break point

- [00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=2493) point the table below illustrates how each

- [00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=2495) the table below illustrates how each container's max width compares to the

- [00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=2497) container's max width compares to the original dot container and dot container

- [00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=2499) original dot container and dot container fluid across each breakpoint

- [00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=2501) fluid across each breakpoint okay let's see the great example uh to

- [00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=2504) okay let's see the great example uh to understand them better

- [00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=2511) can we see the source code here

- [00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=2514) source code here i think we can see it from here so i'm

- [00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=2516) i think we can see it from here so i'm going to copy it here

- [00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=2522) so where we are going to use it we are going to use inside our index html you

- [00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=2526) going to use inside our index html you see a container as i'm a 100 persons

- [00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=2529) see a container as i'm a 100 persons right until small break point

- [00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=2532) right until small break point and

- [00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=2533) and here this is medium large

- [00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=2536) here this is medium large extra large

- [00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=2539) extra large and there is also

- [00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=2541) and there is also container fluids

- [00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=2543) container fluids let's also try that

- [00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=2552) okay you see they are named with class and

- [00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=2553) and container field is

- [00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=2559) like this okay let's run the application to see

- [00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=2561) okay let's run the application to see how they behave

- [00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=2568) and you can see their behavior here uh 100 percent until extra small

- [00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=2572) uh 100 percent until extra small then these are the sizes that it will

- [00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=2575) then these are the sizes that it will take

- [00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=2580) okay let me include everything small medium

- [00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=2583) let me include everything small medium large

- [00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=2585) large xlr xx large fluid

- [00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=2589) xlr xx large fluid and we also need to have a default

- [00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=2590) and we also need to have a default container example

- [00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=2592) container example yeah default container and small are

- [00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=2594) yeah default container and small are behaving exactly the same yeah

- [00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=2598) behaving exactly the same yeah okay so let's make it full screen and

- [00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=2601) okay so let's make it full screen and let's also add a border to them

- [00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=2603) let's also add a border to them so we can see better

- [00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=2607) so we can see better okay there is border one

- [00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=2609) okay there is border one yeah let's make them border one so these

- [00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=2612) yeah let's make them border one so these are classes of

- [00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=2613) are classes of bootstrap and uc visual studio is

- [00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=2616) bootstrap and uc visual studio is automatically

- [00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=2618) automatically showing

- [00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=2619) showing those as an option

- [00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=2626) the only annoying thing with and we see is that we can't just change

- [00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=2630) and we see is that we can't just change cshtml and refresh actually there's a

- [00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=2632) cshtml and refresh actually there's a way to do that let's implement it

- [00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=2636) way to do that let's implement it again we see course change

- [00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=2639) again we see course change cshtml and refresh

- [00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=2671) so we need to add this to the startup cs let's add it here

- [00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=2673) let's add it here this will allow us to change cshtml and

- [00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=2676) this will allow us to change cshtml and webpage and it will automatically

- [00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=2679) webpage and it will automatically refresh it we are going to add it to

- [00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=2681) refresh it we are going to add it to startup

- [00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=2686) okay it will be services at therefore it

- [00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=2689) it will be services at therefore it should be here

- [00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=2691) should be here like this services at controller with

- [00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=2693) like this services at controller with views

- [00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=2695) views okay for this to work

- [00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=2750) okay it says you need to add this let's edit

- [00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=2776) okay it appears that we need to first install nuget package let's

- [00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=2779) install nuget package let's install it

- [00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=2828) okay it is adding a lot of extra code you see if you want to have runtime

- [00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=2830) you see if you want to have runtime compilation features

- [00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=2833) compilation features you need to add a lot of

- [00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=2845) okay now it works let's make it a single line

- [00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=2848) now it works let's make it a single line like this

- [00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=2850) like this okay let's run the application and test

- [00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=2852) okay let's run the application and test it

- [00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=2870) so what will these allah allow us to refresh page

- [00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=2874) allow us to refresh page and see it is refreshing without press

- [00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=2876) and see it is refreshing without press starting the application

- [00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=2904) let's test it

- [00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=2943) you see border has to be added with borders

- [00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=2944) borders so

- [00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=2946) so there is also borders like this and what

- [00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=2948) there is also borders like this and what about border color

- [00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=2954) okay so it is like this so let's use this

- [00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=2962) now i will just change border one to okay border primary borders to pair

- [00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=2966) okay border primary borders to pair additive

- [00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=2967) additive i am replacing all

- [00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=2970) i am replacing all oh

- [00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=2971) oh it did replace our woodstruck file which

- [00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=2974) it did replace our woodstruck file which is

- [00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=2975) is not what we wanted

- [00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=2977) not what we wanted okay i did the ctrl z there

- [00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=2980) okay i did the ctrl z there okay i just need to change this page not

- [00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=2983) okay i just need to change this page not entire solution you have to be careful

- [00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=2986) entire solution you have to be careful with that

- [00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=2987) with that okay now when i replace the page it

- [00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=2990) okay now when i replace the page it should get refreshed

- [00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=2995) you see that this is taking time because it is recompiling the application on

- [00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=2998) it is recompiling the application on runtime

- [00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=2999) runtime and on a tester computer it would take

- [00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3003) and on a tester computer it would take lesser time okay now we can see borders

- [00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3005) lesser time okay now we can see borders as well

- [00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3006) as well okay now since my screen is full

- [00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3010) okay now since my screen is full size you see they are maximum one

- [00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3014) size you see they are maximum one hundred

- [00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3015) hundred one thousand

- [00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3016) one thousand uh

- [00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3017) uh three hundred twenty pixel we can also

- [00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3020) three hundred twenty pixel we can also verify that

- [00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3028) uh to see computed size okay so the completed size is

- [00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3031) okay so the completed size is let's see

- [00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3033) let's see here

- [00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3034) here um does this show okay so you see max

- [00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3037) um does this show okay so you see max bit is one thousand 1320 pixel because

- [00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3041) bit is one thousand 1320 pixel because this is what it is

- [00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3043) this is what it is it is all maximum up to 1 303 pixels

- [00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3048) it is all maximum up to 1 303 pixels if it is x x large

- [00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3050) if it is x x large or x large or large or it doesn't matter

- [00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3052) or x large or large or it doesn't matter as long as your screen is bigger than

- [00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3058) uh 1400 pixel

- [00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3060) 1400 pixel and currently my screen size is bigger

- [00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3062) and currently my screen size is bigger than 100 100 400 pixels it is 19

- [00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3068) than 100 100 400 pixels it is 19 pixel therefore this is the maximum

- [00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3070) pixel therefore this is the maximum however if you set foot it is taking

- [00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3072) however if you set foot it is taking entire screen and now you will see how

- [00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3075) entire screen and now you will see how it behaves as soon as i change my pixel

- [00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3080) it behaves as soon as i change my pixel uh dimension screen size okay

- [00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3083) uh dimension screen size okay so you see uh

- [00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3085) so you see uh here it is showing my screen size as

- [00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3088) here it is showing my screen size as soon as it gets below 1

- [00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3092) soon as it gets below 1 400 pixel the behavior changes how

- [00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3097) 400 pixel the behavior changes how you see when it is lower than 1

- [00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3100) you see when it is lower than 1 400 pixel they are starting to behave

- [00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3103) 400 pixel they are starting to behave different

- [00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3105) different on x large large medium small extra

- [00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3108) on x large large medium small extra smooth

- [00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3110) smooth so

- [00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3111) so this is how what it is be

- [00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3117) being responsive based on the screen size

- [00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3119) based on the screen size the behavior is

- [00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3122) the behavior is you see 100 percent white until extra

- [00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3125) you see 100 percent white until extra large break point

- [00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3127) large break point uh and these are also 100 percent right

- [00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3130) uh and these are also 100 percent right after extra large point okay

- [00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3133) after extra large point okay you see the value keep changing

- [00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3137) you see the value keep changing until they reach to a point

- [00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3139) until they reach to a point and they will become all 100

- [00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3142) and they will become all 100 after below

- [00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3144) after below 576.

- [00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3145) 576. [Music]

- [00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3150) okay here you see how the behavior changes

- [00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3153) here you see how the behavior changes and fleet is

- [00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3155) and fleet is uh spawning into the

- [00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3158) uh spawning into the next line i think others will also spawn

- [00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3162) next line i think others will also spawn because i live

- [00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3164) because i live so this what this is about

- [00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3166) so this what this is about containers and the breakpoints

- [00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3170) containers and the breakpoints breakpoints defines

- [00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3173) breakpoints defines the dimensions of the screen and how

- [00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3175) the dimensions of the screen and how they will behave okay

- [00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3177) they will behave okay and this is the

- [00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3178) and this is the containers and this is a fleet container

- [00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3182) containers and this is a fleet container okay

- [00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3184) okay so

- [00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3192) in bootstrap and

- [00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3195) bootstrap and all the

- [00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3215) okay let's move to the next then we will see grid

- [00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3220) grid is really important and this is the core of the

- [00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3224) and this is the core of the responsive web design

- [00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3234) grid system use our powerful mobile first

- [00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3237) system use our powerful mobile first flexbox grid to build layouts of all

- [00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3239) flexbox grid to build layouts of all shapes and sizes thanks to a twelve

- [00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3241) shapes and sizes thanks to a twelve column system six default responsive

- [00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3244) column system six default responsive tiers sas variables and mix ins and

- [00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3246) tiers sas variables and mix ins and dozens of predefined classes

- [00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3249) dozens of predefined classes on this page okay let's start with the

- [00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3251) on this page okay let's start with the example example

- [00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3254) example example bootstrap's grid system uses a series of

- [00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3257) bootstrap's grid system uses a series of containers rows and columns to layout

- [00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3259) containers rows and columns to layout and align content

- [00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3261) and align content it's built with flexbox and is fully

- [00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3263) it's built with flexbox and is fully responsive

- [00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3265) responsive below is an example and an in-depth

- [00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3267) below is an example and an in-depth explanation for how the grid system

- [00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3269) explanation for how the grid system comes together

- [00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3270) comes together so what is flexbox let's start with that

- [00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3273) so what is flexbox let's start with that first

- [00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3282) basic concepts of flexbox the flexible box module usually referred

- [00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3284) the flexible box module usually referred to as flexbox was designed as a

- [00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3287) to as flexbox was designed as a one-dimensional layout model and is a

- [00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3289) one-dimensional layout model and is a method that could offer space

- [00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3290) method that could offer space distribution between items in an

- [00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3292) distribution between items in an interface and powerful alignment

- [00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3293) interface and powerful alignment capabilities

- [00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3295) capabilities this article gives an outline of the

- [00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3297) this article gives an outline of the main features of flexbox which we will

- [00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3299) main features of flexbox which we will be exploring in more detail in the rest

- [00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3301) be exploring in more detail in the rest of these guides

- [00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3303) of these guides when we describe flexbox as being

- [00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3305) when we describe flexbox as being one-dimensional we are describing the

- [00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3307) one-dimensional we are describing the fact that flexbox deals with layout in

- [00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3309) fact that flexbox deals with layout in one dimension at a time either as a row

- [00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3311) one dimension at a time either as a row or as a column

- [00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3313) or as a column this can be contrasted with the

- [00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3315) this can be contrasted with the two-dimensional model of css grid layout

- [00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3317) two-dimensional model of css grid layout which controls columns and rows together

- [00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3321) which controls columns and rows together okay so this is about

- [00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3323) okay so this is about flexbox we don't need to

- [00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3326) flexbox we don't need to get more details right now

- [00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3328) get more details right now let's continue with bootstrap

- [00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3331) let's continue with bootstrap okay

- [00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3332) okay so there are three columns here and it

- [00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3335) so there are three columns here and it is printed with this

- [00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3341) let's add this to our page um

- [00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3342) um i will add all the newest examples to

- [00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3345) i will add all the newest examples to the top when doing

- [00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3349) the top when doing working

- [00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3355) so let's add some breakpoints like this

- [00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3357) let's add some breakpoints like this okay

- [00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3358) okay so there is a div class container

- [00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3360) so there is a div class container that means that it is container type

- [00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3363) that means that it is container type and since no breakpoint is defined it

- [00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3367) and since no breakpoint is defined it will behave as small container

- [00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3370) will behave as small container because it is equal to small as you

- [00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3372) because it is equal to small as you remember

- [00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3373) remember then it has a class row so this is what

- [00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3377) then it has a class row so this is what it is being um

- [00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3380) it is being um flexbox handling uh

- [00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3384) flexbox handling uh one dimension at a time

- [00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3386) one dimension at a time and then

- [00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3388) and then there is columns so it will have single

- [00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3391) there is columns so it will have single row and three columns like this it is

- [00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3394) row and three columns like this it is like table

- [00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3396) like table uh this is actually pretty much much

- [00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3398) uh this is actually pretty much much like the older uh

- [00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3400) like the older uh technology we can call now table

- [00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3403) technology we can call now table so it has

- [00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3404) so it has three columns and single row therefore

- [00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3407) three columns and single row therefore we have one table row and we have

- [00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3410) we have one table row and we have three

- [00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3411) three okay table

- [00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3414) okay table columns like this

- [00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3419) and this

- [00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3421) this okay however

- [00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3423) okay however now you should work with

- [00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3426) now you should work with [Music]

- [00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3429) [Music] bootstrap instead of tables because

- [00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3432) bootstrap instead of tables because bootstrap is better more responsive

- [00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3435) bootstrap is better more responsive and when i refresh my page

- [00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3439) and when i refresh my page okay you see this is the

- [00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3441) okay you see this is the output of table and this is the output

- [00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3443) output of table and this is the output of bootstrap

- [00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3445) of bootstrap let's also add them some border how am i

- [00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3448) let's also add them some border how am i gonna add that i am going to add

- [00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3451) gonna add that i am going to add something like this so each td

- [00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3455) something like this so each td will have

- [00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3456) will have a border

- [00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3458) a border style

- [00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3459) style this is also not

- [00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3462) this is also not suggested

- [00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3469) you should use the classes of booster but for demonstration proposes

- [00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3472) booster but for demonstration proposes i'm going to have that so in here i will

- [00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3476) i'm going to have that so in here i will also add a border and border

- [00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3480) also add a border and border to yeah

- [00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3483) to yeah actually i can also change it as

- [00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3487) actually i can also change it as container class

- [00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3497) inside containers yeah each

- [00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3499) yeah each div

- [00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3500) div will have a border

- [00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3503) will have a border or maybe on the row yeah let's set it on

- [00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3506) or maybe on the row yeah let's set it on the row

- [00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3512) and i will add borders

- [00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3526) okay this is not possible appending it like that i need to set it like this

- [00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3535) okay and let's refresh our age

- [00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3537) age okay

- [00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3538) okay oh by the way the td didn't work because

- [00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3541) oh by the way the td didn't work because it is not a class it is like this

- [00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3554) all the way on pixel

- [00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3559) okay so this is the default output of table

- [00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3561) so this is the default output of table and this is the default output of

- [00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3564) and this is the default output of bootstrap when i change size

- [00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3567) bootstrap when i change size you see how boots up uh

- [00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3570) you see how boots up uh [Music]

- [00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3571) [Music] borders with changes

- [00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3573) borders with changes it is always single line and this is the

- [00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3576) it is always single line and this is the minimum width that you can get with

- [00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3579) minimum width that you can get with bootstrap

- [00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3585) and it is you see changing time size according to the screen size

- [00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3589) size according to the screen size and when i remove one of the column here

- [00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3594) and when i remove one of the column here since it is a

- [00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3597) since it is a default container

- [00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3599) default container i think people better able to better see

- [01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3602) i think people better able to better see it

- [01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3608) okay it is taking 100 percent one

- [01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3610) 100 percent one when the size gate blows

- [01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3613) when the size gate blows 576

- [01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3615) 576 otherwise it is getting

- [01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3617) otherwise it is getting certain

- [01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3619) certain sizes

- [01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3621) sizes since this is behaving at a small but if

- [01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3624) since this is behaving at a small but if i change this to

- [01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3632) like this the behavior will also change

- [01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3643) so you see now it becomes full size at a bigger size

- [01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3646) full size at a bigger size okay

- [01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3647) okay so these are all about breakpoints

- [01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3650) so these are all about breakpoints containers and rows

- [01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3652) containers and rows let's add another router here

- [01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3655) let's add another router here and let's make it three columns

- [01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3662) and see how it behaves like this

- [01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3664) like this okay when i refresh you see this one has

- [01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3667) okay when i refresh you see this one has two columns and this one has three

- [01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3669) two columns and this one has three columns

- [01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3670) columns okay

- [01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3672) okay it is totally up to you you can also

- [01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3674) it is totally up to you you can also define different

- [01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3676) define different i think

- [01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3677) i think container sizes

- [01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3680) container sizes such as

- [01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3682) such as let's see

- [01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3685) let's see rose columns

- [01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3696) yeah so i'm going to make this as small

- [01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3697) small small three columns here

- [01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3703) so the above one and the below one will be different

- [01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3704) be different you see

- [01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3709) like this oh i made this just

- [01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3711) oh i made this just three columns

- [01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3713) three columns so

- [01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3714) so you can also have nested containers if

- [01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3717) you can also have nested containers if you want

- [01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3722) let's nest this inside in other containers

- [01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3728) like this and i will make this a small container here

- [01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3731) container here okay

- [01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3733) okay and let's replace the page

- [01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3735) and let's replace the page okay you see now they have different

- [01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3738) okay you see now they have different container sizes

- [01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3740) container sizes and they will become equal after certain

- [01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3744) and they will become equal after certain size and since it is small to be like

- [01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3746) size and since it is small to be like this

- [01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3760) the above example creates three equal width columns across all devices and

- [01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3762) width columns across all devices and viewports using our predefined grid

- [01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3764) viewports using our predefined grid classes

- [01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3765) classes those columns are centered in the page

- [01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3767) those columns are centered in the page with the parent dot container

- [01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3769) with the parent dot container so the dot container centers them inside

- [01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3772) so the dot container centers them inside the page you see this is it is always in

- [01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3775) the page you see this is it is always in center at the page

- [01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3778) center at the page the containers are always centered at

- [01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3780) the containers are always centered at the page yeah

- [01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3783) the page yeah how it works

- [01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3785) how it works breaking it down here's how the grid

- [01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3787) breaking it down here's how the grid system comes together

- [01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3789) system comes together our grid supports six responsive break

- [01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3792) our grid supports six responsive break points

- [01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3793) points breakpoints are based on min with media

- [01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3795) breakpoints are based on min with media queries meaning they affect the break

- [01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3797) queries meaning they affect the break point and all those above it example dot

- [01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3800) point and all those above it example dot call sm for applies to sm md lg xl and

- [01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3804) call sm for applies to sm md lg xl and xxl

- [01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3898) up to one of three like this and

- [01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3900) and let's see

- [01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3901) let's see okay let's test this

- [01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3906) let's see how it behaves so i will put it to the top

- [01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3920) okay let's refresh

- [01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3938) refreshing is taking a lot of time on my computer however if your computer is

- [01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3940) computer however if your computer is faster it should be much faster

- [01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3943) faster it should be much faster than my computer

- [01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3950) yeah taking a lot of time this is actually a bad

- [01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3951) actually a bad it's only bad site i have seen with

- [01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3954) it's only bad site i have seen with asp.net mvc core

- [01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3956) asp.net mvc core on a web forms application refresh is

- [01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3959) on a web forms application refresh is almost instant

- [01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3961) almost instant uh if you are working with uh

- [01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3964) uh if you are working with uh aspx

- [01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3966) aspx pages

- [01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=3976) gone i don't know why it took this much time

- [01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4028) okay um you see one of three two of three

- [01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4031) you see one of three two of three three or three but since there is no

- [01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4035) three or three but since there is no borders we can see it

- [01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4038) borders we can see it but here it is displayed order let's see

- [01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4040) but here it is displayed order let's see the page source

- [01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4047) okay they have

- [01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4048) they have [Music]

- [01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4050) [Music] necessity example raw

- [01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4053) necessity example raw class

- [01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4055) class and let's see the video example

- [01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4081) okay let's put it inside in the example i wonder if that is a

- [01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4083) i wonder if that is a default class of

- [01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4085) default class of bullstrap

- [01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4095) okay it doesn't have the path class so

- [01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4096) so i have to have

- [01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4098) i have to have let's define a custom class to add

- [01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4100) let's define a custom class to add borders

- [01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4103) borders order class

- [01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4104) order class and inside border class basically

- [01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4109) and inside border class basically i will have

- [01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4110) i will have all these to have a border

- [01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4114) all these to have a border like this yeah

- [01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4116) like this yeah now i should be able to okay

- [01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4119) now i should be able to okay so one of three two of three but this

- [01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4121) so one of three two of three but this one is wider three of three

- [01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4123) one is wider three of three one of three two of three dividers

- [01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4126) one of three two of three dividers three of three so why they are different

- [01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4129) three of three so why they are different you see

- [01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4130) you see let's check it out so at the first row

- [01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4133) let's check it out so at the first row which is here

- [01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4135) which is here uh this one has

- [01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4137) uh this one has six

- [01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4138) six uh and you see so it will take six

- [01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4141) uh and you see so it will take six column size and these two will take

- [01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4147) okay it is not six column size but let's see why there

- [01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4150) six column size but let's see why there is a such difference

- [01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4167) so it is total number of twelve column therefore this will get three this will

- [01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4170) therefore this will get three this will get three and this will get six that's

- [01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4172) get three and this will get six that's how it is happening if i make this 7 8 i

- [01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4176) how it is happening if i make this 7 8 i mean this will get 2 and this will get

- [01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4179) mean this will get 2 and this will get 2. let's test it out

- [01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4181) 2. let's test it out you see so we can also check their size

- [01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4184) you see so we can also check their size to verify our

- [01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4186) to verify our example so this is this has

- [01:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4191) example so this is this has let's see

- [01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4193) let's see okay uh 220 pixel size this has

- [01:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4198) okay uh 220 pixel size this has 880 pixel size which is four times of

- [01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4202) 880 pixel size which is four times of that

- [01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4203) that and this one is 220 so our uh

- [01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4208) and this one is 220 so our uh assumption is working

- [01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4211) assumption is working okay this gets a 2x

- [01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4214) okay this gets a 2x column

- [01:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4216) column okay this is

- [01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4218) okay this is 8x column

- [01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4226) this is 2x column and total column is fast yeah

- [01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4228) is fast yeah this is the container

- [01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4231) this is the container column system let's comment this out

- [01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4241) and it is same here so since this is 5 this gets

- [01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4244) so since this is 5 this gets four and it gets three i think or do

- [01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4246) four and it gets three i think or do they get equal baby

- [01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4249) they get equal baby let's see

- [01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4255) so this one is 383

- [01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4256) 383 [Music]

- [01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4259) [Music] okay so in this case

- [01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4262) okay so in this case you see since this is a single number

- [01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4264) you see since this is a single number and eight left

- [01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4267) and eight left this will get

- [01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4268) this will get [Music]

- [01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4270) [Music] 3.5 x

- [01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4273) 3.5 x yeah

- [01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4275) yeah and this is 3.5

- [01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4278) and this is 3.5 and this is

- [01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4279) and this is five

- [01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4281) five okay

- [01:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4282) okay and let's continue

- [01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4295) variable width content use call dash breakpoint auto classes to

- [01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4298) use call dash breakpoint auto classes to size columns based on the natural width

- [01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4300) size columns based on the natural width of their content

- [01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4302) of their content so this will set them based on their

- [01:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4304) so this will set them based on their natural bit of their content

- [01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4306) natural bit of their content which is this let's

- [01:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4309) which is this let's see that

- [01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4310) see that as an example

- [01:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4322) okay variable bits i will make this double

- [01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4328) okay let's see how it works so this has auto tech as you can see

- [01:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4332) so this has auto tech as you can see and these two have two column size

- [01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4335) and these two have two column size large but they are they have breakpoint

- [01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4337) large but they are they have breakpoint of large

- [01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4338) of large and this is a great point of medium

- [01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4342) and this is a great point of medium and let's see the example

- [01:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4345) and let's see the example okay uh by the way

- [01:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4356) since this is inside this is not inside our border class

- [01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4358) our border class i'm going to make my border class here

- [01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4361) i'm going to make my border class here it will

- [01:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4363) it will [Music]

- [01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4371) it will cover all of our big examples okay

- [01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4374) examples okay so one of three

- [01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4375) so one of three variable content three of three

- [01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4379) variable content three of three one of three variable bit content three

- [01:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4382) one of three variable bit content three of three

- [01:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4383) of three why they are like this if you wonder

- [01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4390) here's this is using default column

- [01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4400) therefore it is taking all the remaining uh width which is nine

- [01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4404) uh width which is nine this is the variable width it only takes

- [01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4407) this is the variable width it only takes the size of

- [01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4409) the size of the content

- [01:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4410) the content you can see here

- [01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4412) you can see here and they are getting the rest

- [01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4416) and they are getting the rest we can

- [01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4417) we can make this also

- [01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4418) make this also like this let me show you

- [01:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4425) so if i add example like this and if i

- [01:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4427) if i add example like this and if i don't define anything

- [01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4433) okay this will take whatever space necessary

- [01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4435) necessary and the rest will get automatically

- [01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4445) okay you see variable bits but they are almost equal therefore i will make this

- [01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4456) let's see i will make this even bigger it happens

- [01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4462) okay now it is taking much more content than this yeah

- [01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4464) than this yeah so auto working well

- [01:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4466) so auto working well um you can also set this as large

- [01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4471) um you can also set this as large but large wouldn't change anything

- [01:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4473) but large wouldn't change anything because it is this is taking the entire

- [01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4475) because it is this is taking the entire space

- [01:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4477) space if i make this as

- [01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4479) if i make this as small

- [01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4480) small that may make them smaller though

- [01:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4489) okay didn't make my stiffness if there's a smoother

- [01:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4492) a smoother yeah xml make

- [01:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4494) yeah xml make can make a difference

- [01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4497) can make a difference let's try x

- [01:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4499) let's try x small

- [01:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4510) oh when i make it it's small now it is spawning into the

- [01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4513) now it is spawning into the next yeah

- [01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4560) responsive classes bootstrap's grid includes six tiers of

- [01:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4562) bootstrap's grid includes six tiers of predefined classes for building complex

- [01:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4564) predefined classes for building complex responsive layouts

- [01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4566) responsive layouts customize the size of your columns on

- [01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4568) customize the size of your columns on extra small small medium large or extra

- [01:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4571) extra small small medium large or extra large devices however you see fit

- [01:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4574) large devices however you see fit all break points

- [01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4577) all break points for grids that are the same from the

- [01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4578) for grids that are the same from the smallest of devices to the largest use

- [01:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4580) smallest of devices to the largest use the dot call and dot call dash asterisk

- [01:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4583) the dot call and dot call dash asterisk classes

- [01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4584) classes specify a numbered class when you need a

- [01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4586) specify a numbered class when you need a particularly sized column otherwise feel

- [01:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4589) particularly sized column otherwise feel free to stick to dot call

- [01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4591) free to stick to dot call so that column is what we need usually

- [01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4594) so that column is what we need usually but if you need certain sizes then you

- [01:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4596) but if you need certain sizes then you can use other breakpoints

- [01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4599) can use other breakpoints so this will have

- [01:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4602) so this will have default

- [01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4603) default sizes

- [01:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4606) sizes okay let's add some breakpoints

- [01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4613) okay and when i refresh i think it will take

- [01:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4616) and when i refresh i think it will take entire available space like this

- [01:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4619) entire available space like this column column column eight column four

- [01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4622) column column column eight column four column

- [01:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4623) column and when i make it smaller it will gets

- [01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4625) and when i make it smaller it will gets automatically sized according to our

- [01:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4629) automatically sized according to our page you see

- [01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4631) page you see since none of them is uh

- [01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4634) since none of them is uh surpassing the available

- [01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4637) surpassing the available it didn't respond to the next line when

- [01:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4639) it didn't respond to the next line when i make it like this it is still working

- [01:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4642) i make it like this it is still working yeah

- [01:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4643) yeah if i make this world very big what

- [01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4646) if i make this world very big what happens like this

- [01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4661) okay you see now it is spawning to the next line still it is responsive fully

- [01:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4664) next line still it is responsive fully visible

- [01:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4665) visible and it is pointing to the next line now

- [01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4669) and it is pointing to the next line now this row is actually two rows

- [01:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4673) this row is actually two rows to ensure that it is

- [01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4675) to ensure that it is responsive but when the size gets big

- [01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4678) responsive but when the size gets big enough now it is returning back to the

- [01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4680) enough now it is returning back to the single rope as you can see

- [01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4698) a new role when the screen side is too small to

- [01:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4701) side is too small to display a single word

- [01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4704) display a single word yeah okay

- [01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4713) okay so stick it to horizontal

- [01:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4716) stick it to horizontal okay

- [01:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4722) using a single set of dot call s and dash asterisk classes you can create a

- [01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4724) dash asterisk classes you can create a basic grid system that starts out

- [01:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4726) basic grid system that starts out stacked and becomes horizontal at the

- [01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4728) stacked and becomes horizontal at the small breakpoint sm

- [01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4731) small breakpoint sm okay let's uh

- [01:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4733) okay let's uh see the difference of this

- [01:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4738) okay by the i think from horizontal it means

- [01:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4741) by the i think from horizontal it means um

- [01:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4743) um this you see it is taking

- [01:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4747) this you see it is taking into multiple rows spanning into

- [01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4749) into multiple rows spanning into multiple rows

- [01:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4752) multiple rows okay let's add that

- [01:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4754) okay let's add that as well

- [01:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4762) so we have a container class then we have two rows with

- [01:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4765) have two rows with eight and four columns and three columns

- [01:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4775) okay let's see the behaviors yeah i see

- [01:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4777) yeah i see so you see now they are all spawning

- [01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4779) so you see now they are all spawning into single

- [01:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4781) into single row do you know why

- [01:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4783) row do you know why because

- [01:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4789) they are small

- [01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4790) small break point

- [01:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4792) break point if i remove the small break point let's

- [01:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4794) if i remove the small break point let's see what happens

- [01:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4800) okay so you see if i remove the small break points they are still in as a

- [01:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4802) break points they are still in as a single uh row like this

- [01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4806) single uh row like this but as soon as we uh

- [01:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4808) but as soon as we uh at the small

- [01:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4810) at the small the behavior changes let's add another

- [01:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4813) the behavior changes let's add another one

- [01:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4814) one uh to see at a single

- [01:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4816) uh to see at a single example

- [01:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4818) example like this

- [01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4819) like this so the break points have huge effect

- [01:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4822) so the break points have huge effect when they become

- [01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4832) stack as horizontal or not so let's try for example

- [01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4840) x-large breakpoint okay

- [01:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4849) x large small uh this will be regular column

- [01:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4858) okay yes um yeah let's see the difference okay

- [01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4860) let's see the difference okay so

- [01:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4861) so the touch is uh

- [01:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4865) the touch is uh spanning

- [01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4866) spanning into the

- [01:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4868) into the [Music]

- [01:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4870) [Music] different rows as soon as the screen

- [01:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4873) different rows as soon as the screen size is getting let's open inspector to

- [01:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4877) size is getting let's open inspector to see

- [01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4886) [Music] 200

- [01:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4889) 200 yeah 1200

- [01:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4890) yeah 1200 that is the breakpoint of x-large and as

- [01:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4893) that is the breakpoint of x-large and as soon as the sequences get blows it they

- [01:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4896) soon as the sequences get blows it they are spawning into the multiple roles

- [01:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4899) are spawning into the multiple roles and the x-large and the small is

- [01:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4901) and the x-large and the small is spanning into multiple rows as soon as

- [01:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4903) spanning into multiple rows as soon as the screen size is below

- [01:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4905) the screen size is below 570

- [01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4908) 570 576

- [01:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4911) 576 you see current to 576 as soon as i get

- [01:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4913) you see current to 576 as soon as i get to

- [01:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4914) to 575 they are spawning into the

- [01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4918) 575 they are spawning into the multiple row okay

- [01:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4932) mix and match don't want your columns to simply stack

- [01:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4934) don't want your columns to simply stack in some grid tiers

- [01:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4936) in some grid tiers use a combination of different classes

- [01:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4938) use a combination of different classes for each tier as needed

- [01:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4940) for each tier as needed see the example below for a better idea

- [01:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4942) see the example below for a better idea of how it all works

- [01:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4944) of how it all works okay so let's copy and paste this as

- [01:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4947) okay so let's copy and paste this as well to analyze

- [01:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4959) okay so we have container and we have row and we have md8 we have column six

- [01:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4963) row and we have md8 we have column six and column md4 so you see this is a

- [01:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4967) and column md4 so you see this is a mix it

- [01:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4969) mix it i think when the breakpoint is medium it

- [01:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4971) i think when the breakpoint is medium it will become four

- [01:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4973) will become four and on uh before that it will be six

- [01:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4977) and on uh before that it will be six probably

- [01:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4983) and then we have column six and md md4

- [01:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4991) columns start at 50 percent fight on mobile

- [01:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=4994) 50 percent fight on mobile on mobile means nd

- [01:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5008) okay let's test this let's see the behavior

- [01:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5009) behavior so at full size

- [01:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5011) so at full size we see this is taking eight this is

- [01:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5014) we see this is taking eight this is taking

- [01:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5016) taking a half of it because

- [01:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5019) a half of it because it is bigger than the md probably

- [01:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5028) md is medium breakpoint so this is

- [01:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5029) so this is uh

- [01:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5031) uh 877 pixel and this is

- [01:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5038) okay 400 so this is 2x this is 1x

- [01:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5040) 2x this is 1x these three are equal i think

- [01:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5043) these three are equal i think when we are bigger than md

- [01:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5046) when we are bigger than md it is taking as effect

- [01:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5049) it is taking as effect though i am not sure let's see

- [01:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5052) though i am not sure let's see okay this is taking eight coulomb is

- [01:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5054) okay this is taking eight coulomb is taking four column

- [01:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5057) taking four column and these two are equal

- [01:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5059) and these two are equal and let's see when we start making the

- [01:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5061) and let's see when we start making the screen smaller how the behavior changes

- [01:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5065) screen smaller how the behavior changes okay here the behavior changes

- [01:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5069) okay here the behavior changes okay what point is that

- [01:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5083) okay as soon as we get below 1200 the behavior changes yeah

- [01:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5087) the behavior changes yeah like this

- [01:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5089) like this and when we get even smaller the

- [01:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5092) and when we get even smaller the behavior changes are

- [01:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5095) behavior changes are [Music]

- [01:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5096) [Music] after 1000 pixels yeah

- [01:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5100) after 1000 pixels yeah or 909

- [01:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5103) or 909 100

- [01:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5130) okay it says columns start at fifty percent white on mobile and we see that

- [01:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5134) percent white on mobile and we see that it is fifty percent percent white on

- [01:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5136) it is fifty percent percent white on mobile they are all equal but spanning

- [01:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5139) mobile they are all equal but spanning into multiple

- [01:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5141) into multiple roles

- [01:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5142) roles and

- [01:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5144) and on desktop

- [01:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5146) on desktop you see

- [01:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5147) you see they are becoming equal

- [01:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5149) they are becoming equal 33 percent

- [01:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5151) 33 percent 60 columns on mobile by making one full

- [01:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5153) 60 columns on mobile by making one full bit and they have it

- [01:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5159) so let's see this one behavior okay i see

- [01:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5161) see so you see on mobile this is a full size

- [01:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5164) so you see on mobile this is a full size eight column

- [01:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5166) eight column and this is half size

- [01:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5169) and this is half size and

- [01:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5191) yeah okay so

- [01:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5193) okay so md4 and md8 makes it

- [01:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5197) md4 and md8 makes it this is 2x and this

- [01:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5200) this is 2x and this 4x

- [01:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5201) 4x and what does this means that it will

- [01:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5204) and what does this means that it will not

- [01:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5205) not spawn to do it will not

- [01:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5208) spawn to do it will not take entire space of

- [01:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5210) take entire space of one rope even

- [01:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5212) one rope even uh

- [01:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5213) uh in mobile like this you see it is half

- [01:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5216) in mobile like this you see it is half size of the entire row

- [01:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5218) size of the entire row and this is what it does column six okay

- [01:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5230) okay you can do tests at your computer as well to

- [01:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5233) do tests at your computer as well to understand how it works better

- [01:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5235) understand how it works better it is simple

- [01:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5237) it is simple okay

- [01:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5243) row columns use the responsive dot roll calls dash

- [01:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5245) use the responsive dot roll calls dash asterisk classes to quickly set the

- [01:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5247) asterisk classes to quickly set the number of columns that best render your

- [01:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5249) number of columns that best render your content and layout

- [01:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5251) content and layout whereas normal.call dash asterisk

- [01:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5253) whereas normal.call dash asterisk classes apply to the individual columns

- [01:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5255) classes apply to the individual columns example dot call nd4 the row columns

- [01:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5259) example dot call nd4 the row columns classes are set on the parent dot row as

- [01:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5261) classes are set on the parent dot row as a shortcut

- [01:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5262) a shortcut with dot roll calls auto you can give

- [01:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5264) with dot roll calls auto you can give the columns their natural width

- [01:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5267) the columns their natural width use these row columns classes to quickly

- [01:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5269) use these row columns classes to quickly create basic grid layouts or to control

- [01:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5272) create basic grid layouts or to control your card layouts

- [01:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5273) your card layouts okay so here it will set

- [01:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5276) okay so here it will set two columns for parallel

- [01:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5301) okay they are equal and when we get too small

- [01:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5307) okay so you see they are spawning into multiple rows

- [01:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5311) they are spawning into multiple rows when it becomes too small

- [01:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5314) when it becomes too small um [Music]

- [01:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5319) oh i think let's add two more columns to test

- [01:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5326) yeah so this means there will be maximum two

- [01:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5331) so this means there will be maximum two columns first row writing here

- [01:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5334) columns first row writing here yeah this is simply meaning that that it

- [01:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5337) yeah this is simply meaning that that it means there will be two columns when i

- [01:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5339) means there will be two columns when i set this three it there will be three

- [01:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5341) set this three it there will be three columns per row like this

- [01:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5344) columns per row like this and they will always be

- [01:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5346) and they will always be uh taking the full size like this it's

- [01:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5349) uh taking the full size like this it's pretty convenient to use

- [01:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5357) and you can also set different number of row columns or

- [01:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5360) row columns or anything then there is also auto means

- [01:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5362) anything then there is also auto means that i think each one of them will be

- [01:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5365) that i think each one of them will be respond to the single

- [01:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5380) oh they are not even taking the entire space now

- [01:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5381) space now so this means that they are getting

- [01:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5384) so this means that they are getting space according to

- [01:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5386) space according to their natural uh content size like this

- [01:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5391) their natural uh content size like this and when we make it smaller they will

- [01:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5393) and when we make it smaller they will just uh spawn into the multiple rows

- [01:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5395) just uh spawn into the multiple rows like here

- [01:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5403) okay okay

- [01:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5404) okay so can we change behavior like this

- [01:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5408) so can we change behavior like this this is something interesting let's see

- [01:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5412) this is something interesting let's see what if we set

- [01:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5413) what if we set a

- [01:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5414) a call

- [01:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5415) call column

- [01:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5416) column number like here what happens

- [01:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5432) of other columns or what oh i think uh each one of these columns

- [01:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5435) oh i think uh each one of these columns now taking 2x space this one is taking

- [01:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5438) now taking 2x space this one is taking six space so it will be three x size of

- [01:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5441) six space so it will be three x size of them

- [01:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5443) them let's verify our theory

- [01:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5445) let's verify our theory uh this is 284

- [01:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5453) uh 284 and this should be equal to 600 or 700 uh

- [01:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5457) or 700 uh oh

- [01:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5459) oh 200 yeah this is just uh

- [01:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5465) okay i think it is behaving like this let me

- [01:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5467) i think it is behaving like this let me explain

- [01:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5468) explain so this becomes uh

- [01:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5471) so this becomes uh 3x

- [01:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5473) 3x this becomes 3x and this is 6x because

- [01:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5476) this becomes 3x and this is 6x because each

- [01:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5477) each [Music]

- [01:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5484) okay this is not but it happens this is four columns

- [01:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5487) this is four columns and

- [01:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5488) and so it should be 3x

- [01:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5490) so it should be 3x size

- [01:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5507) is it's explain it here no

- [01:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5534) um i think i know the reason okay so these

- [01:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5537) i think i know the reason okay so these are being um

- [01:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5539) are being um [Music]

- [01:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5540) [Music] 3x3 x3 xy

- [01:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5543) 3x3 x3 xy since this is four columns uh it is

- [01:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5547) since this is four columns uh it is taking uh 3x over 12x

- [01:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5556) is four columns yeah

- [01:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5557) yeah so therefore three

- [01:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5559) so therefore three x663x and

- [01:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5561) x663x and since they

- [01:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5564) since they get over

- [01:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5565) get over 12 x it is always spawning into the next

- [01:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5569) 12 x it is always spawning into the next row like here

- [01:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5571) row like here we can also add a node

- [01:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5582) the last column

- [01:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5584) column always spawn into the next row

- [01:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5593) actually we can say extend maybe not spawn but extend

- [01:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5611) so this three is being the first row and this is getting extended into the next

- [01:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5613) this is getting extended into the next row like here

- [01:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5617) row like here okay the idea is simple you know as you

- [01:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5620) okay the idea is simple you know as you work with this system you will get user

- [01:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5623) work with this system you will get user teeth you will understand it better

- [01:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5625) teeth you will understand it better and what about this

- [01:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5648) row columns one sm two okay so this means that

- [01:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5649) means that by default it will be

- [01:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5652) by default it will be one column

- [01:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5655) one column and if it is bigger than a small break

- [01:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5658) and if it is bigger than a small break point it will be two column and if it is

- [01:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5660) point it will be two column and if it is bigger than four

- [01:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5662) bigger than four break point it will be four cone you see

- [01:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5664) break point it will be four cone you see since it is bigger than md breakpoint it

- [01:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5667) since it is bigger than md breakpoint it is now four column and as soon as i

- [01:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5670) is now four column and as soon as i start a

- [01:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5671) start a minimizing it it will become true column

- [01:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5673) minimizing it it will become true column and then it will become one column

- [01:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5676) and then it will become one column let me show you

- [01:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5682) [Music] now two columns uh when it becomes two

- [01:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5684) now two columns uh when it becomes two column it becomes two column after

- [01:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5688) column it becomes two column after um

- [01:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5690) um 700

- [01:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5692) 700 686

- [01:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5694) 686 which is the breakpoint of md

- [01:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5696) which is the breakpoint of md when you get

- [01:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5698) when you get below md it becomes uh two columns

- [01:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5701) below md it becomes uh two columns and when it gets

- [01:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5702) and when it gets below sm

- [01:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5704) below sm uh

- [01:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5705) uh it becomes

- [01:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5708) it becomes one column like this so this defines

- [01:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5712) one column like this so this defines okay this defines the behavior

- [01:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5715) okay this defines the behavior according uh

- [01:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5718) according uh to the screen size if screen size is

- [01:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5722) to the screen size if screen size is bigger than

- [01:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5724) bigger than md

- [01:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5726) md in

- [01:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5727) in pixel it is

- [01:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5730) pixel it is four columns

- [01:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5731) four columns if it is bigger than

- [01:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5735) if it is bigger than excel

- [01:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5736) excel it is too cool

- [01:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5739) it is too cool and if screen is smaller

- [01:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5746) and okay it is

- [01:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5752) one con okay

- [01:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5759) so this is about uh sequin sizes you see how it changes

- [01:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5770) this is also being a responsive design in a single

- [01:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5772) in a single line of code you can set

- [01:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5775) line of code you can set behavior of the container according to

- [01:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5778) behavior of the container according to the screen size

- [01:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5785) okay and then there is nesting i am just passing the s-a-s-s

- [01:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5792) nesting to nest your content with the default

- [01:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5794) to nest your content with the default grid add a new dot row instead of dot

- [01:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5796) grid add a new dot row instead of dot col sm asterisk columns within an

- [01:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5799) col sm asterisk columns within an existing dot call sm asterisk column

- [01:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5802) existing dot call sm asterisk column nested rows should include a set of

- [01:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5804) nested rows should include a set of columns that add up to 12 or fewer it is

- [01:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5807) columns that add up to 12 or fewer it is not required that you use all 12

- [01:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5808) not required that you use all 12 available columns

- [01:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5810) available columns okay let's see a nested column example

- [01:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5813) okay let's see a nested column example as well nested

- [01:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5815) as well nested container

- [01:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5823) okay so here we have a container we have a row which is the beginning row

- [01:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5825) a row which is the beginning row then we have a column which is three

- [01:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5828) then we have a column which is three column uh when screen is bigger than sm

- [01:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5832) column uh when screen is bigger than sm then we have sm9

- [01:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5835) then we have sm9 then inside that we have another row and

- [01:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5837) then inside that we have another row and this row spawns into multiple columns

- [01:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5840) this row spawns into multiple columns according to the screen sizes like this

- [01:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5843) according to the screen sizes like this so

- [01:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5844) so it will be printed like

- [01:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5848) it will be printed like it will save it no let's

- [01:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5851) it will save it no let's save

- [01:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5856) okay it is like this they are nested and as soon as we

- [01:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5858) as soon as we start changing the

- [01:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5860) start changing the screen size the display behavior changes

- [01:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5863) screen size the display behavior changes according to the setup we made

- [01:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5867) according to the setup we made so it is totally up to you how you want

- [01:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5869) so it is totally up to you how you want it to be displayed

- [01:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5876) we are not going to use sass then we have mixings okay we are not going to

- [01:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5878) have mixings okay we are not going to use that as well

- [01:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5880) use that as well we have

- [01:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5899) okay let's move to the next which is columns we already have a lot of idea

- [01:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5901) columns we already have a lot of idea about columns

- [01:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5910) columns learn how to modify columns with a

- [01:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5912) learn how to modify columns with a handful of options for alignment

- [01:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5914) handful of options for alignment ordering and offsetting thanks to our

- [01:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5916) ordering and offsetting thanks to our flexbox grid system

- [01:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5918) flexbox grid system plus see how to use column classes to

- [01:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5920) plus see how to use column classes to manage widths of non-grid elements

- [01:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5928) okay be sure to read grid first we have read it already

- [01:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5931) read it already how they work

- [01:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5934) how they work columns build on the grid's flexbox

- [01:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5937) columns build on the grid's flexbox flexbox means we have options for

- [01:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5939) flexbox means we have options for changing individual columns and

- [01:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5941) changing individual columns and modifying groups of columns at the row

- [01:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5943) modifying groups of columns at the row level

- [01:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5944) level you choose how columns grow shrink or

- [01:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5947) you choose how columns grow shrink or otherwise change

- [01:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5952) when building grid layouts all content goes in columns

- [01:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5953) goes in columns the hierarchy of bootstrap's grid goes

- [01:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5956) the hierarchy of bootstrap's grid goes from container to row to column to your

- [01:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5958) from container to row to column to your content okay so it starts with container

- [01:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5960) content okay so it starts with container then row then column this is the order

- [01:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5963) then row then column this is the order of a grid system

- [01:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5965) of a grid system it is uh important to understand first

- [01:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5967) it is uh important to understand first container then we have rows and then we

- [01:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5969) container then we have rows and then we have columns

- [01:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5972) have columns on rare occasions you may combine

- [01:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5974) on rare occasions you may combine content and column but be aware there

- [01:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5976) content and column but be aware there can be unintended consequences

- [01:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5978) can be unintended consequences so you shouldn't just combine content

- [01:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5980) so you shouldn't just combine content and column you should always use raw and

- [01:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5982) and column you should always use raw and column

- [01:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5988) bootstrap includes predefined classes for creating fast responsive layouts

- [01:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5991) for creating fast responsive layouts with six break points and a dozen

- [01:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5993) with six break points and a dozen columns at each grid tier we have dozens

- [01:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5995) columns at each grid tier we have dozens of classes already built for you to

- [01:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5997) of classes already built for you to create your desired layouts

- [01:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=5999) create your desired layouts this can

- [01:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=6000) this can okay

- [01:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=6001) okay and we can say we can remember the

- [01:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=6003) and we can say we can remember the breakpoints again so if if screen size

- [01:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=6006) breakpoints again so if if screen size dimension is smaller than 576 it is x

- [01:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=6010) dimension is smaller than 576 it is x small

- [01:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=6011) small then we have small sm

- [01:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=6014) then we have small sm we have md medium lg large

- [01:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=6017) we have md medium lg large extra large is x large and extra extra

- [01:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=6020) extra large is x large and extra extra large is xx large okay

- [01:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=6027) and then let's start with alignment alignment

- [01:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=6029) alignment use flexbox alignment utilities to

- [01:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=6031) use flexbox alignment utilities to vertically and horizontally align

- [01:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=6033) vertically and horizontally align columns

- [01:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=6034) columns this is vertical alignment let's

- [01:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=6038) this is vertical alignment let's see it

- [01:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=6052) okay so here we start with the container then we have a row alignment item start

- [01:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=6057) then we have a row alignment item start we have three columns

- [01:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=6059) we have three columns which will take the entire available

- [01:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=6061) which will take the entire available space

- [01:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=6062) space and they won't spawn into the they won't

- [01:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=6065) and they won't spawn into the they won't extend into the another row

- [01:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=6068) extend into the another row we have alignment item centers

- [01:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=6071) we have alignment item centers and we have alignments items and i think

- [01:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=6073) and we have alignments items and i think this is left alignment this is center

- [01:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=6076) this is left alignment this is center and this is the right alignment

- [01:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=6078) and this is the right alignment let's see

- [01:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=6084) okay text is alignment here okay not about text and what then what is that

- [01:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=6086) about text and what then what is that about

- [01:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=6093) okay they look exactly the same interesting so what is the difference

- [01:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=6113) okay the thing here is you see each one is never but

- [01:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=6115) is never but yeah they are each one is never

- [01:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=6118) yeah they are each one is never i think it defines the orders

- [01:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=6130) uh this is starting center and that one is and when i move this

- [01:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=6134) is and when i move this and i start let's see what happens

- [01:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=6142) okay um it is exactly looking same

- [01:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=6146) um it is exactly looking same let's make this and

- [01:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=6153) okay nothing changes so align items and what does that mean

- [01:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=6181) let's continue with next one i think we will understand it better that time

- [01:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=6194) okay we have a single row we have self start self center

- [01:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=6197) start self center south and

- [01:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=6199) south and remember refresh the page it is still

- [01:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=6202) remember refresh the page it is still looking same

- [01:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=6209) it is always looking same we don't get the behavior hereby

- [01:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=6225) i think to be able to get the behavior here

- [01:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=6226) here we need to have

- [01:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=6234) um some kind of bigger with hate

- [01:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=6236) with hate so let's change hate of these containers

- [01:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=6240) so let's change hate of these containers i wonder if there's a hate

- [01:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=6242) i wonder if there's a hate class or something like that

- [01:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=6245) class or something like that no

- [01:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=6246) no so let's add a head

- [01:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=6253) 500 pixel and let's add a head to this one as well

- [01:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=6281) um let's check the examples source code

- [01:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=6291) because we don't see the same

- [01:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=6332) so you see it has spd example class which is position relative

- [01:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=6341) it has some margin border but it is not explaining it

- [01:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=6344) explaining it we have container here's rows

- [01:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=6353) why the size of this row is like this

- [01:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=6385) yeah this is for these

- [01:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=6471) so display flex makes a difference but what is making it like this

- [01:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=6483) oh it has mean head which is coming from here

- [01:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=6489) you see and it is coming from box css yeah i see

- [01:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=6492) and it is coming from box css yeah i see so until i add this into my row then i

- [01:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=6496) so until i add this into my row then i won't see the same behavior

- [01:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=6498) won't see the same behavior to be able to see the same behavior

- [01:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=6506) i need to make change add a style here like this

- [01:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=6509) like this now i will see same behavior i think

- [01:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=6511) now i will see same behavior i think this is the misleading

- [01:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=6514) this is the misleading because if you don't use the same

- [01:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=6522) classes as example it's okay now we can see it you see

- [01:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=6524) see it you see they are now like this

- [01:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=6527) they are now like this so this is

- [01:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=6528) so this is setting their position

- [01:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=6530) setting their position uh inside row

- [01:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=6532) uh inside row so this is the row style it is 108 pixel

- [01:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=6536) so this is the row style it is 108 pixel and

- [01:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=6537) and this is where they are positioned you

- [01:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=6539) this is where they are positioned you see start

- [01:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=6542) see start center end

- [01:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=6544) center end and we have

- [01:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=6550) another example here okay let's set every one of them

- [01:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=6561) okay so this one is top they are positioned at the top this one is they

- [01:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=6563) positioned at the top this one is they are positioned at center and this one is

- [01:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=6565) are positioned at center and this one is they are positioned at the bottom

- [01:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=6568) they are positioned at the bottom okay

- [01:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=6569) okay um

- [01:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=6570) um let's continue with the

- [01:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=6573) let's continue with the tutorial

- [01:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=6575) tutorial then we can have horizontal alignment

- [01:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=6577) then we can have horizontal alignment you see you can align that

- [01:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=6579) you see you can align that wherever you want like this

- [01:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=6586) just right content start just for content centers

- [01:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=6589) content centers justify content and around

- [01:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=6593) justify content and around content between

- [01:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=6596) content between you see how they are getting positioned

- [01:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=6602) evenly we can also apply this let me show you

- [01:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=6604) we can also apply this let me show you how can i apply this quickly

- [01:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=6610) okay um so

- [01:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=6612) so i'm going to give this

- [01:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=6614) i'm going to give this class another name like

- [01:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=6618) class another name like um

- [01:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=6619) um row size

- [01:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=6621) row size and from this row size

- [01:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=6623) and from this row size i am just going to use row size class

- [01:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=6626) i am just going to use row size class dot rows

- [01:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=6633) actually it is also another custom plus so i need to use

- [01:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=6635) so i need to use raw

- [01:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=6636) raw okay hey it will be equal to 100 px

- [01:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=6645) okay and when i now refresh my page

- [01:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=6648) and when i now refresh my page okay it didn't work as that so let's see

- [01:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=6651) okay it didn't work as that so let's see what is wrong

- [01:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=6657) maybe like this yeah not working

- [01:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=6659) yeah not working so you see

- [01:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=6660) so you see each one is set as 100 pixel row size

- [01:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=6664) each one is set as 100 pixel row size um the first one is justify content

- [01:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=6667) um the first one is justify content start let's also

- [01:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=6669) start let's also type them here

- [01:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=6686) and they are centered you see like here and we have just the content and i think

- [01:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=6688) and we have just the content and i think this will write

- [01:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=6689) this will write a line down

- [01:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=6691) a line down like in microsoft

- [01:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=6693) like in microsoft like here

- [01:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=6694) like here then we have justify contact around so

- [01:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=6696) then we have justify contact around so around means

- [01:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=6698) around means they will get i think equal

- [01:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=6705) no uh yeah equal let me show you that

- [01:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=6708) let me show you that okay with the print screen

- [01:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=6714) and here okay and see

- [01:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=6715) okay and see so this is about

- [01:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=6717) so this is about let's

- [01:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=6718) let's change this

- [01:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=6720) change this okay um

- [01:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=6723) okay um 137 pixels i think this will be double

- [01:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=6725) 137 pixels i think this will be double side of it

- [01:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=6727) side of it yeah

- [01:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=6729) yeah 273 and this will be equal to the first

- [01:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=6732) 273 and this will be equal to the first one

- [01:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=6733) one yeah

- [01:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=6734) yeah so it is like this let me

- [01:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=6736) so it is like this let me uh type it here

- [01:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=6738) uh type it here so this is um

- [01:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=6745) okay this is two x this is one x and this is one x

- [01:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=6752) okay and then we have uh justify content between

- [01:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=6758) so these left and right align them like here

- [01:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=6759) here and we have just like content evenly i

- [01:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=6762) and we have just like content evenly i think this will be one x one x one x

- [01:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=6766) think this will be one x one x one x yeah one x here one x here and one x

- [01:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=6769) yeah one x here one x here and one x here

- [01:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=6771) here okay uh we have seen each one of them

- [01:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=6783) all right so let's continue with

- [01:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=6785) so let's continue with uh column wrapping

- [01:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=6792) column wrapping if more than 12 columns are placed

- [01:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=6794) if more than 12 columns are placed within a single row each group of extra

- [01:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=6796) within a single row each group of extra columns will as one unit wrap onto a new

- [01:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=6799) columns will as one unit wrap onto a new line

- [01:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=6801) line yeah this is already the behavior that

- [01:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=6803) yeah this is already the behavior that we are uh

- [01:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=6812) let's see it

- [01:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=6818) so within a container actually within a row that can be only

- [01:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=6820) actually within a row that can be only up to 12 column and the more of the

- [01:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=6823) up to 12 column and the more of the columns will be

- [01:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=6825) columns will be wrapped into a new line so there is 9 4

- [01:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=6828) wrapped into a new line so there is 9 4 6 which means

- [01:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=6829) 6 which means 13 plus

- [01:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=6831) 13 plus 6 it is 18.

- [01:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=6834) 6 it is 18. however

- [01:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=6835) however the total of these two is

- [01:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=6838) the total of these two is overflowing 12. so let's see how it

- [01:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=6841) overflowing 12. so let's see how it behaves

- [01:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=6849) okay this is nine coulomb and you see uh this is four column however since

- [01:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=6851) this is four column however since nine plus four is over twelve this is

- [01:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=6855) nine plus four is over twelve this is getting to the uh

- [01:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=6857) getting to the uh next row like here

- [01:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=6859) next row like here and this is also there

- [01:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=6861) and this is also there other one

- [01:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=6863) other one so this is column wrapping and when we

- [01:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=6866) so this is column wrapping and when we make it smaller the behavior doesn't

- [01:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=6868) make it smaller the behavior doesn't change

- [01:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=6874) okay and by default they are wrapping you

- [01:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=6876) and by default they are wrapping you don't need to define any other

- [01:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=6879) don't need to define any other class or anything

- [01:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=6885) column breaks column breaks

- [01:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=6887) column breaks breaking columns to a new line in

- [01:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=6889) breaking columns to a new line in flexbox requires a small hack add an

- [01:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=6892) flexbox requires a small hack add an element with width 100 wherever you want

- [01:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=6895) element with width 100 wherever you want to wrap your columns to a new line

- [01:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=6897) to wrap your columns to a new line normally this is accomplished with

- [01:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=6899) normally this is accomplished with multiple dot rows but not every

- [01:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=6901) multiple dot rows but not every implementation method can account for

- [01:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=6903) implementation method can account for this

- [01:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=6904) this okay so there are six columns and four

- [01:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=6908) okay so there are six columns and four small medium small size

- [01:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=6911) small medium small size three columns

- [01:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=6914) three columns oh i see force next columns to break

- [01:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=6916) oh i see force next columns to break with a new line so this is a

- [01:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=6919) with a new line so this is a hacking that we make

- [01:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=6935) cause a brake line um

- [01:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=6936) um [Music]

- [01:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=6938) [Music] okay here we see

- [01:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=6941) okay here we see normally this should take half of uh

- [01:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=6943) normally this should take half of uh yeah 25 percent of the species they are

- [01:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=6946) yeah 25 percent of the species they are taking however

- [01:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=6948) taking however here we are seeing a break

- [01:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=6951) here we are seeing a break and it forces this bottom to go to the

- [01:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=6954) and it forces this bottom to go to the next line

- [01:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=6955) next line without it uh

- [01:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=6957) without it uh let me show you

- [01:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=6959) let me show you they would be visible in

- [01:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=6966) a single row like this

- [01:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=6967) like this but with this

- [01:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=6969) but with this they are being forced into new line

- [01:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=6972) they are being forced into new line um by the way but secret size is smaller

- [01:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=6977) um by the way but secret size is smaller like this yeah

- [01:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7001) so display property we have the value okay

- [01:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7003) okay the breakpoint volume

- [01:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7019) oh so this means this is display inline display is a

- [01:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7021) display is a property of

- [01:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7023) property of html

- [01:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7024) html so it supports display non-display non

- [01:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7027) so it supports display non-display non dcm block

- [01:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7030) dcm block so

- [01:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7031) so you see you can set display now for 30

- [01:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7034) you see you can set display now for 30 and screen size

- [01:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7035) and screen size you see like hidden only on x6 large

- [01:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7039) you see like hidden only on x6 large um

- [01:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7040) um so we can make this

- [01:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7042) so we can make this as like this

- [01:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7046) as like this so then it is um

- [01:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7055) so this will be displayed none in xx large

- [01:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7056) large we won't see it however when the

- [01:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7058) we won't see it however when the sequence size gets

- [01:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7060) sequence size gets smaller than xx slash it will become

- [01:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7062) smaller than xx slash it will become visible yeah it is working great

- [01:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7064) visible yeah it is working great so this is the display property

- [01:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7067) so this is the display property there is display none inline in line

- [01:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7069) there is display none inline in line block block creates table cell table

- [01:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7071) block block creates table cell table draw flexi

- [01:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7073) draw flexi and in line flex and what is this p

- [01:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7083) how do we see i think it is at the bottom

- [01:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7084) bottom okay let's continue so this means this

- [01:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7087) okay let's continue so this means this will be display block when

- [01:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7090) will be display block when uh

- [01:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7090) uh it is medium-sized screen

- [01:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7099) and otherwise it will be display now so by default this won't be visible and

- [01:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7101) by default this won't be visible and this will become visible after screen is

- [01:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7105) this will become visible after screen is uh

- [01:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7105) uh smaller than medium

- [01:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7115) actually let's see i mean if this screen is bigger than

- [01:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7117) i mean if this screen is bigger than medium it will be display block if

- [01:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7120) medium it will be display block if smaller than medium it will become

- [01:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7121) smaller than medium it will become display none

- [01:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7124) display none so

- [01:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7125) so when we get below medium

- [01:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7129) when we get below medium yeah it becomes display none as you see

- [01:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7141) reordering order classes

- [01:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7143) order classes use dot order classes for controlling

- [01:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7145) use dot order classes for controlling the visual order of your content

- [01:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7148) the visual order of your content these classes are responsive so you can

- [01:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7150) these classes are responsive so you can set the order by breakpoint

- [01:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7152) set the order by breakpoint example.order1.ordermd2

- [01:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7157) includes support for one through five across all six grid tiers

- [01:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7160) across all six grid tiers so it supports one to five

- [01:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7167) let's test it as well this is making your code much more uh

- [01:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7171) this is making your code much more uh organized

- [01:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7172) organized easier to uh

- [01:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7174) easier to uh write

- [01:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7176) write so

- [01:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7177) so first term no order applied so second

- [01:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7179) first term no order applied so second term with larger order and thirteen with

- [01:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7182) term with larger order and thirteen with order of one

- [01:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7183) order of one so let's see the difference

- [01:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7186) so let's see the difference first on third term second term

- [01:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7189) first on third term second term [Music]

- [01:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7190) [Music] so you see the third tone becomes

- [01:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7193) so you see the third tone becomes upper than this one because it has order

- [01:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7196) upper than this one because it has order one

- [02:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7202) okay if i make this order two then uh the first one will become this

- [02:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7205) then uh the first one will become this one

- [02:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7206) one let me show you that

- [02:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7208) let me show you that yeah

- [02:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7209) yeah you see so they are so being sorted uh

- [02:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7212) you see so they are so being sorted uh with this order talk it is extremely

- [02:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7215) with this order talk it is extremely useful if you ask me

- [02:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7218) useful if you ask me there are also responsible order first

- [02:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7220) there are also responsible order first order laws oh nice

- [02:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7223) order laws oh nice actually i haven't used a bootstrap in

- [02:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7226) actually i haven't used a bootstrap in none of my

- [02:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7228) none of my real projects so far because when i

- [02:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7230) real projects so far because when i first started

- [02:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7232) first started we didn't know any of this it was also

- [02:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7234) we didn't know any of this it was also in 2009

- [02:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7236) in 2009 what when was the first version of

- [02:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7239) what when was the first version of first stop

- [02:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7241) first stop in my university none of these were

- [02:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7245) in my university none of these were shown to us so the first one was in yeah

- [02:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7249) shown to us so the first one was in yeah 2011.

- [02:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7254) okay so when we refresh you see this is

- [02:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7256) so when we refresh you see this is ordered first unordered and ordered last

- [02:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7260) ordered first unordered and ordered last then there is offsetting columns

- [02:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7263) then there is offsetting columns offsetting columns

- [02:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7265) offsetting columns you can offset grid columns in two ways

- [02:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7268) you can offset grid columns in two ways our responsive dot offset grid classes

- [02:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7270) our responsive dot offset grid classes and our margin utilities

- [02:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7273) and our margin utilities grid classes are sized to match columns

- [02:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7275) grid classes are sized to match columns while margins are more useful for quick

- [02:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7277) while margins are more useful for quick layouts where the width of the offset is

- [02:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7279) layouts where the width of the offset is variable

- [02:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7280) variable offset classes

- [02:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7283) offset classes move columns to the right using dot

- [02:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7285) move columns to the right using dot offset md-asterisk classes so md means

- [02:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7288) offset md-asterisk classes so md means it will work only if the screen size is

- [02:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7291) it will work only if the screen size is bigger or equal to medium size you

- [02:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7293) bigger or equal to medium size you already should know that nd dash

- [02:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7297) already should know that nd dash asterisk classes

- [02:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7299) asterisk classes these classes increase the left margin

- [02:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7301) these classes increase the left margin of a column by asterisk columns

- [02:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7303) of a column by asterisk columns for example dot offset nd for moves.call

- [02:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7307) for example dot offset nd for moves.call md for over four columns

- [02:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7309) md for over four columns yeah let's see this by the way this will

- [02:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7311) yeah let's see this by the way this will work only if the screen size is bigger

- [02:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7313) work only if the screen size is bigger than medium

- [02:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7321) okay okay

- [02:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7322) okay so here

- [02:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7323) so here uh this is a regular column and here we

- [02:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7325) uh this is a regular column and here we have four offsets so this will at the

- [02:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7328) have four offsets so this will at the end of the

- [02:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7329) end of the screen i am going to make this three

- [02:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7331) screen i am going to make this three offset

- [02:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7333) offset like

- [02:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7340) this okay so there will be still one uh column at the right you see like this so

- [02:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7341) column at the right you see like this so one column here

- [02:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7343) one column here uh there are three column offset here

- [02:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7345) uh there are three column offset here and this is taking four column size yeah

- [02:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7349) and this is taking four column size yeah it is working as

- [02:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7351) it is working as we would have expect

- [02:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7358) and they are also responsive so you can set different

- [02:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7360) responsive so you can set different offsets for different

- [02:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7362) offsets for different uh screen dimensions

- [02:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7365) uh screen dimensions then there's margin utilities

- [02:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7371) so margin auto margin auto means that it will set

- [02:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7374) margin auto means that it will set margin automatically i think it will set

- [02:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7376) margin automatically i think it will set as centered off

- [02:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7379) as centered off let's see

- [02:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7380) let's see [Music]

- [02:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7390) okay so margin auto is sent to the end

- [02:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7392) sent to the end interesting why

- [02:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7394) interesting why and that is margin auto

- [02:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7402) [Music] here

- [02:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7404) here so when they are both margin also this

- [02:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7406) so when they are both margin also this one is set like this okay one uh empty

- [02:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7410) one is set like this okay one uh empty one one empty one like this

- [02:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7415) one one empty one like this and

- [02:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7416) and there is column auto

- [02:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7419) there is column auto so column auto means it will take

- [02:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7422) so column auto means it will take necessary space i think

- [02:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7425) necessary space i think like here

- [02:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7427) like here and

- [02:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7428) and this will also set

- [02:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7441) with move to the flexbox in version 4 you can use module just like me a auto

- [02:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7443) you can use module just like me a auto for sibling codes away from one another

- [02:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7446) for sibling codes away from one another [Music]

- [02:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7448) [Music] so ms auto and there is me a author

- [02:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7452) so ms auto and there is me a author then there's sent along column classes

- [02:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7454) then there's sent along column classes stand alone column classes

- [02:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7457) stand alone column classes the dot call dash asterisk classes can

- [02:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7459) the dot call dash asterisk classes can also be used outside a dot row to give

- [02:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7461) also be used outside a dot row to give an element a specific width whenever

- [02:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7464) an element a specific width whenever column classes are used as non-direct

- [02:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7466) column classes are used as non-direct children of a row the paddings are

- [02:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7468) children of a row the paddings are omitted

- [02:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7470) omitted okay so these are individual classes

- [02:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7474) okay so these are individual classes which are not under any container and

- [02:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7478) which are not under any container and you see it has set borders so we can see

- [02:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7486) okay so they are taking like this and they are not

- [02:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7489) they are not they don't have heading from laptop you

- [02:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7492) they don't have heading from laptop you see

- [02:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7493) see column width column width above s and

- [02:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7495) column width column width above s and breakpoints

- [02:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7498) breakpoints when we get smaller they become like

- [02:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7500) when we get smaller they become like this here

- [02:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7507) so bg light means it has background and p3 what is this p3

- [02:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7511) and p3 what is this p3 this may be the

- [02:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7514) this may be the column size

- [02:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7527) paragraph oh but what does p3 means

- [02:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7535) oh p is padding i see so p3 means it will have

- [02:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7539) so p3 means it will have uh how much

- [02:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7548) space is important so it will be pixel-sized spacers

- [02:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7551) so it will be pixel-sized spacers probably

- [02:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7552) probably let's see how it is

- [02:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7554) let's see how it is displayed in the browser

- [02:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7557) displayed in the browser as a heading

- [02:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7579) oh so it is one ram it is not pixel sized

- [02:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7582) it is not pixel sized if you make it two ram it comes like

- [02:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7584) if you make it two ram it comes like this

- [02:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7585) this so how much pixel is one of them

- [02:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7588) so how much pixel is one of them how many pixels

- [02:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7597) okay so one of them is uh 16 pixels in most of the browsers

- [02:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7601) okay and

- [02:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7604) and let's read it

- [02:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7609) the classes can be used together with utilities to create responsive floated

- [02:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7611) utilities to create responsive floated images

- [02:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7613) images make sure to wrap the content in a dot

- [02:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7615) make sure to wrap the content in a dot clear fix wrapper to clear the float if

- [02:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7617) clear fix wrapper to clear the float if the text is shorter

- [02:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7624) a paragraph of placeholder text we're using it here to show the use of

- [02:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7625) we're using it here to show the use of the clear fix class

- [02:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7627) the clear fix class we're adding quite a few meaningless

- [02:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7629) we're adding quite a few meaningless phrases here to demonstrate how the

- [02:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7631) phrases here to demonstrate how the columns interact here with the floated

- [02:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7632) columns interact here with the floated image

- [02:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7634) image as you can see the paragraphs gracefully

- [02:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7636) as you can see the paragraphs gracefully wrap around the floated image

- [02:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7639) wrap around the floated image now imagine how this would look with

- [02:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7641) now imagine how this would look with some actual content in here rather than

- [02:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7643) some actual content in here rather than just this boring placeholder text that

- [02:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7645) just this boring placeholder text that goes on and on but actually conveys no

- [02:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7647) goes on and on but actually conveys no tangible information at

- [02:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7649) tangible information at it simply takes up space and should not

- [02:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7652) it simply takes up space and should not really be read

- [02:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7654) really be read and yet here you are still persevering

- [02:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7656) and yet here you are still persevering and reading this placeholder text hoping

- [02:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7658) and reading this placeholder text hoping for some more insights or some hidden

- [02:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7661) for some more insights or some hidden okay so let's see how it works

- [02:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7677) okay so we have an image here uh which has

- [02:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7679) uh which has a hidden

- [02:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7682) a hidden src so let's get the

- [02:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7685) src so let's get the image from somewhere else

- [02:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7697) okay i will get some image of our school yeah for example

- [02:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7706) here and then

- [02:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7708) and then okay so this has six column size in

- [02:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7711) okay so this has six column size in medium or bigger

- [02:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7713) medium or bigger plot md to end so it will be

- [02:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7717) plot md to end so it will be and loaded

- [02:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7718) and loaded it has mb3

- [02:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7721) it has mb3 msmb3 so mb is

- [02:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7725) msmb3 so mb is what is mb

- [02:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7739) so m is for cluster set margin b is margin bottom yeah

- [02:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7741) margin bottom yeah so margin bottom three three means three

- [02:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7744) so margin bottom three three means three grams probably uh 48 pixels

- [02:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7747) grams probably uh 48 pixels and this is mc so mc is

- [02:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7756) margin size probably

- [02:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7758) probably three

- [02:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7759) three and when we refresh our page

- [02:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7766) okay we are able to see the image like this however

- [02:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7769) this however um

- [02:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7771) um image is becoming

- [02:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7774) image is becoming bigger not the original size

- [02:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7777) bigger not the original size so how can we fix that

- [02:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7786) so the clear fix is making it like this and when i make it smaller it becomes

- [02:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7788) and when i make it smaller it becomes like this when it gets smaller than

- [02:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7790) like this when it gets smaller than medium size

- [02:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7796) okay so why this image is getting bigger size

- [02:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7802) so it says margin left right margin bottom

- [02:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7904) well what happens when we add image fleet

- [02:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7921) okay now it is original size so

- [02:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7927) make it good and

- [02:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7933) okay now you see we didn't set column size therefore it is not taking entire

- [02:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7936) size therefore it is not taking entire space

- [02:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7937) space and it is floated to right however it

- [02:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7940) and it is floated to right however it becomes get it gets to the top

- [02:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7944) becomes get it gets to the top and to prevent it i need to make this as

- [02:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7947) and to prevent it i need to make this as sm

- [02:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7950) sm so it won't get to the top until the

- [02:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7953) so it won't get to the top until the very small dimension

- [02:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7962) and this uses clear clicks what happens if we use container instead of clear fix

- [02:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7975) yeah i think this is better it also has a border

- [02:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7977) a border where does this border coming from it's

- [02:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7979) where does this border coming from it's coming from our border class yeah

- [02:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7982) coming from our border class yeah and there are some paragraphs

- [02:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7985) and there are some paragraphs so paragraphs are like this you know

- [02:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7987) so paragraphs are like this you know achieving this

- [02:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7989) achieving this uh with regular html is extremely hard

- [02:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7993) uh with regular html is extremely hard however with bootstrap it is pretty easy

- [02:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7997) however with bootstrap it is pretty easy we can also set this as i think let's

- [02:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=7999) we can also set this as i think let's see

- [02:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=8000) see [Music]

- [02:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=8005) maybe centers or justify content

- [02:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=8015) okay andy around omniscient

- [02:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=8039) so select align items [Music]

- [02:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=8042) [Music] align

- [02:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=8043) align content center

- [02:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=8046) content center let's see

- [02:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=8066) answers no not working

- [02:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=8109) okay so there is justified content centers

- [02:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=8111) centers maybe

- [02:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=8119) okay let's point from our example so justify

- [02:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=8122) point from our example so justify content and this is not we are looking

- [02:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=8124) content and this is not we are looking for what we are looking for is this one

- [02:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=8128) for what we are looking for is this one so this one is

- [02:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=8141) so this image is not currently align center

- [02:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=8155) okay now i think it is no still not a nice item center

- [02:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=8158) nice item center xp removed is what happens

- [02:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=8231) we should use a mix also let's try a mix ultra

- [02:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=8267) okay uh this is posted but they didn't show example of

- [02:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=8270) posted but they didn't show example of how to center this image

- [02:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=8278) i think we can achieve that with rows and

- [02:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=8280) rows and uh columns

- [02:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=8282) uh columns yeah maybe let's make that as that way

- [02:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=8284) yeah maybe let's make that as that way so we will uh

- [02:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=8286) so we will uh see

- [02:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=8287) see it's also a good practice for us

- [02:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=8290) it's also a good practice for us i will leave this and this is and i will

- [02:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=8293) i will leave this and this is and i will copy paste it

- [02:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=8298) okay so let's copy and paste

- [02:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=8301) so let's copy and paste okay so we have a

- [02:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=8303) okay so we have a container then we are going to have a

- [02:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=8305) container then we are going to have a row

- [02:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=8315) okay then we are going to have two columns okay

- [02:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=8318) two columns okay um

- [02:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=8329) i will make it column six so they will be equal size or let's

- [02:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=8331) be equal size or let's set it as auto

- [02:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=8334) set it as auto so this will be first column

- [02:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=8337) so this will be first column and then we're going to have second

- [02:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=8339) and then we're going to have second column

- [02:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=8346) okay let's see how it looks uh so far

- [02:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=8353) okay it is being like this currently uh

- [02:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=8354) uh so when we make it column six and

- [02:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=8357) so when we make it column six and that way it is not working as we wanted

- [02:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=8361) that way it is not working as we wanted so let's say

- [02:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=8370) not column autobots column six yeah so they will be equal

- [02:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=8381) okay we will get this bottom

- [02:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=8383) we will get this bottom here

- [02:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=8385) here then

- [02:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=8385) then we will add display

- [02:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=8389) we will add display okay items

- [02:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=8391) okay items align items

- [02:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=8392) align items center

- [02:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=8394) center for image

- [02:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=8406) align content sensor

- [02:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=8421) yeah okay so our division is correct but align content center is not working

- [02:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=8424) but align content center is not working so far

- [02:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=8461) maybe it is justified content it will work

- [02:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=8469) no just the content is not we are looking for

- [02:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=8472) looking for what we are looking for is

- [02:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=8474) what we are looking for is rather than this

- [02:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=8502) okay so this is my okay for bootstrap for there is a mx auto

- [02:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=8504) for there is a mx auto we are using bootstrap 5

- [02:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=8507) we are using bootstrap 5 so it should work

- [02:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=8519) so this will be the class oh i see this will be the class of

- [02:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=8521) will be the class of our example

- [02:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=8531) okay so it is uh centered but not vertically so i learn content center

- [02:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=8534) vertically so i learn content center aligns

- [02:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=8546) and what happens when i remove this class

- [02:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=8566) maybe justify content centering why what is the difference these two

- [02:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=8568) is the difference these two three i wonder

- [02:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=8570) three i wonder let's remove it and see

- [02:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=8605) okay what we need to achieve is we need to

- [02:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=8609) vertically and horizontally center it

- [02:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=8612) and horizontally center it okay so it has deflects align item

- [02:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=8615) okay so it has deflects align item center justify content centers

- [02:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=8618) center justify content centers and we have column

- [02:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=8623) so align

- [02:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=8624) align content

- [02:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=8627) content and let's see it is working

- [02:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=8629) and let's see it is working yeah

- [02:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=8630) yeah you see uh so we need to use d flex

- [02:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=8633) you see uh so we need to use d flex otherwise it won't work let me show you

- [02:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=8637) otherwise it won't work let me show you yeah

- [02:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=8638) yeah so d flex is a key

- [02:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=8641) so d flex is a key what is d flex

- [02:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=8643) what is d flex d flex is display flex so this class

- [02:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=8646) d flex is display flex so this class becomes

- [02:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=8647) becomes display flex and

- [02:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=8650) display flex and when it becomes a flex box

- [02:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=8653) when it becomes a flex box you see now image can be centered like

- [02:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=8655) you see now image can be centered like this

- [02:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=8657) this i can now set its position as i want

- [02:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=8660) i can now set its position as i want for example i can remove this column

- [02:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=8662) for example i can remove this column count

- [02:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=8664) count just make it column

- [02:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=8666) just make it column and just make this column as well

- [02:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=8678) they are still equal so we can make this as nine column

- [02:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=8681) so we can make this as nine column this one has three column

- [02:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=8689) yeah then we can set this to the right or

- [02:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=8692) then we can set this to the right or left so

- [02:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=8693) left so i think

- [02:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=8696) i think it is align items left

- [02:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=8702) no no this one

- [02:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=8705) no this one just file content left

- [02:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=8707) just file content left yeah so we just justify content set its

- [02:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=8711) yeah so we just justify content set its uh

- [02:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=8713) uh horizontally

- [02:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=8715) horizontally and align item set it vertically

- [02:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=8725) if i understand correctly versus so what is the difference one is that

- [02:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=8727) so what is the difference one is that vertically one is that horizontally i

- [02:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=8729) vertically one is that horizontally i think

- [02:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=8730) think along primary axis

- [02:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=8733) along primary axis just for content yeah secondary axis

- [02:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=8736) just for content yeah secondary axis so it says this is horizontally left and

- [02:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=8738) so it says this is horizontally left and this is vertically top yeah

- [02:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=8742) this is vertically top yeah okay uh let's set it as right

- [02:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=8752) and now it is working exactly as you want oh it didn't work why

- [02:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=8772) no wait

- [02:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=8774) wait maybe we need to set it as and not left

- [02:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=8777) maybe we need to set it as and not left or right here

- [02:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=8779) or right here it it takes start

- [02:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=8781) it it takes start or and beginning of and not left or

- [02:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=8784) or and beginning of and not left or right

- [02:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=8786) right so let's refresh yeah now working okay

- [02:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=8791) so let's refresh yeah now working okay okay uh before moving next

- [02:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=8819) breakpoints variable breakpoints

- [02:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=8831) okay and containers

- [02:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=8846) okay default containers

- [02:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=8875) okay let's move to the grid uh what is the grid system

- [02:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=8886) five okay

- [02:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=8888) okay how this works

- [02:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=8905) okay grid options

- [02:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=8963) five okay [Music]

- [02:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=8965) [Music] and vadas then columns

- [02:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=8981) okay uh columns vertical alignment

- [02:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=8985) columns vertical alignment vertical alignment

- [02:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=8991) you see these are the primary alignment things

- [02:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=8992) things and once you master this you then you

- [02:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=8994) and once you master this you then you can

- [02:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=8996) can build your website

- [02:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=8999) build your website as you want easily

- [02:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9001) as you want easily put position elements as you want easily

- [02:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9005) put position elements as you want easily column breaks so these are the primary

- [02:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9007) column breaks so these are the primary things that you need to master

- [02:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9009) things that you need to master and you will be able to master them as

- [02:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9012) and you will be able to master them as you work on them as you make examples

- [02:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9015) you work on them as you make examples and then

- [02:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9016) and then on them and

- [02:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9018) on them and as you search for solutions

- [02:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9030) and you will also get used to this wording

- [02:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9031) wording such as merging utilities padding

- [02:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9035) such as merging utilities padding okay some local classes

- [02:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9049) okay now we can move to the next which is

- [02:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9051) is gutters

- [02:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9058) okay gutters are the padding between your

- [02:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9060) gutters are the padding between your columns used to responsively space and

- [02:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9062) columns used to responsively space and align content in the bootstrap grid

- [02:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9064) align content in the bootstrap grid system

- [02:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9066) system on this page

- [02:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9068) on this page okay so it is used to uh it is used for

- [02:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9071) okay so it is used to uh it is used for padding between columns

- [02:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9073) padding between columns how they work

- [02:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9079) gutters are the gaps between column content created by horizontal padding

- [02:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9082) content created by horizontal padding we set padding right and padding left on

- [02:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9084) we set padding right and padding left on each column and use negative margin to

- [02:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9086) each column and use negative margin to offset that at the start and end of each

- [02:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9088) offset that at the start and end of each row to align content

- [02:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9091) row to align content gutters start at 1.5 rem 24 px wide so 1

- [02:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9096) gutters start at 1.5 rem 24 px wide so 1 rm is

- [02:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9098) rm is 16 pixel

- [02:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9100) 16 pixel px

- [02:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9101) px this allows us to match our grid to the

- [02:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9103) this allows us to match our grid to the padding in margin spacer scale

- [02:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9106) padding in margin spacer scale gutters can be responsively adjusted

- [02:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9109) gutters can be responsively adjusted use breakpoint specific gutter classes

- [02:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9111) use breakpoint specific gutter classes to modify horizontal gutters vertical

- [02:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9113) to modify horizontal gutters vertical gutters and all gutters okay

- [02:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9121) horizontal gutters dot gx-asterisk classes can be used to

- [02:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9124) dot gx-asterisk classes can be used to control the horizontal gutter widths

- [02:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9126) control the horizontal gutter widths the dot container or dot container fluid

- [02:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9129) the dot container or dot container fluid parent may need to be adjusted if larger

- [02:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9131) parent may need to be adjusted if larger gutters are used to to avoid unwanted

- [02:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9133) gutters are used to to avoid unwanted overflow using a matching padding

- [02:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9135) overflow using a matching padding utility

- [02:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9136) utility for example in the following example

- [02:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9138) for example in the following example we've increased the padding with dot px4

- [02:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9142) we've increased the padding with dot px4 okay so let's test this

- [02:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9151) okay here we have container and px is 4

- [02:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9155) we have container and px is 4 which means i think it is

- [02:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9161) a gutter size

- [02:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9166) and then we have p3 uh it is also padding

- [02:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9169) uh it is also padding so let's refresh our page to see

- [02:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9177) and let's also add some new line

- [02:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9186) okay so we have some custom column padding

- [02:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9192) and inside padding so our padding here is

- [02:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9196) so our padding here is 3 ram

- [02:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9199) 3 ram like this

- [02:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9201) like this it is for the 8 pixel but i don't see

- [02:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9203) it is for the 8 pixel but i don't see that many pixels here maybe it is that

- [02:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9206) that many pixels here maybe it is that and then we have a

- [02:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9209) and then we have a padding between columns and

- [02:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9213) padding between columns and let's see that's

- [02:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9216) let's see that's here

- [02:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9218) here so we have bought inside

- [02:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9220) so we have bought inside padding and

- [02:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9222) padding and [Music]

- [02:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9225) [Music] outside of the division padding

- [02:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9229) outside of the division padding okay so inside division padding is 1 ram

- [02:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9233) okay so inside division padding is 1 ram and here

- [02:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9235) and here it is p3

- [02:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9240) so how much is p2 let's see

- [02:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9242) let's see p2 is

- [02:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9254) okay p2 is uh 0.5

- [02:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9255) 0.5 um

- [02:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9256) um so

- [02:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9257) so p3 is 16 pixel p2 is

- [02:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9260) p3 is 16 pixel p2 is 8 pixel and

- [02:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9267) this is not exactly

- [02:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9272) that's many so

- [02:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9273) so we have two divisions and

- [02:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9279) they have let's see

- [02:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9300) okay so it is calculated like this i think

- [02:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9307) okay so this uses px4 and

- [02:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9311) this uses px4 and there's gx5

- [02:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9314) there's gx5 so what does each

- [02:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9315) so what does each one meaning is

- [02:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9333) [Music] you see you getting used to this uh

- [02:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9337) you see you getting used to this uh notation will take some time

- [02:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9354) okay so p is padding and x is left and right here

- [02:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9355) right here so px means it is setting for both left

- [02:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9358) so px means it is setting for both left and right

- [02:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9360) and right p set for all kind of

- [02:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9362) p set for all kind of old

- [02:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9364) old dimension padding

- [02:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9367) dimension padding dx is also same

- [02:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9370) dx is also same it takes the same okay

- [02:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9372) it takes the same okay one moment

- [02:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9377) okay so p x means it will be left and right

- [02:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9380) so p x means it will be left and right and gx means it will be left and right

- [02:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9384) and gx means it will be left and right okay so this is how you set uh padding

- [02:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9387) okay so this is how you set uh padding between your uh

- [02:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9390) between your uh columns

- [02:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9391) columns uh let's change this to something like

- [02:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9393) uh let's change this to something like this so it will be more visible

- [02:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9397) this so it will be more visible i will make it auto so it will be

- [02:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9399) i will make it auto so it will be automatically set

- [02:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9402) automatically set according to the inside

- [02:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9405) according to the inside content

- [02:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9407) content size you see padding is now much more

- [02:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9410) size you see padding is now much more visible like this

- [02:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9413) visible like this okay um

- [02:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9414) okay um [Music]

- [02:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9421) so this is gathers and then you can set container overflow hidden so this is

- [02:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9424) container overflow hidden so this is also another class

- [02:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9426) also another class and when it is overflow hidden let's see

- [02:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9429) and when it is overflow hidden let's see what kind of difference it makes

- [02:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9444) okay custom custom padding and let's increase the size of content

- [02:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9455) okay so it is becoming like this nothing fancy and

- [02:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9458) fancy and what difference this make

- [02:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9464) i don't see any difference so why

- [02:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9475) [Music] then you can have vertical uh

- [02:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9477) then you can have vertical uh gather like this

- [02:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9485) [Music] and you can use overflow hidden to

- [02:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9487) and you can use overflow hidden to prevent you see

- [02:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9488) prevent you see [Music]

- [02:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9494) row at the end of page overflow

- [02:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9496) overflow so when you use goddess you should use

- [02:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9498) so when you use goddess you should use for about the overflow hidden

- [02:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9508) okay so this is vertical gather and

- [02:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9515) you see we can add margin bottom how do we do that okay like this and

- [02:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9517) how do we do that okay like this and when i add margin bottom

- [02:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9519) when i add margin bottom they won't be you see they are currently

- [02:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9521) they won't be you see they are currently conflicting

- [02:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9523) conflicting and when i add margin button you see now

- [02:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9525) and when i add margin button you see now it is working

- [02:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9527) it is working i can set it as 3 which would may which

- [02:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9530) i can set it as 3 which would may which would be 16 pixels i believe yeah

- [02:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9534) would be 16 pixels i believe yeah okay

- [02:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9535) okay horizontal vertical gutters you can use

- [02:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9537) horizontal vertical gutters you can use them at the same time like this as well

- [02:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9541) them at the same time like this as well yeah let's try this

- [02:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9548) so i will add g5 yeah so this will be each

- [02:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9551) yeah so this will be each size cutters

- [02:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9568) and then you can have row column gutters like here row column two row column lg5

- [02:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9572) like here row column two row column lg5 g2 glg3 yeah so it will be by default

- [02:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9576) g2 glg3 yeah so it will be by default too and if the degree is

- [02:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9579) too and if the degree is bigger than large then it will be 3.

- [02:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9586) okay so it also supports responsive design as well

- [02:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9597) achieve responsive design no matter what screen you are using

- [02:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9599) screen you are using and when we change size uh the gather

- [02:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9603) and when we change size uh the gather will

- [02:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9604) will get reduced

- [02:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9607) get reduced okay like this

- [02:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9622) no gutters the gutters between columns and our

- [02:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9623) the gutters between columns and our predefined grid classes can be removed

- [02:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9625) predefined grid classes can be removed with dot g0

- [02:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9627) with dot g0 this removes the negative margins from

- [02:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9629) this removes the negative margins from dot row and the horizontal padding from

- [02:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9632) dot row and the horizontal padding from all immediate children columns

- [02:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9635) all immediate children columns okay so

- [02:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9637) okay so do we have gathered currently

- [02:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9639) do we have gathered currently no we don't have

- [02:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9641) no we don't have in the previous examples

- [02:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9647) columns need an edge to edge design

- [02:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9649) need an edge to edge design drop the parent dot container or dot

- [02:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9652) drop the parent dot container or dot container fluid

- [02:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9654) container fluid in practice here's how it looks

- [02:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9656) in practice here's how it looks note you can continue to use this with

- [02:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9658) note you can continue to use this with all other predefined grid classes

- [02:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9660) all other predefined grid classes including column widths responsive tiers

- [02:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9663) including column widths responsive tiers reorders and more

- [02:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9665) reorders and more so here zero gathers and we don't have a

- [02:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9668) so here zero gathers and we don't have a parent container it is just a row and

- [02:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9673) parent container it is just a row and a

- [02:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9674) a column so it will be

- [02:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9677) column so it will be displayed like this let me show you

- [02:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9688) okay it will stop start at the left top it will take entire space no painting

- [02:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9691) it will take entire space no painting from right or left

- [02:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9693) from right or left and it's it is here

- [02:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9699) um okay

- [02:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9755) utilities for layout for faster mobile friendly and

- [02:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9756) for faster mobile friendly and responsive development bootstrap

- [02:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9762) showing hiding aligning and spacing content

- [02:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9764) content on this page

- [02:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9769) okay changing display

- [02:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9771) changing display use our display utilities for

- [02:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9773) use our display utilities for responsibly toggling common values of

- [02:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9775) responsibly toggling common values of the display property

- [02:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9777) the display property mix it with our grid system content or

- [02:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9779) mix it with our grid system content or components to show or hide them across

- [02:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9781) components to show or hide them across specific viewports

- [02:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9784) specific viewports flexbox options

- [02:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9786) flexbox options bootstrap is built with flexbox but not

- [02:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9789) bootstrap is built with flexbox but not every element's display has been changed

- [02:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9791) every element's display has been changed to display flex as this would add many

- [02:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9793) to display flex as this would add many unnecessary overrides and unexpectedly

- [02:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9795) unnecessary overrides and unexpectedly change key browser behaviors

- [02:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9798) change key browser behaviors most of our components are built with

- [02:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9800) most of our components are built with flexbox enabled

- [02:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9802) flexbox enabled should you need to add display flex to

- [02:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9804) should you need to add display flex to an element do so with dot d flex or one

- [02:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9807) an element do so with dot d flex or one of the responsive variants example dot

- [02:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9809) of the responsive variants example dot dsm flex so what is the difference

- [02:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9811) dsm flex so what is the difference between d flex and dsm flex it is only

- [02:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9814) between d flex and dsm flex it is only that if the screen size is bigger than

- [02:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9817) that if the screen size is bigger than small

- [02:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9818) small or equal it will become enabled

- [02:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9820) or equal it will become enabled otherwise it won't be in the very small

- [02:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9822) otherwise it won't be in the very small screens and this will be by default

- [02:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9824) screens and this will be by default enabled everywhere so this sm is meaning

- [02:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9827) enabled everywhere so this sm is meaning it is a breakpoint

- [02:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9829) it is a breakpoint by now you should be already understood

- [02:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9831) by now you should be already understood that

- [02:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9832) that you'll need this class or display value

- [02:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9834) you'll need this class or display value to allow the use of our extra flexbox

- [02:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9873) one rem and ltr starting at the nd break point

- [02:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9874) point and then there's the total visibility i

- [02:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9876) and then there's the total visibility i think we will see them

- [02:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9879) think we will see them in utility

- [02:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9881) in utility classes at the bottom so let's just

- [02:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9883) classes at the bottom so let's just continue

- [02:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9886) continue okay

- [02:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9887) okay and z index

- [02:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9895) z index while not a part of bootstrap's grid

- [02:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9897) while not a part of bootstrap's grid system z indexes play an important part

- [02:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9899) system z indexes play an important part in how our components overlay and

- [02:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9901) in how our components overlay and interact with one another

- [02:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9906) several bootstrap components utilize z-index z-index is also the html

- [02:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9910) z-index z-index is also the html feature let me show you

- [02:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9914) feature let me show you what is the index and i will also show

- [02:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9916) what is the index and i will also show you what is a display

- [02:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9924) okay it's a pretty simple thing

- [02:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9927) it's a pretty simple thing uh what does the index do is

- [02:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9931) uh what does the index do is it displays the order of the elements

- [02:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9943) okay here you try okay so you see since the z index of

- [02:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9946) okay so you see since the z index of text is bigger than the image image is

- [02:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9948) text is bigger than the image image is displayed at the back

- [02:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9950) displayed at the back and

- [02:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9952) and the index bigger thing is displayed at

- [02:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9955) the index bigger thing is displayed at front so you see image has

- [02:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9958) front so you see image has z index minus one

- [02:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9960) z index minus one and by default the index is zero

- [02:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9962) and by default the index is zero therefore this text is being

- [02:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9965) therefore this text is being written on the image if i make the z

- [02:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9967) written on the image if i make the z index one

- [02:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9969) index one and run it you see now uh it is

- [02:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9971) and run it you see now uh it is overlaying the

- [02:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9973) overlaying the text property

- [02:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9974) text property and display is same you can change the

- [02:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9976) and display is same you can change the display

- [02:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9978) display features

- [02:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9980) features of elements like html display

- [02:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9994) so display can have you see non-inline block and inline

- [02:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9996) you see non-inline block and inline block and display none means it will it

- [02:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=9999) block and display none means it will it won't be

- [02:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10001) won't be visible

- [02:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10002) visible display in line means it will be in line

- [02:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10005) display in line means it will be in line so you see there is a hello world and it

- [02:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10008) so you see there is a hello world and it is not visible here because it is

- [02:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10010) is not visible here because it is displayed on and there is hello world

- [02:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10012) displayed on and there is hello world here it is display inline so it is

- [02:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10014) here it is display inline so it is displayed like this

- [02:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10016) displayed like this then there is display block display

- [02:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10018) then there is display block display block takes entire

- [02:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10020) block takes entire uh rov

- [02:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10022) uh rov let me show you like this display in

- [02:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10024) let me show you like this display in line takes only

- [02:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10027) line takes only this

- [02:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10028) this and display in line block

- [02:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10037) like this so display in line and display inline

- [02:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10039) so display in line and display inline block may look you

- [02:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10041) block may look you may look like same but not you see

- [02:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10043) may look like same but not you see display in line is taking only

- [02:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10046) display in line is taking only 17.6

- [02:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10048) 17.6 pixel height

- [02:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10050) pixel height however when it is displayed in line

- [02:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10052) however when it is displayed in line block

- [02:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10053) block you see it is taking 80.4 pixel height

- [02:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10056) you see it is taking 80.4 pixel height and you see there is a

- [02:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10059) and you see there is a difference

- [02:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10060) difference uh

- [02:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10061) uh between up and down lines here

- [02:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10065) between up and down lines here but there is nothing such that here

- [02:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10068) but there is nothing such that here you will understand them as you use them

- [02:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10076) and for the index do they have anything special

- [02:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10079) special uh oh it shows their default z indexes

- [02:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10081) uh oh it shows their default z indexes so the index drop-down is 1000 sticky

- [02:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10084) so the index drop-down is 1000 sticky 1020

- [02:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10086) 1020 the index fixed is like this one 1030

- [02:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10090) the index fixed is like this one 1030 model back

- [02:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10091) model back drop 1040 and such

- [02:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10096) drop 1040 and such let's continue with a reboot

- [02:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10107) reboot reboot a collection of element specific

- [02:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10109) reboot a collection of element specific css changes in a single file kickstart

- [02:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10112) css changes in a single file kickstart bootstrap to provide an elegant

- [02:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10113) bootstrap to provide an elegant consistent and simple baseline to build

- [02:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10116) consistent and simple baseline to build upon

- [02:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10117) upon on this

- [02:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10122) approach reboot builds upon normalize providing

- [02:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10125) reboot builds upon normalize providing many html elements with somewhat

- [02:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10127) many html elements with somewhat opinionated styles using only element

- [02:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10129) opinionated styles using only element selectors

- [02:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10131) selectors additional styling is done only with

- [02:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10133) additional styling is done only with classes

- [02:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10134) classes for example we reboot some table styles

- [02:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10137) for example we reboot some table styles for a simpler baseline and later provide

- [02:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10139) for a simpler baseline and later provide dot table dot table bordered and more

- [02:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10143) dot table dot table bordered and more here are our guidelines and reasons for

- [02:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10144) here are our guidelines and reasons for choosing what to override and reboot

- [02:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10148) choosing what to override and reboot update some browser default values to

- [02:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10150) update some browser default values to use rems instead of ems for scalable

- [02:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10152) use rems instead of ems for scalable component spacing

- [02:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10154) component spacing avoid margin top

- [02:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10156) avoid margin top vertical margins can collapse yielding

- [02:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10159) vertical margins can collapse yielding unexpected results

- [02:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10161) unexpected results more importantly though a single

- [02:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10163) more importantly though a single direction of margin is a simpler mental

- [02:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10165) direction of margin is a simpler mental model

- [02:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10167) model for easier scaling across device sizes

- [02:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10169) for easier scaling across device sizes block elements should use rims for

- [02:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10171) block elements should use rims for margins

- [02:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10173) margins keep declarations of font-related

- [02:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10175) keep declarations of font-related properties to a minimum using inherit

- [02:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10177) properties to a minimum using inherit whenever

- [02:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10178) whenever possible page defaults

- [02:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10182) possible page defaults okay there is a lot of information

- [02:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10184) okay there is a lot of information regarding a

- [02:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10185) regarding a heading

- [02:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10187) heading and

- [02:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10189) and each

- [02:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10190) each browser may show

- [02:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10192) browser may show a different uh

- [02:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10194) a different uh [Music]

- [02:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10200) may may display differently the different chords

- [02:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10202) different chords so let me show you an example

- [02:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10208) okay um [Music]

- [02:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10215) let's see the code here

- [02:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10222) okay so there is example legend and form okay

- [02:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10225) so there is example legend and form okay i'm going to

- [02:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10226) i'm going to [Music]

- [02:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10227) [Music] copy and paste

- [02:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10230) copy and paste to our

- [02:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10232) to our page here

- [02:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10241) and then i will have another static html file to see how it looks

- [02:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10243) static html file to see how it looks okay

- [02:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10245) okay so to have a static html file

- [02:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10255) let's add it to our www route static pages or we have test.html already

- [02:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10258) pages or we have test.html already so

- [02:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10269) okay okay

- [02:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10271) okay so let's see the difference

- [02:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10277) okay this is how this output is

- [02:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10281) this output is formatted with bootstrap 5 you see

- [02:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10284) formatted with bootstrap 5 you see buttons

- [02:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10286) buttons options

- [02:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10288) options text area

- [02:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10289) text area update time picker

- [02:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10292) update time picker whatever

- [02:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10293) whatever okay

- [02:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10295) okay password

- [02:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10296) password okay another daytime picker like this

- [02:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10300) okay another daytime picker like this input buttons resets and such

- [02:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10303) input buttons resets and such and then uh let's see how this is

- [02:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10306) and then uh let's see how this is looking in our static page when there is

- [02:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10310) looking in our static page when there is no bootstrap

- [02:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10312) no bootstrap so

- [02:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10314) so it will be test hdmi okay

- [02:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10317) it will be test hdmi okay so this is the display of a browser

- [02:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10320) so this is the display of a browser itself

- [02:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10322) itself you see the difference right

- [02:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10324) you see the difference right for example legend is displayed like

- [02:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10326) for example legend is displayed like here this here

- [02:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10328) here this here and inputs font everything is looking

- [02:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10333) and inputs font everything is looking different for example example number is

- [02:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10335) different for example example number is like this and example number is like

- [02:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10338) like this and example number is like this here

- [02:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10340) this here this is range range is looking like this

- [02:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10342) this is range range is looking like this buttons are different example select is

- [02:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10345) buttons are different example select is like this and here it is like this check

- [02:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10348) like this and here it is like this check boxes like this and here it is like this

- [02:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10352) boxes like this and here it is like this option is like this text area

- [02:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10355) option is like this text area looking like this

- [02:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10358) looking like this okay example code is like

- [02:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10360) okay example code is like here's

- [02:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10362) here's uh buttons are looking like this and now

- [02:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10364) uh buttons are looking like this and now let's see how it looks in a edge

- [02:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10372) okay in edge it is looking like this uh

- [02:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10373) uh so here it is blue here it is gray

- [02:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10378) so here it is blue here it is gray buttons are like this this is also a

- [02:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10380) buttons are like this this is also a modern browser so there is not much

- [02:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10382) modern browser so there is not much difference

- [02:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10383) difference and then we load our

- [02:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10387) and then we load our bootstrap

- [02:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10388) bootstrap version okay now when we use bootstrap

- [02:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10391) version okay now when we use bootstrap version it is pretty much same

- [02:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10394) version it is pretty much same and let's try with opera as well

- [02:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10402) if we had some older browser installers we could do a test but i don't have

- [02:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10405) we could do a test but i don't have right now

- [02:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10407) right now okay and then this is the opera there

- [02:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10409) okay and then this is the opera there are still some differences between opera

- [02:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10412) are still some differences between opera and firefox

- [02:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10414) and firefox in the range in the buttons

- [02:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10417) in the range in the buttons let's also see the static test as well

- [02:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10433) okay so the the main uh

- [02:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10434) the main uh thing of

- [02:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10444) reboot is to have as much as possibly

- [02:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10447) as much as possibly looking same

- [02:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10449) looking same uh

- [02:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10450) uh in different browsers to html elements

- [02:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10453) in different browsers to html elements this makes huge difference in

- [02:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10455) this makes huge difference in mobile version

- [02:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10457) mobile version different mobile browsers in older

- [02:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10459) different mobile browsers in older version of internet explorer

- [02:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10461) version of internet explorer and such

- [02:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10467) so you see there can be also black block code in line elements

- [02:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10470) code in line elements html hidden attributes

- [02:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10473) html hidden attributes and about typography

- [02:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10476) and about typography there is also global settings so let's

- [02:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10478) there is also global settings so let's see how headers are looking

- [02:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10480) see how headers are looking this is also important

- [02:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10486) so i'm going to add headers here and some

- [02:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10488) and some name line

- [02:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10495) and let's also see in our bootstrap version

- [02:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10498) in our bootstrap version okay so these are

- [02:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10500) okay so these are headers when there is no bootstrap and

- [02:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10502) headers when there is no bootstrap and this is our headers

- [02:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10504) this is our headers and this bootstrap you see how different

- [02:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10506) and this bootstrap you see how different they are looking

- [02:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10511) and the

- [02:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10512) the positioning the margin padding

- [02:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10514) positioning the margin padding everything is different and let's see

- [02:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10517) everything is different and let's see how much difference this make in

- [02:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10519) how much difference this make in internet explorer

- [02:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10521) internet explorer okay when there is a

- [02:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10523) okay when there is a static

- [02:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10529) page they are looking like this okay modern browsers are pretty much

- [02:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10532) modern browsers are pretty much same

- [02:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10533) same looking but in the

- [02:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10536) looking but in the uh

- [02:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10537) uh previous times it wasn't like this

- [02:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10539) previous times it wasn't like this believe me because i remember that

- [02:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10543) believe me because i remember that okay [Music]

- [02:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10549) yeah you see the difference is somewhat bigger here

- [02:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10556) okay so what is this about being a reboot

- [02:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10557) reboot they are standardizing the

- [02:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10560) they are standardizing the display of

- [02:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10562) display of different things

- [02:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10563) different things and different

- [02:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10571) browsers for example a block code let's add a block quarter

- [02:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10578) by the modern browsers as i said is almost identical

- [02:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10584) okay in the static page it is looking like this and in bootstrap

- [02:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10587) like this and in bootstrap block code is like this

- [02:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10593) so in uh edge it is like this and here's like

- [02:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10596) edge it is like this and here's like this

- [02:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10610) okay you can also have figure below quarter class

- [02:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10612) quarter class and figure caption like this

- [02:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10616) and figure caption like this probably this wouldn't work in a

- [02:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10621) probably this wouldn't work in a static page but i don't know let's test

- [02:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10624) static page but i don't know let's test that

- [02:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10630) maybe in older things do i have explorer installers

- [02:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10633) do i have explorer installers yeah there is nintendo explorer so now

- [02:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10635) yeah there is nintendo explorer so now we can see the difference better

- [02:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10637) we can see the difference better this is an older browser

- [02:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10642) uh so

- [02:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10648) okay this is how it looks in a static page it is like this and

- [02:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10650) page it is like this and this is how it looks in

- [02:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10652) this is how it looks in you see the difference quality

- [02:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10654) you see the difference quality difference it is

- [02:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10655) difference it is really

- [02:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10656) really obvious

- [02:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10658) obvious and let's also test in

- [02:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10665) older browser explorer which is a nightmare

- [02:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10667) which is a nightmare browser for developers believe me

- [02:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10671) browser for developers believe me it doesn't even support tops probably

- [02:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10674) it doesn't even support tops probably okay so

- [02:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10676) okay so this is how it looks in all the

- [02:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10678) this is how it looks in all the explorers

- [02:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10687) and let's now test our bootstrap version this is also not the oldest version

- [02:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10688) this is also not the oldest version though this is the explorer

- [02:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10692) though this is the explorer let's see the version of this

- [02:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10700) uh win version 20 yeah and you see with push up they are

- [02:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10702) and you see with push up they are becoming pretty much same

- [02:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10705) becoming pretty much same as much as possible

- [02:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10708) as much as possible and it is working

- [02:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10717) why zooming zoom on is not resetting okay now it is reset

- [02:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10721) okay now it is reset okay um

- [02:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10723) okay um let me reset here too

- [02:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10731) okay and mother else

- [02:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10736) so usually there is alignments like this figure text center

- [02:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10738) figure text center located

- [02:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10744) text and yeah this is a really good example these are

- [02:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10747) example these are okay individual we have any examples to

- [02:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10750) okay individual we have any examples to make an example

- [02:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10752) make an example so these are the font families that are

- [02:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10755) so these are the font families that are natively supported i think

- [02:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10776) okay let's see how it looks

- [02:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10788) okay you see it is formatted like this it looks pretty cool

- [02:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10791) it looks pretty cool yeah

- [02:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10792) yeah and in here we don't even see it

- [02:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10795) and in here we don't even see it because we don't edit here

- [02:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10797) because we don't edit here it is formatted like this

- [03:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10802) okay and

- [03:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10803) and you see these are encoded

- [03:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10806) you see these are encoded tags uh

- [03:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10808) tags uh this character so they won't be

- [03:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10811) this character so they won't be processed as a special character

- [03:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10815) processed as a special character and

- [03:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10841) [Music] so these headings this is lists

- [03:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10849) like this you can also have

- [03:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10852) you can also have bolts how do we set bolt

- [03:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10877) let's add it to our page

- [03:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10884) okay this is here like this

- [03:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10886) like this and

- [03:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10887) and [Music]

- [03:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10889) [Music] let's see

- [03:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10890) let's see the bolt example

- [03:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10904) by the way i have copies list okay so this is a bold example

- [03:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10917) okay so for building the text i think it is default bolt ddt

- [03:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10934) dt are bolded and dd are reset they are reading as like this

- [03:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10948) this is or an order at least an order at

- [03:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10951) is or an order at least an order at least example

- [03:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10956) like here we can also

- [03:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10959) we can also put time inside the container like v

- [03:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10961) put time inside the container like v plus

- [03:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10964) plus containers

- [03:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10972) okay the web design is something that has no

- [03:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10976) the web design is something that has no limits

- [03:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10977) limits it is totally up to you how you

- [03:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10979) it is totally up to you how you design your web page looks then we have

- [03:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10982) design your web page looks then we have quote blocks in line codes

- [03:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=10986) quote blocks in line codes okay uh

- [03:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=11007) what blocks so for code blocks we use code like this

- [03:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=11010) so for code blocks we use code like this there is also prayer

- [03:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=11012) there is also prayer and previous element is reason to remove

- [03:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=11015) and previous element is reason to remove its margin top yeah

- [03:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=11018) its margin top yeah so you can use prayer let's see the

- [03:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=11020) so you can use prayer let's see the difference of prayer

- [03:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=11022) difference of prayer so this is some prayer and not there

- [03:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=11056) okay when we use prayer you see they are uh displayed at the

- [03:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=11058) uh displayed at the oh without prayer they are

- [03:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=11061) oh without prayer they are at the same line

- [03:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=11063) at the same line and when we have played like here

- [03:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=11067) and when we have played like here they are displayed as another line

- [03:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=11071) they are displayed as another line yeah

- [03:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=11073) yeah so

- [03:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=11074) so player is uh passes this

- [03:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=11078) player is uh passes this over p i think

- [03:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=11086) no no no not related to p so how new line is percent with player

- [03:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=11108) i think each code is being passed uh [Music]

- [03:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=11111) [Music] no it is not that

- [03:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=11113) no it is not that so what does predator

- [03:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=11122) code blocks use pre-s for multiple lines of code

- [03:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=11125) use pre-s for multiple lines of code once again be sure to escape any angle

- [03:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=11128) once again be sure to escape any angle brackets in the code for proper

- [03:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=11129) brackets in the code for proper rendering

- [03:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=11131) rendering the pre element is reset to remove its

- [03:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=11133) the pre element is reset to remove its margin top and use rem units for its

- [03:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=11135) margin top and use rem units for its margin bottom

- [03:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=11143) then there's variables variables are first like this

- [03:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=11151) okay [Music]

- [03:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=11153) [Music] you see they are displayed like this

- [03:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=11155) you see they are displayed like this beautifully

- [03:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=11165) and then there is usual input which uses key bd

- [03:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=11168) key bd interesting

- [03:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=11183) okay to switch directors type cd cd is put inside qvd tag okay and what

- [03:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=11189) cd is put inside qvd tag okay and what happens when we put this into the

- [03:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=11195) index.html static index page

- [03:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=11198) static index page i'm in the test page here

- [03:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=11202) i'm in the test page here [Music]

- [03:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=11204) [Music] you see

- [03:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=11205) you see it is being displayed like this

- [03:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=11209) it is being displayed like this when there is no bootstrap

- [03:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=11211) when there is no bootstrap clay is working but it is working like

- [03:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=11214) clay is working but it is working like this

- [03:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=11216) this then there is sample output

- [03:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=11219) then there is sample output okay

- [03:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=11239) okay these are all html tags

- [03:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=11249) then there's tables uh tables are what we know

- [03:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=11251) we know however tables are pretty much

- [03:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=11253) however tables are pretty much differently parsed in different

- [03:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=11256) differently parsed in different browser so

- [03:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=11309) okay so this is how table is displayed

- [03:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=11314) so this is how table is displayed and

- [03:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=11315) and at static page you see it is displayed

- [03:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=11318) at static page you see it is displayed like this

- [03:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=11319) like this by the way

- [03:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=11321) by the way we have borders

- [03:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=11339) okay forms forms out like this

- [03:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=11342) forms forms out like this monitors on buttons

- [03:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=11345) monitors on buttons so if you set

- [03:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=11346) so if you set a roll button

- [03:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=11348) a roll button i think it makes a difference

- [03:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=11373) okay now button elements button it is being displayed like this

- [03:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=11383) oh i see so it is having uh you see

- [03:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=11386) so it is having uh you see this when you hover this um clicking

- [03:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=11389) this when you hover this um clicking icon

- [03:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=11392) icon it is cursor actually

- [03:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=11394) it is cursor actually so when we set another row like what

- [03:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=11397) so when we set another row like what roles do we have

- [03:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=11411) okay so the first one is regular text and second one is behaving like a bubble

- [03:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=11415) and second one is behaving like a bubble and then there is misc

- [03:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=11417) and then there is misc which has address

- [03:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=11450) okay pointers on buttons okay

- [03:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=11456) and we have misc elements which are addressed

- [03:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=11465) so let's see the source code of address which is here

- [03:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=11477) so we have a code

- [03:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=11478) code p tag

- [03:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=11480) p tag and we have address stack here

- [03:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=11483) and we have address stack here we have strong this is a regular html

- [03:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=11486) we have strong this is a regular html this is the abbreviation

- [03:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=11493) okay i think this is html element as well

- [03:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=11501) so the strong is regular strong nothing fancy

- [03:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=11511) okay we can see so this it says this abbreviation of phone

- [03:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=11513) abbreviation of phone so when we hover our mouse

- [03:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=11516) so when we hover our mouse it shows the abbreviation title here

- [03:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=11539) and there is inline element so observation yeah

- [03:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=11549) i think we have seen my own hands under

- [03:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=11550) under summary so the summary is working like

- [03:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=11553) summary so the summary is working like this

- [03:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=11555) this let's see that

- [03:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=11571) [Music] let's test it

- [03:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=11581) okay you see somebody has auto collapsing option which is cool

- [03:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=11585) collapsing option which is cool and we can also set whether it is auto

- [03:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=11587) and we can also set whether it is auto collapsed or not how

- [03:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=11590) collapsed or not how on the summary uh ucp more info and you

- [03:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=11594) on the summary uh ucp more info and you see details and details open if details

- [03:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=11597) see details and details open if details is open it is by default open here

- [03:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=11601) is open it is by default open here if it is not it is hidden

- [03:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=11603) if it is not it is hidden so user can see it and click on it or

- [03:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=11605) so user can see it and click on it or not

- [03:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=11608) not i wonder if this would work

- [03:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=11617) okay and

- [03:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=11625) okay we have seen uh that as well and then there is hidden attributes

- [03:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=11626) and then there is hidden attributes html5 adds a new global attribute hidden

- [03:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=11636) html5 adds a new global attribute named hidden which is styled as display none

- [03:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=11638) hidden which is styled as display none by default

- [03:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=11640) by default borrowing an idea from pure css we

- [03:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=11642) borrowing an idea from pure css we improve upon this default by making

- [03:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=11644) improve upon this default by making hidden display none important to help

- [03:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=11647) hidden display none important to help prevent its display from getting

- [03:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=11648) prevent its display from getting accidentally overwritten

- [03:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=11651) accidentally overwritten okay so it is like this

- [03:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=11653) okay so it is like this and here

- [03:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=11659) by the way there is something really important that you need to know

- [03:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=11661) important that you need to know jquery

- [03:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=11662) jquery incompatibility hidden is not compatible

- [03:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=11665) incompatibility hidden is not compatible with jquery's dollar dot hide and dollar

- [03:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=11668) with jquery's dollar dot hide and dollar dot show methods

- [03:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=11671) dot show methods therefore we don't currently especially

- [03:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=11673) therefore we don't currently especially endorse hidden over other techniques for

- [03:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=11675) endorse hidden over other techniques for managing the display of elements

- [03:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=11678) managing the display of elements okay so display instead of display

- [03:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=11681) okay so display instead of display hidden you should use this visibility

- [03:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=11685) hidden you should use this visibility [Music]

- [03:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=11687) [Music] class

- [03:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=11692) to merely toggle the visibility of an element meaning its display is not

- [03:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=11694) element meaning its display is not modified and the element can still

- [03:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=11696) modified and the element can still affect the flow of the document use the

- [03:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=11698) affect the flow of the document use the dot invisible class instead

- [03:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=11700) dot invisible class instead okay you should use invisible class for

- [03:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=11702) okay you should use invisible class for jquery to work

- [03:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=11706) jquery to work um

- [03:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=11707) um i will explain you this with an example

- [03:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=11710) i will explain you this with an example in a in a moment

- [03:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=11716) okay so let's say we have input type hidden or

- [03:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=11720) let's say we have input type hidden or let's instead of that

- [03:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=11722) let's instead of that let's add a div

- [03:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=11724) let's add a div class equal to hidden

- [03:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=11734) or display none none

- [03:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=11737) none and let's set id

- [03:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=11739) and let's set id equal to test one

- [03:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=11743) equal to test one and test one

- [03:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=11745) and test one let's also have

- [03:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=11747) let's also have by the way this doesn't affect the flow

- [03:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=11756) it's a visibility hidden i think visually hidden yeah

- [03:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=11758) visually hidden yeah and this will be tested

- [03:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=11762) and this will be tested so

- [03:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=11763) so let's add like this and let's see the

- [03:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=11767) let's add like this and let's see the flow

- [03:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=11775) okay summary summary and summary are all hidden right now

- [03:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=11777) hidden right now and what is the difference between them

- [03:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=11783) yes you see display none has display

- [03:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=11785) you see display none has display non-important

- [03:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=11787) non-important visually hidden has

- [03:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=11790) visually hidden has [Music]

- [03:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=11793) [Music] let's see

- [03:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=11841) yeah you see it uses position absolute and it has margin -1 therefore it is not

- [03:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=11844) and it has margin -1 therefore it is not inside this page it is at the

- [03:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=11847) inside this page it is at the margin minus one of page so it is not

- [03:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=11850) margin minus one of page so it is not visible on the screen

- [03:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=11868) an example to see so we have height and show

- [03:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=11870) so we have height and show currently this element is

- [03:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=11874) currently this element is you see this has no display block and

- [03:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=11877) you see this has no display block and when we hide it it becomes display none

- [03:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=11880) when we hide it it becomes display none when we show it it works

- [03:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=11884) when we show it it works so it removes this

- [03:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=11886) so it removes this uh hide and show

- [03:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=11903) um if we make this

- [03:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=11912) oh i think it won't work if you made this display hidden not

- [03:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=11914) this display hidden not not

- [03:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=11917) not okay no there is no display hidden

- [03:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=11992) okay i think it works with display but not working with visibility

- [03:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=11995) not working with visibility okay visual hidden

- [03:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=11997) okay visual hidden style

- [03:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=12000) style there is visibility

- [03:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=12002) there is visibility and

- [03:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=12012) i will show you and let's have another test as

- [03:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=12016) and let's have another test as s3

- [03:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=12017) s3 instead of usually hidden i will use

- [03:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=12021) instead of usually hidden i will use okay

- [03:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=12024) okay plus visibility

- [03:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=12027) plus visibility okay there is invisible yeah

- [03:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=12030) okay there is invisible yeah so let's test it

- [03:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=12040) okay so you see uh invisible is taking a space here

- [03:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=12043) a space here uh so this is the difference it is

- [03:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=12045) uh so this is the difference it is affecting the flow of the

- [03:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=12048) affecting the flow of the uh

- [03:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=12049) uh [Music]

- [03:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=12052) [Music] flow of the your document this is what

- [03:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=12054) flow of the your document this is what the difference between invisible

- [03:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=12057) the difference between invisible visibility hidden and displaying

- [03:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=12066) and then difference

- [03:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=12068) difference and let's also make an example of jquery

- [03:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=12076) okay so i'm going to have

- [03:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=12078) so i'm going to have a visibility hidden thing here

- [03:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=12092) hidden and here let's run it so hide show you see hide and show is

- [03:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=12094) so hide show you see hide and show is not working when visibility is set

- [03:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=12096) not working when visibility is set hidden

- [03:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=12098) hidden okay so the shove and height is not

- [03:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=12100) okay so the shove and height is not compatible with visibility hidden it is

- [03:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=12102) compatible with visibility hidden it is only convert compatible with

- [03:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=12104) only convert compatible with display now

- [03:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=12141) okay typography okay

- [03:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=12152) typography documentation and examples for bootstrap

- [03:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=12154) documentation and examples for bootstrap typography including global settings

- [03:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=12157) typography including global settings headings body text lists and more

- [03:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=12166) h1 h2 h3 uh header thoughts customized headings for example let's

- [03:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=12169) customized headings for example let's see

- [03:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=12173) okay [Music]

- [03:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=12176) [Music] um

- [03:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=12177) um let's refresh

- [03:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=12187) okay uses some with faded secondary text it looks cool

- [03:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=12189) it looks cool um there are display like this

- [03:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=12192) um there are display like this so what is the difference between

- [03:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=12194) so what is the difference between display headings

- [03:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=12199) [Music] you see display headings is different

- [03:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=12202) you see display headings is different than regular headings like this

- [03:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=12205) than regular headings like this so you can also use display headings

- [03:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=12211) okay let's

- [03:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=12212) let's check it out

- [03:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=12214) check it out you see they are even bigger and

- [03:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=12218) you see they are even bigger and leaners

- [03:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=12223) then there's also a class custom class

- [03:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=12227) a class custom class like this

- [03:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=12234) okay and there is inline

- [03:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=12237) and there is inline text elements

- [03:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=12240) text elements we can test them

- [03:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=12243) we can test them like this

- [03:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=12250) okay highlighting you see treated as deleted text this is

- [03:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=12254) you see treated as deleted text this is no longer accurate they look exactly

- [03:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=12256) no longer accurate they look exactly same

- [03:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=12258) same there is dell and s

- [03:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=12264) what is the difference i think they look exactly the same then there is addition

- [03:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=12267) exactly the same then there is addition to documents and render underline it

- [03:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=12271) to documents and render underline it okay so these are just regular um html

- [03:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=12275) okay so these are just regular um html tags actually modern html tags but maybe

- [03:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=12280) tags actually modern html tags but maybe some styling with uh

- [03:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=12282) some styling with uh bootstrap

- [03:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=12287) okay you see these stocks should be used for semantic proposals so these are

- [03:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=12289) for semantic proposals so these are related to semantic

- [03:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=12291) related to semantic webvenon engine

- [03:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=12294) webvenon engine search engine clouds or websites they

- [03:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=12297) search engine clouds or websites they can give

- [03:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=12299) can give some extra

- [03:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=12300) some extra meaning

- [03:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=12302) meaning to your text with using this

- [03:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=12308) okay then there is text utilities there is abbreviation

- [03:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=12310) is abbreviation like this

- [03:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=12312) like this blue code and naming a source okay we

- [03:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=12314) blue code and naming a source okay we have seen all of these actually

- [03:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=12317) have seen all of these actually then there's lists our legal lists

- [03:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=12321) then there's lists our legal lists there's inline item

- [03:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=12324) there's inline item oh

- [03:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=12324) oh um

- [03:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=12326) um there is

- [03:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=12327) there is description list alignment this is

- [03:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=12329) description list alignment this is something uh important

- [03:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=12337) okay so dl and dt are uh name value pairs

- [03:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=12339) name value pairs so you see dl elements represents an

- [03:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=12341) so you see dl elements represents an association list consisting of zero or

- [03:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=12344) association list consisting of zero or more name value groups

- [03:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=12354) okay uh sorry about interruption so

- [03:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=12357) so let's copy and paste this into our

- [03:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=12360) let's copy and paste this into our page

- [03:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=12362) page okay so dl and dt we were reading

- [03:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=12364) okay so dl and dt we were reading keyboard as that

- [03:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=12366) keyboard as that means

- [03:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=12367) means the l element represents an association

- [03:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=12369) the l element represents an association this consisting of zero or more name

- [03:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=12371) this consisting of zero or more name value groups a description list and a

- [03:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=12374) value groups a description list and a value group consists of one or more

- [03:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=12376) value group consists of one or more names dt elements followed by one or

- [03:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=12378) names dt elements followed by one or more values dd elements

- [03:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=12381) more values dd elements and okay so we have dl

- [03:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=12384) and okay so we have dl as a row then we have dt as a class

- [03:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=12388) as a row then we have dt as a class as a column here description list and dd

- [03:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=12391) as a column here description list and dd as a another class a description is

- [03:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=12393) as a another class a description is perfect for defining terms

- [03:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=12396) perfect for defining terms i'm going to face the page

- [03:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=12398) i'm going to face the page okay we can see that

- [03:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=12401) okay we can see that okay

- [03:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=12404) okay so

- [03:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=12405) so you see description is a description is

- [03:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=12406) you see description is a description is perfect for defining terms

- [03:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=12409) perfect for defining terms a term defined definition for the term

- [03:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=12412) a term defined definition for the term and some more placeholder definition

- [03:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=12414) and some more placeholder definition text

- [03:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=12415) text so there is another dtd

- [03:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=12419) so there is another dtd and this dd have two paragraphs

- [03:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=12421) and this dd have two paragraphs and then we have dtdd

- [03:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=12426) and then we have dtdd and inside the tdd we have another dl

- [03:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=12430) and inside the tdd we have another dl which is to define more nested

- [03:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=12432) which is to define more nested definition list

- [03:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=12434) definition list and they are being

- [03:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=12436) and they are being positioned like this

- [03:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=12439) positioned like this and i can cover them inside a

- [03:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=12443) and i can cover them inside a div

- [03:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=12445) div class equal to

- [03:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=12454) [Music] okay class equal to container

- [03:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=12462) it would have some positioning and formatting by default

- [03:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=12466) formatting by default okay

- [03:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=12476) all right so responsive font sizes in bootstrap 5 we have enabled responsive

- [03:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=12478) bootstrap 5 we have enabled responsive font sizes by default unless it has to

- [03:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=12480) font sizes by default unless it has to scale more naturally

- [03:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=12482) scale more naturally wow this is not nice

- [03:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=12486) wow this is not nice uh how do we set that

- [03:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=12507) okay so using the functions we need to have

- [03:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=12540) so we have we can have fluid value on site selector

- [03:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=12577) let's test this i'm going to add this into my

- [03:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=12584) layout cs html in here

- [03:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=12593) okay i think this media will be include style

- [03:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=12595) style so let's find a style

- [03:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=12597) so let's find a style we have media double at

- [03:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=12600) we have media double at and there is max width like this let's

- [03:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=12603) and there is max width like this let's set it

- [03:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=12605) set it 1000 pixel

- [03:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=12610) and it has padding calculate function i wonder if this will work or not

- [03:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=12613) wonder if this will work or not let's see

- [03:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=12639) maybe we should look for a better example

- [03:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=12643) okay go strap five

- [03:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=12645) go strap five expose your font size

- [03:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=12648) expose your font size example

- [03:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=12653) and let's see how can we do that um

- [03:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=12671) yeah as you can see the font size changes

- [03:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=12672) changes so how do we do that

- [03:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=12679) oh device it is kw

- [03:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=12682) device it is kw ew um

- [03:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=12691) oh vw is the import which that is not what we want actually

- [03:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=12694) what we want actually we need example of

- [03:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=12697) we need example of okay there is if screen size font size

- [03:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=12700) okay there is if screen size font size no this is also not what we want

- [03:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=12714) okay ah here

- [03:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=12715) ah here font size calculates so it uses this

- [03:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=12724) [Music] function

- [03:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=12726) function i'm going to edit here

- [03:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=12729) i'm going to edit here so it uses media screen

- [03:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=12732) so it uses media screen minimum widths

- [03:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=12733) minimum widths um

- [03:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=12735) um okay

- [03:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=12745) okay so it uses a calculate function um

- [03:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=12746) um and it uses some dynamic yeah v port i

- [03:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=12749) and it uses some dynamic yeah v port i see

- [03:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=12757) okay let's see if it makes any changes to our

- [03:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=12759) to our yeah it did it made the font size even

- [03:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=12762) yeah it did it made the font size even bigger

- [03:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=12764) bigger and as we reduce the

- [03:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=12767) and as we reduce the viewport size it will get

- [03:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=12770) viewport size it will get smaller like this yeah

- [03:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=12773) smaller like this yeah so it is up to you how you want to set

- [03:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=12775) so it is up to you how you want to set it

- [03:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=12777) it i would say this is too weak

- [03:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=12790) also this is how you set responsive uh font size

- [03:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=12792) uh font size with

- [03:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=12794) with a

- [03:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=12795) a calculate

- [03:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=12796) calculate method

- [03:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=12799) method okay

- [03:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=12804) okay i'm not going to implement this for now

- [03:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=12805) now so let's

- [03:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=12807) so let's make this as a command

- [03:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=12817) okay [Music]

- [03:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=12824) typography website headings

- [03:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=12829) um display headings

- [03:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=12851) we are going to see text utilities more in utilities

- [03:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=12853) in utilities parts so i will just pass it

- [03:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=12856) parts so i will just pass it abbreviations

- [03:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=12871) alignments you see text center these are all class

- [03:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=12873) all class so it is centering the text

- [03:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=12881) yeah alignment [Music]

- [03:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=12884) [Music] and lists

- [03:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=12892) okay description list alignments

- [03:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=12914) so i think we would also have some font sizing

- [03:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=12917) font sizing maybe we can modify this to be a little

- [03:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=12919) maybe we can modify this to be a little bit smaller

- [03:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=12930) yeah let's make it 22 and let's see how it looks

- [03:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=12936) okay so what is the pixel size of this let's

- [03:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=12939) so what is the pixel size of this let's check it out

- [03:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=12943) um it is using calculate method as you can

- [03:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=12946) it is using calculate method as you can see here

- [03:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=12948) see here so let's see the computed

- [03:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=12955) font size is 21 pixel if you want to make it smaller let's

- [03:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=12957) if you want to make it smaller let's make this 23

- [03:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=12960) make this 23 and see

- [03:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=12966) yeah now the completed font size is

- [03:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=12970) now the completed font size is 18 and as the list gets

- [03:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=12973) 18 and as the list gets as the security side gets smaller

- [03:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=12976) as the security side gets smaller what is the computers now

- [03:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=12979) what is the computers now it is 16 so the minimum complete size is

- [03:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=12982) it is 16 so the minimum complete size is 16 and it gets bigger as this

- [03:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=12985) 16 and it gets bigger as this uh display

- [03:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=12988) uh display uh screen size gets bigger yeah not bad

- [03:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=12991) uh screen size gets bigger yeah not bad right now

- [03:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=12992) right now okay okay we can move to the images

- [03:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=12996) okay okay we can move to the images which is really important

- [03:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=12999) which is really important okay

- [03:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=13004) images documentation and examples for opting

- [03:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=13006) documentation and examples for opting images into responsive behavior so they

- [03:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=13008) images into responsive behavior so they never become larger than their parent

- [03:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=13010) never become larger than their parent elements and add lightweight styles to

- [03:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=13012) elements and add lightweight styles to them all via classes

- [03:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=13015) them all via classes on this page

- [03:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=13017) on this page okay

- [03:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=13019) okay responsive images

- [03:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=13021) responsive images images in bootstrap are made responsive

- [03:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=13023) images in bootstrap are made responsive with dot img fluid

- [03:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=13026) with dot img fluid this applies max width 100

- [03:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=13029) this applies max width 100 and height auto to the image so that it

- [03:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=13031) and height auto to the image so that it scales with the parent element

- [03:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=13034) scales with the parent element so it makes it to scale with the parents

- [03:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=13037) so it makes it to scale with the parents and what does that mean let me show you

- [03:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=13040) and what does that mean let me show you okay so let's find a good

- [03:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=13043) okay so let's find a good big image for from our

- [03:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=13057) okay for example let's pick this image i am assuming that it's

- [03:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=13060) pick this image i am assuming that it's not peach

- [03:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=13062) not peach um maybe let's look for something

- [03:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=13067) um maybe let's look for something okay size large

- [03:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=13104) it was possible to get original size previously but now it is not working i

- [03:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=13107) previously but now it is not working i think i can get it from here

- [03:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=13109) think i can get it from here okay let's check the next yeah

- [03:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=13112) okay let's check the next yeah open image in new

- [03:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=13115) open image in new okay so this is a really big image as

- [03:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=13117) okay so this is a really big image as you can see it is

- [03:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=13119) you can see it is huge actually

- [03:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=13125) you see 7 over 7 000 pixels so i'm going to

- [03:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=13127) so i'm going to put that inside

- [03:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=13130) put that inside [Music]

- [03:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=13133) [Music] row and column

- [03:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=13135) row and column so let's

- [03:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=13137) so let's write it

- [03:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=13139) write it class containers

- [03:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=13143) class containers and let's have a

- [03:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=13153) and let's have leave

- [03:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=13154) leave class coulomb and let's make it three

- [03:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=13158) class coulomb and let's make it three so it will only use 25

- [03:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=13160) so it will only use 25 percent of the screen and

- [03:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=13163) percent of the screen and this will be src

- [03:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=13166) this will be src okay

- [03:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=13168) okay so let's see how it looks

- [03:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=13176) okay it is taking my entire uh screen it has broken my entire

- [03:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=13179) uh screen it has broken my entire responsiveness as you can see

- [03:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=13182) responsiveness as you can see it is fully overflowing

- [03:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=13185) it is fully overflowing so let's add class

- [03:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=13188) so let's add class uh

- [03:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=13189) uh pull it immediately and see what happens

- [03:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=13199) okay now you see it is fit into my column size by the way this also makes

- [03:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=13201) column size by the way this also makes the image bigger so you need to be

- [03:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=13203) the image bigger so you need to be careful with that

- [03:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=13205) careful with that such as

- [03:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=13207) such as let me show

- [03:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=13214) let's find an icon icon a small icon actually

- [03:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=13220) okay size icon

- [03:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=13259) [Music] okay let's use this one

- [03:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=13261) okay let's use this one let's get

- [03:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=13263) let's get four bits

- [03:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=13265) four bits pixel

- [03:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=13272) or maybe if you use svg it would get

- [03:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=13274) if you use svg it would get automatically sized

- [03:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=13276) automatically sized okay let's get

- [03:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=13283) here and i wonder if there's 64 pixel yeah here okay so this is the 64 pixel

- [03:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=13286) yeah here okay so this is the 64 pixel size and let's add another div column

- [03:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=13294) called okay three

- [03:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=13308) okay so i think it will get bigger uh to fit

- [03:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=13311) so i think it will get bigger uh to fit oh

- [03:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=13312) oh oh by default it is not getting bigger

- [03:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=13314) oh by default it is not getting bigger it is like this

- [03:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=13316) it is like this and then we add fluid

- [03:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=13318) and then we add fluid class like here

- [03:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=13320) class like here what happens

- [03:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=13328) okay this is still fine and what happens if i increase this

- [03:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=13330) and what happens if i increase this one's column size like this

- [03:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=13333) one's column size like this it will still fit into that place okay

- [03:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=13338) it will still fit into that place okay so it is working uh great however uh

- [03:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=13341) so it is working uh great however uh this will still load the entire image

- [03:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=13345) this will still load the entire image so you have to be careful with that

- [03:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=13348) so you have to be careful with that it will it will take a lot of time on

- [03:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=13360) network uh restricted that's when let's uh say that you are

- [03:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=13363) that's when let's uh say that you are using mobile internet

- [03:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=13365) using mobile internet and then there is thumbnails

- [03:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=13368) and then there is thumbnails so let's make this as image thumbnail

- [03:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=13370) so let's make this as image thumbnail and see what happens

- [03:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=13372) and see what happens i will add another

- [03:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=13375) i will add another column and i will make this

- [03:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=13377) column and i will make this image thumbnail

- [03:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=13379) image thumbnail like this you should you see visual

- [03:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=13381) like this you should you see visual studio is automatically

- [03:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=13383) studio is automatically telling me the thumbnail

- [03:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=13386) telling me the thumbnail okay so it is looking like this when you

- [03:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=13388) okay so it is looking like this when you set it as thumbnail

- [03:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=13391) set it as thumbnail however i would expect it to be

- [03:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=13393) however i would expect it to be clickable

- [03:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=13395) clickable to full size but it is not clickable to

- [03:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=13398) to full size but it is not clickable to full size

- [03:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=13400) full size and then we can use aligning of images

- [03:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=13402) and then we can use aligning of images like ground float and

- [03:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=13408) or such options that is picture element

- [03:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=13412) such options that is picture element okay if you use picture you can have

- [03:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=13416) okay if you use picture you can have multiple sources like this

- [03:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=13419) multiple sources like this it can be

- [03:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=13433) so if this src set is not working i will i

- [03:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=13436) if this src set is not working i will i think it will use this one

- [03:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=13438) think it will use this one let's test it out and see whether it is

- [03:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=13441) let's test it out and see whether it is working or not

- [03:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=13448) so i will add another division

- [03:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=13450) division plus row

- [03:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=13453) plus row and let's add another column here

- [03:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=13457) and let's add another column here and inside here i will add picture

- [03:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=13461) and inside here i will add picture instead of image

- [03:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=13466) okay so let's save this image but oh let's

- [03:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=13469) so let's save this image but oh let's find another one

- [03:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=13474) something that this

- [03:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=13476) this perhaps

- [03:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=13484) it is also slowing my page because it is in terms of size huge

- [03:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=13494) okay let's use this image for example so i will save this into our

- [03:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=13499) so i will save this into our [Music]

- [03:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=13502) [Music] wwe route static

- [03:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=13508) here images okay

- [03:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=13510) okay and we have also the url so let's set it

- [03:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=13512) and we have also the url so let's set it like that

- [03:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=13513) like that so this will be the class and

- [03:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=13517) so this will be the class and this will be the src sets

- [03:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=13520) this will be the src sets okay let's complete it from here

- [03:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=13534) okay so this is the roots

- [03:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=13536) roots yeah

- [03:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=13537) yeah by the way asp.net engine is resolving

- [03:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=13540) by the way asp.net engine is resolving this

- [03:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=13541) this uh so it would work only in index.html

- [03:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=13545) uh so it would work only in index.html if you put this inside

- [03:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=13547) if you put this inside static page it may not work

- [03:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=13550) static page it may not work so let's test it as well

- [03:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=13555) okay so let's check the network

- [03:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=13563) and see which one is loaded when i refresh

- [03:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=13566) when i refresh okay this is the documents

- [03:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=13570) okay this is the documents and

- [03:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=13571) and [Music]

- [03:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=13579) okay single image is loaded from you see our localhost

- [03:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=13581) our localhost so it didn't go to the

- [03:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=13583) so it didn't go to the uh

- [03:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=13584) uh [Music]

- [03:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=13586) [Music] it didn't go to this path this is not

- [03:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=13589) it didn't go to this path this is not loaded because this is loaded perfectly

- [03:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=13591) loaded because this is loaded perfectly fine

- [03:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=13592) fine and if it fails

- [03:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=13594) and if it fails i think it will load

- [03:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=13597) i think it will load external url let's test that

- [03:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=13600) external url let's test that so this has

- [03:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=13602) so this has failed

- [03:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=13604) failed and therefore

- [03:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=13607) and therefore um let's see

- [03:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=13611) um let's see okay this has you see status quote three

- [03:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=13614) okay this has you see status quote three or four zero four

- [03:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=13617) or four zero four so

- [03:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=13618) so um

- [03:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=13619) um it is loaded from

- [03:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=13639) okay um okay

- [03:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=13652) oh this was test.html this is why um

- [03:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=13654) um let's

- [03:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=13655) let's make this broken

- [03:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=13658) make this broken okay

- [03:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=13659) okay and let's refresh

- [03:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=13666) okay you see now 404 therefore

- [03:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=13667) therefore it should load from the oh it didn't

- [03:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=13670) it should load from the oh it didn't much interesting so why

- [03:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=13673) much interesting so why if it is not working what is the

- [03:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=13676) if it is not working what is the um [Music]

- [03:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=13678) [Music] point of using

- [03:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=13681) point of using src

- [03:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=13682) src [Music]

- [03:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=13697) okay source

- [03:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=13699) source is not working

- [03:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=13709) okay a picture five element has nothing for chrome

- [03:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=13738) i see it is used for rendering so what is the point of this

- [03:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=13759) so picture source media mean which you see you are able to define different

- [03:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=13761) you see you are able to define different images for based on the different

- [03:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=13764) images for based on the different media sizes

- [03:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=13770) so what is the difference between these two

- [03:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=13804) okay based on our [Music]

- [03:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=13806) [Music] maybe it should yeah it will be

- [03:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=13809) maybe it should yeah it will be different

- [03:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=13814) so this is not a backup url uh

- [03:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=13815) uh i think but we can't tell that it is

- [03:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=13818) i think but we can't tell that it is to define bases on

- [03:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=13821) to define bases on so this will be default url and if this

- [03:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=13825) so this will be default url and if this is not accepted with media queries like

- [03:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=13829) is not accepted with media queries like this

- [03:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=13830) this it will reuse it

- [03:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=13833) it will reuse it uh okay so this is not what we have

- [03:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=13835) uh okay so this is not what we have taught

- [03:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=13836) taught this is not a backup okay

- [03:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=13839) this is not a backup okay so if the secret size is very big we can

- [03:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=13841) so if the secret size is very big we can uh for example let's say

- [03:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=13844) uh for example let's say we can show this

- [03:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=13847) we can show this and if it is not we can show the other

- [03:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=13849) and if it is not we can show the other one so let's add a media

- [03:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=13853) one so let's add a media there

- [03:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=13858) so this will be small one

- [03:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=13861) this will be small one so max width will be like this

- [03:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=13865) so max width will be like this okay

- [03:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=13880) okay so when i reduce to uh media's signing size you see images are changing

- [03:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=13884) signing size you see images are changing okay

- [03:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=13910) aligning images like this rounded float start float and

- [03:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=13915) like this rounded float start float and rounded mx auto d block mx means margin

- [03:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=13922) right and left and d block is display block so it takes

- [03:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=13925) and d block is display block so it takes entire row

- [03:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=13928) entire row okay rounded like this and pictures

- [03:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=13953) all right so tables

- [03:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=13958) tables documentation and examples for opt-in

- [03:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=13960) documentation and examples for opt-in styling of tables given their prevalent

- [03:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=13963) styling of tables given their prevalent use in javascript plugins with bootstrap

- [03:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=13966) use in javascript plugins with bootstrap on this page

- [03:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=13972) overview due to the widespread use of table

- [03:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=13974) due to the widespread use of table elements across third-party widgets like

- [03:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=13976) elements across third-party widgets like calendars and date pickers bootstrap's

- [03:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=13979) calendars and date pickers bootstrap's tables are opt-in

- [03:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=13981) tables are opt-in add the baseclass.table to any table

- [03:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=13983) add the baseclass.table to any table then extend with our optional modifier

- [03:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=13985) then extend with our optional modifier classes or custom styles all table

- [03:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=13988) classes or custom styles all table styles are not inherited in bootstrap

- [03:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=13990) styles are not inherited in bootstrap meaning any nested tables can be styled

- [03:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=13993) meaning any nested tables can be styled independent from the parent

- [03:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=13995) independent from the parent using the most basic table markup here's

- [03:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=13997) using the most basic table markup here's how dot table based tables look in

- [03:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=13999) how dot table based tables look in bootstrap

- [03:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=14001) bootstrap okay so this is a regular table with a

- [03:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=14004) okay so this is a regular table with a table class from bootstrap let's see how

- [03:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=14006) table class from bootstrap let's see how it looks

- [03:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=14008) it looks okay here

- [03:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=14011) okay here and let's also have a

- [03:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=14014) and let's also have a another table which is not

- [03:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=14017) another table which is not using table class

- [03:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=14020) using table class here

- [03:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=14021) here and

- [03:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=14023) and let's

- [03:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=14025) let's get these ads

- [03:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=14031) it because this is a special character of

- [03:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=14032) of uh razer pages so the first one will be

- [03:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=14035) uh razer pages so the first one will be subtable and the second one will be a

- [03:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=14037) subtable and the second one will be a regular table

- [03:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=14039) regular table let's replace the page

- [03:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=14041) let's replace the page so you see this is the bootstrap table

- [03:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=14044) so you see this is the bootstrap table how well it is looking and this is just

- [03:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=14047) how well it is looking and this is just a regular table

- [03:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=14048) a regular table and bootstrap table is looking very good

- [03:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=14052) and bootstrap table is looking very good in every dimension

- [03:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=14055) in every dimension as you can see and this is the regular

- [03:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=14057) as you can see and this is the regular table

- [03:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=14062) okay and let's uh

- [03:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=14064) and let's uh continue

- [03:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=14070) okay there are some variants such as a table primary table secondary

- [03:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=14075) as a table primary table secondary these are the table uh classes for

- [03:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=14077) these are the table uh classes for example let's make this table primary

- [03:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=14079) example let's make this table primary class

- [03:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=14081) class and let's see how it looks

- [03:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=14086) okay oh

- [03:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=14098) interesting it is saying that this class does not

- [03:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=14101) it is saying that this class does not exist

- [03:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=14109) this is documentation five

- [03:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=14125) why it is not working

- [03:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=14135) okay on table level it didn't work let's try on

- [03:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=14137) try on for example

- [03:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=14138) for example [Music]

- [03:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=14141) [Music] cell level

- [03:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=14145) for example uh

- [03:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=14146) uh this one

- [03:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=14148) this one class equal to table

- [03:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=14152) class equal to table okay primary

- [03:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=14159) let's see okay it is not working

- [03:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=14161) okay it is not working so you can uh color them like this

- [03:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=14166) so you can uh color them like this okay why it is important to use such

- [03:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=14168) okay why it is important to use such colors conveying meaning to assistive

- [03:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=14171) colors conveying meaning to assistive technologies

- [03:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=14173) technologies using color to add meaning only provides

- [03:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=14175) using color to add meaning only provides a visual indication which will not be

- [03:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=14177) a visual indication which will not be conveyed to users of assistive

- [03:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=14179) conveyed to users of assistive technologies such as screen readers

- [03:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=14182) technologies such as screen readers ensure that information denoted by the

- [03:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=14184) ensure that information denoted by the color is either obvious from the content

- [03:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=14186) color is either obvious from the content itself eg the visible text or is

- [03:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=14189) itself eg the visible text or is included through alternative means such

- [03:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=14191) included through alternative means such as additional text hidden with the dot

- [03:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=14193) as additional text hidden with the dot visually hidden class okay

- [03:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=14196) visually hidden class okay and then there's

- [03:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=14197) and then there's accented tables accented tables

- [03:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=14201) accented tables accented tables striped rows

- [03:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=14203) striped rows use dot table stripe to add zebra

- [03:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=14205) use dot table stripe to add zebra striping to any table row within that

- [03:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=14207) striping to any table row within that body

- [03:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=14209) body so what does this do

- [03:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=14212) so what does this do table stripe it

- [03:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=14226) oh striped means that the rows colors are

- [03:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=14229) the rows colors are changing with every

- [03:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=14231) changing with every row

- [03:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=14238) let me show you okay uh so you see first one is great

- [03:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=14241) okay uh so you see first one is great second one is white third one is gray

- [03:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=14243) second one is white third one is gray second other one is uh white

- [03:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=14247) second other one is uh white um

- [03:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=14248) um then you can also add variants such as

- [03:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=14250) then you can also add variants such as table dark

- [03:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=14254) okay let's add that variant as well

- [03:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=14262) now this is a nice looking uh dark table

- [03:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=14270) and you can also have table success hoverable rows this is also a really

- [03:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=14273) hoverable rows this is also a really good addition so let's add that as well

- [03:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=14276) good addition so let's add that as well i think it can be

- [03:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=14278) i think it can be mix it

- [03:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=14286) yeah now you see we are able to hover over rows

- [03:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=14291) um yeah okay it's working

- [03:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=14293) yeah okay it's working thunder's active

- [03:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=14301) highlight a table robot cell by adding a active class so

- [03:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=14304) active class so let's add an active plus

- [03:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=14306) let's add an active plus [Music]

- [03:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=14308) [Music] td

- [03:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=14316) okay okay here you see active one has

- [03:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=14318) okay here you see active one has slightly different color

- [03:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=14321) slightly different color and

- [03:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=14334) okay it explains the [Music]

- [03:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=14336) [Music] background then there is borders so we

- [03:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=14338) background then there is borders so we can add table border it

- [03:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=14343) to our colossus like this

- [03:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=14356) and then we can change border colors such as

- [03:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=14360) then we can change border colors such as border primary

- [03:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=14363) border primary however since we are using dark harsh

- [03:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=14367) however since we are using dark harsh themed

- [03:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=14368) themed table

- [03:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=14369) table oh it looks cool nice

- [03:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=14373) oh it looks cool nice and

- [03:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=14374) and stable without borders time borderless

- [03:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=14376) stable without borders time borderless small tables

- [03:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=14379) small tables so if you had table small it will make

- [03:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=14381) so if you had table small it will make it more more compact by cutting also

- [03:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=14384) it more more compact by cutting also padding in half

- [03:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=14387) padding in half you see

- [03:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=14392) okay let's add that too table small

- [03:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=14395) table small there is also table responsive small

- [04:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=14414) okay it's looking pretty good and standard is vertical alignment

- [04:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=14419) and standard is vertical alignment okay table sets of t-head are always

- [04:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=14421) okay table sets of t-head are always vertically aligned bottom

- [04:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=14423) vertically aligned bottom and the other ones are vertically

- [04:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=14426) and the other ones are vertically aligned middle i think

- [04:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=14429) aligned middle i think so you can also change align bottom

- [04:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=14431) so you can also change align bottom align top

- [04:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=14432) align top for example music is aligned

- [04:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=14435) for example music is aligned middle i will make it align it up

- [04:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=14441) so let's

- [04:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=14442) let's for example one two three

- [04:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=14445) for example one two three four i'm going to make this as

- [04:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=14449) four i'm going to make this as um class

- [04:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=14452) um class align

- [04:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=14454) align top yeah

- [04:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=14459) okay five by the way i will add this to

- [04:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=14461) by the way i will add this to [Music]

- [04:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=14462) [Music] here let's see

- [04:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=14498) maybe because it's hate is not enough i'm not sure

- [04:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=14507) because it has the same padding from bottom top

- [04:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=14510) bottom top let's add this

- [04:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=14513) let's add this row and see if any difference

- [04:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=14520) okay no difference so since we have no extra space

- [04:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=14522) extra space it is like that but i think we can have

- [04:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=14536) h100 i think this will be h 100 percent okay to make any reference

- [04:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=14539) okay to make any reference so

- [04:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=14545) let's give this an id t1

- [04:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=14548) t1 and from tt1

- [04:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=14550) and from tt1 [Music]

- [04:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=14551) [Music] plus

- [04:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=14552) plus um

- [04:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=14553) um [Music]

- [04:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=14556) [Music] okay tr

- [04:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=14559) okay tr which i will make mean boom head 100

- [04:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=14563) which i will make mean boom head 100 pixel

- [04:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=14575) ah this is a class i mean i id therefore i have to use it like this

- [04:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=14592) is t hat and t1 yeah i know the reason so for this to work

- [04:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=14602) since there's any child selectors

- [04:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=14604) child selectors any level or perhaps

- [04:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=14625) because otherwise it is being direct discount descendants of the

- [04:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=14627) discount descendants of the [Music]

- [04:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=14628) [Music] okay stimulus working

- [04:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=14691) okay we did it correct so why it is not working

- [04:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=14703) let's make this as a class

- [04:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=14723) yeah now it's working so the id didn't work but now it is

- [04:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=14726) so the id didn't work but now it is working

- [04:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=14727) working and they are

- [04:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=14729) and they are aligned to the top currently

- [04:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=14733) aligned to the top currently uh

- [04:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=14734) uh so

- [04:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=14735) so to make them align its middle

- [04:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=14746) let's see [Music]

- [04:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=14754) for example let's try five plus align centers

- [04:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=14774) you're not working why

- [04:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=14802) okay when i use a line middle you see now there uh a line is middle and this

- [04:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=14805) now there uh a line is middle and this is only aligned as top yeah working

- [04:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=14809) is only aligned as top yeah working and the t head is aligned as

- [04:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=14813) and the t head is aligned as uh bottom

- [04:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=14814) uh bottom so using align middle is

- [04:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=14817) so using align middle is better and then you can have nesting

- [04:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=14829) so in the nesting we have uh t-body trtd down here table and b0

- [04:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=14834) uh t-body trtd down here table and b0 and b means

- [04:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=14836) and b means um

- [04:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=14847) margin and

- [04:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=14848) and b means margin button yeah

- [04:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=14852) b means margin button yeah okay so margin bottom is zero

- [04:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=14862) so inside of it there is no margin okay

- [04:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=14867) then how much it works anatomy table heads

- [04:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=14875) we can also change the t-head class

- [04:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=14877) the t-head class so for example here let's change it to

- [04:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=14880) so for example here let's change it to light

- [04:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=14881) light even though we use dark theme you see my

- [04:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=14884) even though we use dark theme you see my head can be light like this

- [04:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=14887) head can be light like this what other options there are

- [04:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=14898) warning for example let's make it morning the hat

- [04:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=14902) morning the hat and it is like yeah

- [04:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=14908) and then there's stable food so for food we can use tea food

- [04:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=14912) so for food we can use tea food and you can use captions

- [04:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=14915) and you can use captions so with caption

- [04:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=14917) so with caption i think it is being

- [04:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=14923) oh okay it is being added to the bottom of the server

- [04:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=14926) of the server of the table such as

- [04:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=14928) of the table such as list of users and it will appear at the

- [04:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=14931) list of users and it will appear at the bottom of the table

- [04:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=14933) bottom of the table like here you see it's a caption

- [04:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=14937) like here you see it's a caption and you can also make the caption as a

- [04:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=14940) and you can also make the caption as a top

- [04:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=14941) top this

- [04:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=14942) this so if you put caption top

- [04:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=14945) so if you put caption top the caption will appear at the top of

- [04:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=14947) the caption will appear at the top of the

- [04:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=14956) like here's and that is responsive tables

- [04:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=14958) and that is responsive tables okay responsive tables all those tables

- [04:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=14960) okay responsive tables all those tables super scrolls horizontal with ease

- [04:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=14963) super scrolls horizontal with ease make any tablet responsive across all

- [04:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=14965) make any tablet responsive across all reports by wrapping table with table

- [04:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=14968) reports by wrapping table with table responsive

- [04:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=14975) okay let's just make it responsive okay and

- [04:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=14978) okay and let's make some

- [04:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=14989) cells taking bigger space like this

- [04:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=14995) okay you see here it is already being responsive right now

- [04:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=15000) so how can we fix that

- [04:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=15003) how can we fix that i will make it responsive only if it is

- [04:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=15010) smaller than large yeah

- [04:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=15012) large yeah so it won't become responsive until the

- [04:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=15015) so it won't become responsive until the secret size

- [04:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=15017) secret size is smaller than large but it is still

- [04:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=15019) is smaller than large but it is still being responsive

- [04:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=15062) maybe ah i see

- [04:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=15069) let's make it sm so since this is bigger than sm it will

- [04:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=15071) so since this is bigger than sm it will work

- [04:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=15072) work as a responsive

- [04:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=15075) as a responsive but

- [04:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=15076) but when it becomes

- [04:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=15079) when it becomes smaller than sm there is functions in

- [04:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=15082) smaller than sm there is functions in the gun

- [04:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=15084) the gun now i see it

- [04:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=15099) um oh we already have table responsive here

- [04:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=15110) and [Music]

- [04:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=15138) okay what's the difference of examples here

- [04:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=15140) here okay so this is the tell um

- [04:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=15143) okay so this is the tell um table being responsive

- [04:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=15145) table being responsive here being responsive

- [04:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=15154) here it is also responsive so to make this one as responsive as

- [04:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=15158) so to make this one as responsive as well

- [04:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=15159) well i think we need to

- [04:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=15162) i think we need to increase size

- [04:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=15168) and the table is still not responsive

- [04:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=15190) your table is not being disposed right now because i just set it as small let's

- [04:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=15194) now because i just set it as small let's set it as large

- [04:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=15226) let's see the page source

- [04:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=15238) okay responsive large so if screen gets

- [04:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=15240) so if screen gets lower than

- [04:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=15242) lower than um

- [04:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=15243) um [Music]

- [04:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=15246) [Music] large it becomes responsive i believe

- [04:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=15258) okay 40 h and i will make it 12 th and then

- [04:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=15259) and then i will have 12

- [04:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=15263) i will have 12 okay tv here

- [04:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=15281) yeah the table is not being responsive at all

- [04:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=15308) [Music] maybe because we did set a hit like this

- [04:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=15311) maybe because we did set a hit like this but i remove it

- [04:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=15339) i see so the the uh positive have to be responsible not the table itself

- [04:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=15342) responsible not the table itself so

- [04:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=15343) so what we need to have at our parents

- [04:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=15346) what we need to have at our parents theme

- [04:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=15348) theme um

- [04:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=15349) um class equal to large responsive so if

- [04:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=15351) class equal to large responsive so if the screen size gets

- [04:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=15354) the screen size gets lower than large it will become

- [04:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=15356) lower than large it will become responsive

- [04:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=15358) responsive okay so that was our mistake

- [04:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=15368) okay you see now table is responsive here

- [04:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=15370) responsive here and it becomes responsive only when the

- [04:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=15373) and it becomes responsive only when the size is lower than

- [04:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=15375) size is lower than okay large yeah you see

- [04:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=15400) let's close this so inspect okay so this is all of it

- [04:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=15416) tables in what's up five audience

- [04:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=15418) audience tables

- [04:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=15487) okay table heads uh food

- [04:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=15499) table food captions

- [04:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=15517) okay and now figures

- [04:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=15520) and now figures so the figures are

- [04:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=15523) so the figures are almost same as images but they have your

- [04:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=15527) almost same as images but they have your caption

- [04:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=15528) caption uh like this you can set the position a

- [04:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=15532) uh like this you can set the position a line of the

- [04:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=15533) line of the uh figure caption like figure caption

- [04:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=15536) uh figure caption like figure caption text and here

- [04:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=15542) fancy so

- [04:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=15543) so let's set the figures

- [04:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=15546) let's set the figures like here the

- [04:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=15548) like here the image link here

- [04:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeTwf8xp1Y&t=15559) okay and you see we are setting figure image fluid
