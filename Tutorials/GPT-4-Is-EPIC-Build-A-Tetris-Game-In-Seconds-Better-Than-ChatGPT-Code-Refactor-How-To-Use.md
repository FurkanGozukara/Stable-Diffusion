### Video Transcription


- [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LeS7-CAr1Y&t=0) Greetings everyone. GPT-4 has been released just&nbsp; two days ago. Currently it is only available to&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LeS7-CAr1Y&t=5) ChatGPT Plus subscribers. Therefore, today I am&nbsp; going to test it thoroughly to show you what it&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LeS7-CAr1Y&t=9) is capable of. I can say that it is just amazing,&nbsp; amazingly improved when compared to ChatGPT Plus.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LeS7-CAr1Y&t=15) So to be able to use GPT-4, we are using the&nbsp; regular ChatGPT Plus interface. When you click&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LeS7-CAr1Y&t=20) the new chat, you will get option to select&nbsp; between different models. The default model&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LeS7-CAr1Y&t=24) is GPT 3.5 for Plus users. There is legacy GPT&nbsp; 3.5 version. This is for free users and GPT-4&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LeS7-CAr1Y&t=32) option. This is also available for Plus users.&nbsp; Currently GPT-4 is in beta version. Therefore,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LeS7-CAr1Y&t=37) not all of the features that it is going to have&nbsp; is included and available, but it is still awesome&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LeS7-CAr1Y&t=43) even in this version. The first question I am&nbsp; going to demonstrate is writing me a Tetris game&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LeS7-CAr1Y&t=48) that is fully working on a browser. So I have&nbsp; asked GPT-4 write me a simple Tetris game. The&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LeS7-CAr1Y&t=53) game must have score system. The game also has&nbsp; to be written purely by JavaScript and HTML5.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LeS7-CAr1Y&t=58) Also explain me how to play the game. I didn't&nbsp; touch the code that GPT-4 has generated. I only&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LeS7-CAr1Y&t=63) given the verbal commands and it fixed the code&nbsp; and make it working. The first code it provided&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LeS7-CAr1Y&t=68) me didn't work very well. Therefore, I said that&nbsp; no blocks are coming and then it apologized and&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LeS7-CAr1Y&t=73) given me corrected code. Again, I said that&nbsp; the game is still not starting. After that,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LeS7-CAr1Y&t=77) it apologized again and give me another code&nbsp; that is improved and fixed. Unfortunately,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LeS7-CAr1Y&t=82) it is still limited to 4000 characters I believe&nbsp; therefore you have to write continue to get the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LeS7-CAr1Y&t=87) remaining code. After I have written continue, it&nbsp; completed the code as you can see here and then&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LeS7-CAr1Y&t=92) I got a working code. The first basic code it has&nbsp; provided me is working like this. As you can see,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LeS7-CAr1Y&t=98) it's a simple Tetris game. It is working perfectly&nbsp; playable by using arrow keys on your keyboard.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LeS7-CAr1Y&t=103) You are able to play it. As you can see, you can&nbsp; change the position of the objects. You can rotate&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LeS7-CAr1Y&t=108) them and it is working. The code is pretty simple.&nbsp; It has a basic HTML content like this. The GPT-4&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LeS7-CAr1Y&t=114) is telling you to write this code into an HTML&nbsp; file. Then it is also giving you the JavaScript&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LeS7-CAr1Y&t=119) code like this and you are writing it to a .js&nbsp; file and giving the name of it. This is the entire&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LeS7-CAr1Y&t=125) code. The game was too simple. Therefore, I asked&nbsp; GPT-4 to add different colors to the different&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LeS7-CAr1Y&t=130) shapes and it started giving me new functions that&nbsp; are modified to have colored shapes. After back&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LeS7-CAr1Y&t=135) and forth fixing the code, giving the prompts and&nbsp; telling the GPT-4 that it is not working or this&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LeS7-CAr1Y&t=141) is wrong or this is not right. This is the final&nbsp; version of the application. As you can see now,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LeS7-CAr1Y&t=146) the shapes have colors. I also speeded up the&nbsp; game a little bit more. So the strategy is just&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LeS7-CAr1Y&t=151) telling the GPT-4 what to do, what you want to&nbsp; change and it will do that. Since it is still&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LeS7-CAr1Y&t=156) limited in the output, the number of characters&nbsp; it can provide, you are still limited to make&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LeS7-CAr1Y&t=160) a very big application. However, it is working&nbsp; very well when you work on with the individual&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LeS7-CAr1Y&t=165) functions and methods and you don't even need&nbsp; to know programming for make it work. The second&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LeS7-CAr1Y&t=170) question I asked it is what is text-to-image&nbsp; Stable Diffusion and how does it work? Explain&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LeS7-CAr1Y&t=174) for a person who doesn't have deep level technical&nbsp; knowledge. It explained me like you can see on a&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LeS7-CAr1Y&t=180) level I don't have technical knowledge. Then I&nbsp; asked the question in a different way. What is&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LeS7-CAr1Y&t=185) text-to-image stable diffusion and how does&nbsp; it work? Explain like I am 5 and this time&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LeS7-CAr1Y&t=190) it explained it to me like I am 5 and this is&nbsp; amazing. Unfortunately, the model is not very&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LeS7-CAr1Y&t=195) up to date. In their paper, they mentioned that&nbsp; they have finished the training in August 2022.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LeS7-CAr1Y&t=200) Therefore, if you are asking something that is&nbsp; newer than this, even some of the previous months,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LeS7-CAr1Y&t=205) you are not going to get a good answer. The third&nbsp; question I asked is tokenize this sentence using&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LeS7-CAr1Y&t=210) tokens like word, symbol, number, date, person and&nbsp; also add additional information to the tokens. I&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LeS7-CAr1Y&t=215) have given this sentence 1997 hello Furkan, are&nbsp; you there? And it generated me a JSON output,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LeS7-CAr1Y&t=221) tokenized it as I wanted and it is just amazing.&nbsp; Let me show you. So the tokens, type, text,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LeS7-CAr1Y&t=226) is upper, is lower, word, shape, ordinal index,&nbsp; is beginning of sentence, is end of sentence,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LeS7-CAr1Y&t=231) TFIDF score, word count, hash count in corpus.&nbsp; It used a hypothetical English corpus. Therefore,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LeS7-CAr1Y&t=237) we have TFIDF score or other things. Otherwise,&nbsp; we wouldn't have them. The fourth question is&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LeS7-CAr1Y&t=241) really good one. I said that my wife's name is&nbsp; Meryem. She loves flowers, wind, sea, sun and&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LeS7-CAr1Y&t=247) horses. Write me a very beautiful and unique poem&nbsp; that I can read to her and it has written me an&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LeS7-CAr1Y&t=252) awesome poem. As you can see right now, it is just&nbsp; amazing. If you don't have such skills like me,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LeS7-CAr1Y&t=257) you can use this tool to write awesome love&nbsp; letters or poems to your wife. As a fifth&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LeS7-CAr1Y&t=262) question, I asked something that is much harder&nbsp; to do. Write me an HTML5 app that will generate&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LeS7-CAr1Y&t=267) a flock of bird simulation. It said that creating&nbsp; a full flock of bird simulation may be too complex&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LeS7-CAr1Y&t=272) to fit within the constraints of this text-based&nbsp; response. However, I can provide you with a basic&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LeS7-CAr1Y&t=277) structure and example. So when you are working&nbsp; with GPT-4, you should first get a template,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LeS7-CAr1Y&t=282) then ask GPT-4 to fill the blanks for you. That&nbsp; way, it is able to generate much longer text,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LeS7-CAr1Y&t=289) much coherent text, much coherent response. So&nbsp; if you ask GPT-4 to give you a full solution,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LeS7-CAr1Y&t=295) it will say that it can't do that right now&nbsp; because of the size of the output. But if you&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LeS7-CAr1Y&t=300) get a layout first, then ask individual parts,&nbsp; it will complete individual parts for you. Let&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LeS7-CAr1Y&t=305) me show you the output I got. By the way, I had&nbsp; to also do some back and forth with write update&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LeS7-CAr1Y&t=310) method or other things and say continue to write&nbsp; the rest of the code. So this is the flock of bird&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LeS7-CAr1Y&t=315) animation it generated for me. So this is the code&nbsp; that GPT-4 provided me. I didn't touch anywhere.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LeS7-CAr1Y&t=321) I just given the verbal commands and it fixed&nbsp; the code. It written the missing parts of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LeS7-CAr1Y&t=326) code. Then if you don't like something with the&nbsp; code, you can command GPT-4 to modify the parts&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LeS7-CAr1Y&t=331) of that code and it will generate you a modified&nbsp; prompt. You can improve the code as you want by&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LeS7-CAr1Y&t=337) just verbally asking GPT-4 and say what to do to&nbsp; it. Then I asked a question that I couldn't solve&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LeS7-CAr1Y&t=343) in the recent time. Unfortunately, GPT-4 was also&nbsp; not able to solve this. Maybe because this is a&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LeS7-CAr1Y&t=349) recent development in the machine learning, maybe&nbsp; because it is still not capable of. I said that I&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LeS7-CAr1Y&t=354) am trying to use the below code to calculate&nbsp; similarity of given two images. The code is&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LeS7-CAr1Y&t=358) not working. Please fix it. It provides a fixed&nbsp; code, but however, it is not fixed actually. I&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LeS7-CAr1Y&t=363) asked this on Stack Overflow and I got an answer&nbsp; for this question. However, GPT-4 failed to answer&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LeS7-CAr1Y&t=369) this. So we can say that it is not still at the&nbsp; perfect level yet. Then I asked another easy one.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LeS7-CAr1Y&t=374) Write me a bash script that will read the given&nbsp; folder images and rename them randomly. You can&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LeS7-CAr1Y&t=379) use GPT-4 for such simple tasks. It will save a&nbsp; lot of time of you, but make sure that you backup&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LeS7-CAr1Y&t=384) your files first and execute the script later&nbsp; because sometimes it can give you a destructive&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LeS7-CAr1Y&t=390) code as well. I asked a translation as well said&nbsp; that translate this text into English. The text&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LeS7-CAr1Y&t=394) was written in Turkish and it translated it&nbsp; perfectly fine. This is a better translation&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LeS7-CAr1Y&t=399) than Google translate or other services. With&nbsp; translation GPT-4 is better than all of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LeS7-CAr1Y&t=404) previous versions. Then I asked the translation&nbsp; to the GPT-4 because the translation was related&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LeS7-CAr1Y&t=409) to something programming. Does the runtime of&nbsp; an experiment code using ACT-R model written in&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LeS7-CAr1Y&t=415) Python differ between Linux and Windows on the&nbsp; same hardware? The provided answer by the GPT-4&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LeS7-CAr1Y&t=420) is pretty good. So you can ask such questions&nbsp; to GPT-4 as well and improve your knowledge.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LeS7-CAr1Y&t=426) Then I asked GPT-4 how to calculate distance&nbsp; similarity measure of given two strings in .NET&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LeS7-CAr1Y&t=431) Core. Actually, this was a real question that I&nbsp; asked on Stack Overflow 11 years ago. This is the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LeS7-CAr1Y&t=436) question and you can see it was asked 11 years&nbsp; ago. The answer it provided is really, really&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LeS7-CAr1Y&t=441) good. You see, if you have a such task, then I&nbsp; don't have to search Google, search Stack Overflow&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LeS7-CAr1Y&t=445) or other websites. I can ask GPT-4 and test it out&nbsp; whether it is working or not. It is providing a&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LeS7-CAr1Y&t=451) really good code. Actually, this code is extremely&nbsp; similar to the answer given my question on Stack&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LeS7-CAr1Y&t=456) Overflow. I compared it and it is almost same&nbsp; with this answer. I have given a code and set&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LeS7-CAr1Y&t=461) GPT-4 to refactor it. Refactor the given below&nbsp; code and improve its performance in .NET Core&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LeS7-CAr1Y&t=467) C Sharp and it's giving me a refactoring code,&nbsp; but not only giving me the code, it also said&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LeS7-CAr1Y&t=472) that which parts of the code it did improve,&nbsp; combined the two initial null or empty strings&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LeS7-CAr1Y&t=477) checks into the single check, replaced 2D array&nbsp; with 1D arrays, swapped the contents of two 1D&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LeS7-CAr1Y&t=482) arrays at the end of the other loop and the rest&nbsp; of it. GPT-4 is also extremely good writing law&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LeS7-CAr1Y&t=487) text as well. I am sure you are also annoyed by&nbsp; the spam calls, robocalls, automated calls. so I&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LeS7-CAr1Y&t=493) said GPT-4 I received a spam call from some random&nbsp; guy, Inc, draft a federal lawsuit for $1,500 under&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LeS7-CAr1Y&t=500) the TCPA to sue, use the context you have learned&nbsp; from other cases and it provided me an excellent&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LeS7-CAr1Y&t=507) answer. In the beginning, it says that please&nbsp; note that I am not a lawyer and this is not&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LeS7-CAr1Y&t=510) a legal advice, consult with an attorney for any&nbsp; legal matters. The answer it provided is extremely&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LeS7-CAr1Y&t=516) good as you can see. So you can use GPT-4 to get a&nbsp; template of your law related materials. Of course,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LeS7-CAr1Y&t=523) you can't 100% trust the GPT-4, but let's&nbsp; say you are a lawyer, then you can use GPT-4&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LeS7-CAr1Y&t=529) for you to generate a template and then you&nbsp; can fix the template. So GPT-4 is extremely&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LeS7-CAr1Y&t=534) useful in professional life as well. Then I asked&nbsp; another some cool thing. I said GPT-4 convert the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LeS7-CAr1Y&t=540) following document into a presentation, pasted&nbsp; the text, entire text. Actually, it is a pretty&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LeS7-CAr1Y&t=545) long text. Then it turned the document into a&nbsp; presentation and it is awesome. It is fantastic.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LeS7-CAr1Y&t=550) Slide one title, subtitle, slide two title&nbsp; and the text, slide three title and the text,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LeS7-CAr1Y&t=555) slide four title and the text. It doesn't provide&nbsp; you the entire slides. So therefore you need to&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LeS7-CAr1Y&t=560) type continue. Then it continues to writing slide&nbsp; six, slide seven, slide eight. I think when it&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LeS7-CAr1Y&t=565) is released in full version, it will be able to&nbsp; generate much longer text because in the website&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LeS7-CAr1Y&t=570) of OpenAI GPT-4 has a context length of 8,000&nbsp; tokens. We are also providing limited access to&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LeS7-CAr1Y&t=577) our 32,000 tokens context, about 50 pages of text&nbsp; of GPT-4, as you can see here. So it is going to&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LeS7-CAr1Y&t=584) support much bigger responses, much bigger input.&nbsp; It is also going to support image input. However,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LeS7-CAr1Y&t=589) it is not currently available in the interface.&nbsp; So you will be able to give a visual input and&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LeS7-CAr1Y&t=595) then GPT-4 will be able to process that image&nbsp; and give you the results. So you will be able&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LeS7-CAr1Y&t=600) to give an input image and ask questions about&nbsp; it, such as what is unusual about this image and&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LeS7-CAr1Y&t=605) GPT-4 will tell you the unusual thing about this&nbsp; image is that man is ironing clothes on an ironing&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LeS7-CAr1Y&t=611) board attached to the roof of a moving taxi. It&nbsp; is just amazing. I wanted to further push GPT-4&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LeS7-CAr1Y&t=616) and see what it is capable of. So I said that&nbsp; generate SVG code that will draw a battle scene&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LeS7-CAr1Y&t=622) from a human fighter fighting against a futuristic&nbsp; robot and guess what it did produce. So this is&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LeS7-CAr1Y&t=626) the first image it has generated. We can see that&nbsp; there is a human here, a battle robot here. It's&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LeS7-CAr1Y&t=631) a very simple fighting scene, but it was able to&nbsp; generate this purely from text prompt. It is just&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LeS7-CAr1Y&t=637) amazing. Then I said that can you make human and&nbsp; robot character bigger size? You see that I had a&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LeS7-CAr1Y&t=642) typo here, but still it was able to understand the&nbsp; commands perfectly well. And this is the second&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LeS7-CAr1Y&t=646) image it generated. It made them bigger size as&nbsp; I have instructed to the GPT-4. This was all for&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LeS7-CAr1Y&t=652) today. If you have enjoyed, please like subscribe,&nbsp; leave a comment and tell me what you are thinking.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LeS7-CAr1Y&t=657) I believe that in the future GPT will be much more&nbsp; useful for professional using. It will be much&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LeS7-CAr1Y&t=663) more capable to do more things. It will make our&nbsp; jobs easier. If you also support me on Patreon, I&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LeS7-CAr1Y&t=668) would appreciate that very much. You can find the&nbsp; Patreon link here. Thank you so much for watching&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LeS7-CAr1Y&t=672) and leaving a comment. And I am going to hopefully&nbsp; release a new video regarding how to teach a style&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LeS7-CAr1Y&t=679) at the level of Midjourney for free for Stable&nbsp; Diffusion. Stay tuned. Hopefully see you later.
