### Video Transcription


- [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXBiqJOc9FE&t=0) The interesting question is, just because&nbsp; something thinks differently from you,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXBiqJOc9FE&t=4) does that mean it's not thinking? Only audio&nbsp; input and a fully talking video avatar. We&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXBiqJOc9FE&t=11) allow for humans to have such divergences from&nbsp; one another. You like strawberries, I hate ice&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXBiqJOc9FE&t=17) skating, you cry at sad films, I am allergic to&nbsp; pollen. What is the point of different tastes,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXBiqJOc9FE&t=25) different preferences if not to say that&nbsp; our brains work differently, that we think&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXBiqJOc9FE&t=32) differently? And you can also provide a driving&nbsp; video and generate even better talking avatars.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXBiqJOc9FE&t=38) So today I am going to show you how to use this&nbsp; amazing newest V-Express open source application&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXBiqJOc9FE&t=46) on cloud services if you don't have a powerful&nbsp; GPU. If you are following me, I already have&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXBiqJOc9FE&t=52) published the Windows tutorial that is running&nbsp; on your local computer. So if you have a powerful&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXBiqJOc9FE&t=58) GPU, you can already use this application on&nbsp; Windows with one-click installers; moreover,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXBiqJOc9FE&t=64) you still should watch the Windows tutorial&nbsp; because I explain in more details how to use this&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXBiqJOc9FE&t=69) application on Windows tutorial. So today I am&nbsp; going to show you how to one-click install and use&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXBiqJOc9FE&t=75) this application on Massed Compute with an amazing&nbsp; price: 31 cents per hour on a very powerful GPU&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXBiqJOc9FE&t=82) RTX A6000. You see it is running on the Massed&nbsp; Compute. And it is even able to generate 1-minute&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXBiqJOc9FE&t=89) long videos. Moreover, I am also going to show&nbsp; you how to install and use on RunPod machines.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXBiqJOc9FE&t=96) You see I am running on three instances on RunPod&nbsp; to generate multiple videos at once. Furthermore,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXBiqJOc9FE&t=103) if you don't want to pay to the cloud services,&nbsp; I also prepared a free Kaggle account notebook.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXBiqJOc9FE&t=110) So I will show you how to use this application on&nbsp; a free Kaggle account as well. Also, I have done&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXBiqJOc9FE&t=116) more tests on the cloud services, and I am sharing&nbsp; the test results and their configuration. So you&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXBiqJOc9FE&t=123) can download the test file and look at each one&nbsp; of the results and their configuration and decide&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXBiqJOc9FE&t=128) which one is working best for you. Moreover,&nbsp; I have prepared more demo input images and&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXBiqJOc9FE&t=134) input videos so you can easily test the different&nbsp; configuration on these files as well. And finally,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXBiqJOc9FE&t=142) I have updated this Patreon post, added some new&nbsp; information and the new links. So everything we&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXBiqJOc9FE&t=149) need is shared in this post. The link of this&nbsp; post will be in the description of the video.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXBiqJOc9FE&t=155) Please read this post then go to the very bottom&nbsp; of the post and you will see the installer's zip&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXBiqJOc9FE&t=160) file which is V-Express installer's version 4.&nbsp; Let's just download it. Then let's extract it&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXBiqJOc9FE&t=166) into our downloads folder. Enter inside the&nbsp; extraction folder and you will see all of&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXBiqJOc9FE&t=173) the files here. I will begin with installing on&nbsp; Massed Compute which is my newest favorite cloud&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXBiqJOc9FE&t=180) service provider. To install on Massed Compute&nbsp; just double-click the Massed Compute instructions&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXBiqJOc9FE&t=185) read txt file. And all of the instructions are&nbsp; here. First of all, please register your Massed&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXBiqJOc9FE&t=191) Compute account or log in by double-clicking this&nbsp; link. After you did that, go to the billing and&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXBiqJOc9FE&t=197) set your credits from here. Then we will deploy&nbsp; a machine. So in this interface, we are going to&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXBiqJOc9FE&t=204) select A6000 GPU. You see RTX A6000. Why? Because&nbsp; we have a special coupon for this GPU and this GPU&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXBiqJOc9FE&t=212) is very powerful. It has 48 gigabytes VRAM. Then&nbsp; from the category select creator and from image&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXBiqJOc9FE&t=217) select SECourses. This is our virtual machine.&nbsp; This is mandatory to select and to get half price&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXBiqJOc9FE&t=223) you see currently it is 62 cents per hour. Type&nbsp; here SECourses like this and click verify and&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXBiqJOc9FE&t=229) you see now the price is 31 cents per hour. This&nbsp; deal is amazing for this GPU. Moreover, we get 48&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXBiqJOc9FE&t=237) gigabytes RAM. And 256 gigabytes hard drive. For&nbsp; this machine, click deploy. Once you click deploy,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXBiqJOc9FE&t=245) just wait for the machine to be initialized. You&nbsp; see this is the new one that we have initialized.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXBiqJOc9FE&t=250) I also have another running instance right now.&nbsp; And let's delete the previously running instance.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXBiqJOc9FE&t=256) You see there is a delete button. Once you delete&nbsp; the instance, all of the data will be lost. Pay&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXBiqJOc9FE&t=260) attention to that. Let's terminate. And meanwhile,&nbsp; this virtual machine is getting initialized. Let's&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXBiqJOc9FE&t=266) also install the ThinLinc client if you haven't&nbsp; yet. You see there is a ThinLinc client here&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXBiqJOc9FE&t=271) link. I click it this arrow to open here. And when&nbsp; you go to the ThinLinc client downloads, download&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXBiqJOc9FE&t=277) according to your computer. If you are using Mac,&nbsp; download the Mac version. If you are using Linux,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXBiqJOc9FE&t=283) download the Linux version. I am on Windows, so I&nbsp; am going to download Windows. Open the downloaded&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXBiqJOc9FE&t=289) .exe file. It will ask you permission. Click yes.&nbsp; Installation is so easy. Just click yes. Next,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXBiqJOc9FE&t=296) install. And then run ThinLinc client. Finish.&nbsp; So we are ready to use. However, before using it,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXBiqJOc9FE&t=302) set up your synchronization driver. You see&nbsp; there are options and advanced. If you don't&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXBiqJOc9FE&t=308) see options, click the advanced button here.&nbsp; Click options. Go to the local devices. Uncheck&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXBiqJOc9FE&t=315) all of the checkboxes and just check the drives.&nbsp; And click details. You should add a new folder&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXBiqJOc9FE&t=321) for synchronization. I am going to add my folder.&nbsp; So I will remove and add again. Click this three&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXBiqJOc9FE&t=328) dots icon. Select the folder where you want files&nbsp; to be synchronized with the cloud machine or with&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXBiqJOc9FE&t=336) your computer. So I am going to select this Mass&nbsp; Compute folder on my hard drive. Click OK. If you&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXBiqJOc9FE&t=343) want it read-only, you can make it read-only. So&nbsp; you will be able to read these files, your local&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXBiqJOc9FE&t=348) files from the cloud machine. But if you also&nbsp; want to synchronize, I suggest you read and write&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXBiqJOc9FE&t=355) and click OK and click. OK. Then just wait for&nbsp; initialization to be completed. And the machine&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXBiqJOc9FE&t=361) is initialized within like two minutes, maybe&nbsp; less. Then copy this login IP. Go back to ThinLinc&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXBiqJOc9FE&t=367) client and paste it. You see I just copy-paste the&nbsp; IP. Then the username is Ubuntu and Ubuntu these&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXBiqJOc9FE&t=373) usernames have to match. Then click this copy. It&nbsp; will copy the password and paste it and connect.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXBiqJOc9FE&t=379) Then it will ask you this screen. Click continue.&nbsp; Then you will get to this screen. Click start.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXBiqJOc9FE&t=386) Just wait. This part, it is very quick and we will&nbsp; in a minute access the computer and yes. So our&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXBiqJOc9FE&t=393) virtual machine has started. This virtual machine&nbsp; is extremely special. It comes with Automatic1111&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXBiqJOc9FE&t=400) web UI. It comes with SD Forge. It comes with one&nbsp; trainer, Kohya. There is also one click updater&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXBiqJOc9FE&t=407) scripts for them. Moreover, this machine comes&nbsp; with Python 3.10.12 and git and CUDA 11.8. So you&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXBiqJOc9FE&t=416) can use this virtual machine for any AI task. It&nbsp; should work on this machine. So how are we going&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXBiqJOc9FE&t=423) to install the V-Express on this machine? To&nbsp; install it, copy these extracted files. Go to&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXBiqJOc9FE&t=430) your synchronization folder, which was my Mass&nbsp; Compute folder. Here. I am going to make a new&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXBiqJOc9FE&t=437) folder here and let's say V-Express version 4 like&nbsp; this. You can also extract into this folder and&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXBiqJOc9FE&t=444) just copy paste it. Then go back to ThinLinc.com.&nbsp; When you get this software updater message, just&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXBiqJOc9FE&t=450) click cancel and where these files are copied. Go&nbsp; to the home button here. Inside this home button,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXBiqJOc9FE&t=457) scroll down and you will see thindrives. Enter&nbsp; inside it. So this is where our files will be&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXBiqJOc9FE&t=464) synchronized. So you see this is my local folder&nbsp; name. Enter inside it. Using it is very easy. Just&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXBiqJOc9FE&t=471) after using one time, you will know how to use.&nbsp; So you see this was my folder. Just drag and drop&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXBiqJOc9FE&t=477) it for copying into desktop. You shouldn't&nbsp; install into this synchronization folder.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXBiqJOc9FE&t=482) It will not work. So it is copied to the right&nbsp; bottom of the screen. So I just drag it and drop&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXBiqJOc9FE&t=488) it to the here so you can see. Enter inside the&nbsp; folder. So this is where we are going to install:&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXBiqJOc9FE&t=494) home &gt; desktop &gt; V-Express version 4. And inside&nbsp; this folder, double click and open the Massed&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXBiqJOc9FE&t=501) Compute instructions and copy this command. This&nbsp; is the installation command. All of my scripts&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXBiqJOc9FE&t=507) have the same logic. Then click this three dots&nbsp; icon and click open terminal. So we have started&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXBiqJOc9FE&t=514) the terminal inside this folder. Then copy paste&nbsp; the command. So let's copy the command one more&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXBiqJOc9FE&t=520) time. Sometimes copy paste may not work. With&nbsp; Ctrl-c I copy. Then right click and paste. Okay,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXBiqJOc9FE&t=525) we didn't copy it accurately. Let's copy one more&nbsp; time. So copy Ctrl-c. Right click and paste. And&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXBiqJOc9FE&t=533) then it will start installation. You don't need&nbsp; to do anything else. It will install everything&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXBiqJOc9FE&t=537) all of the models and then we will run it with&nbsp; one-click. Okay, so the installation has been&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXBiqJOc9FE&t=542) completed. How are we going to start it? Let's&nbsp; return back to instructions txt file and just&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXBiqJOc9FE&t=549) copy this command with Ctrl-c. You see I write&nbsp; everything for you. Then click this three dots&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXBiqJOc9FE&t=555) icon one more time and open another terminal. You&nbsp; can also use this terminal. It should work and&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXBiqJOc9FE&t=561) paste it and hit enter. So I am showing this way.&nbsp; So you can also restart it if you want to restart&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXBiqJOc9FE&t=568) just close this terminal and open again and&nbsp; execute the command and it will work. So we got&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXBiqJOc9FE&t=573) both local URL and also Gradio live share. So you&nbsp; can use both of them. If you open this link with&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXBiqJOc9FE&t=580) right click and open link you can use it locally&nbsp; or you can use it from the Gradio live as well.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXBiqJOc9FE&t=585) So I am going to show you how to use Gradio live.&nbsp; I will copy this link and I will return back to&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXBiqJOc9FE&t=590) my own computer and paste it and I will be using&nbsp; this link from my computer. You can use it from&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXBiqJOc9FE&t=596) your phone, mobile phone, your tablet wherever you&nbsp; want and I will be able to use this application&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXBiqJOc9FE&t=603) that is running on Massed Compute. I have prepared&nbsp; two demo images and videos. You can download both&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXBiqJOc9FE&t=610) of them and extract them to use. You can put&nbsp; them into your synchronization folder. However,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXBiqJOc9FE&t=616) I will be using them from this Gradio. So just&nbsp; click here to upload the image. So these are the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXBiqJOc9FE&t=622) demo images and videos part two. Select this one.&nbsp; I will make a quick demo because you should watch&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXBiqJOc9FE&t=628) the Windows tutorial of this application. In the&nbsp; Windows tutorial, I have explained everything.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXBiqJOc9FE&t=634) You see this is the Windows tutorial. It is on&nbsp; our channel. I will also put the link of this&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXBiqJOc9FE&t=639) video into the description of the video so you&nbsp; can quickly find it and learn how to use this&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXBiqJOc9FE&t=644) application. Then let's select the video file.&nbsp; You can also use audios. You don't need video.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXBiqJOc9FE&t=649) Both of them work. So let's select this one. So&nbsp; this is a two second clip. I prepared all times&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXBiqJOc9FE&t=656) of clips so you can use them, try them. Just click&nbsp; play. So this is our driving clip and this is our&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXBiqJOc9FE&t=663) driving image. I am going to use offset retarget.&nbsp; This is the best working one. If you get too&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXBiqJOc9FE&t=669) much problem with the mouth movements, you can&nbsp; reduce the audio attention weight. For example,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXBiqJOc9FE&t=674) let's make this two and this will increase the&nbsp; likeliness of the output image. I am still testing&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXBiqJOc9FE&t=681) them and they will be included in the tests file&nbsp; that I have shown you and auto crop is enabled so&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXBiqJOc9FE&t=687) it will automatically crop this. The target video&nbsp; width and height are set. You should watch the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXBiqJOc9FE&t=691) Windows tutorial. Then just click the generate&nbsp; talking video. To see the entire process you&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXBiqJOc9FE&t=696) should return back to the CMD window command line&nbsp; interface where you have started the application.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXBiqJOc9FE&t=702) We started it on Massed Compute. You see it is&nbsp; super fast to detect the faces because I have&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXBiqJOc9FE&t=708) prepared everything accurately with the accurate&nbsp; libraries. This is running on a cloud machine not&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXBiqJOc9FE&t=713) on my machine. This machine has a huge amount&nbsp; of VRAM, an amazing configuration let me show&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXBiqJOc9FE&t=720) you. So I opened another window and nvitop is the&nbsp; command. You see we have 48 GB VRAM memory here.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXBiqJOc9FE&t=728) We will see how much it will use for this video.&nbsp; Another advantage of Massed Compute is that you&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXBiqJOc9FE&t=734) can generate even very long duration videos&nbsp; because it has 48 GB VRAM. So it is starting&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXBiqJOc9FE&t=740) inference on our CMD window. We can watch the&nbsp; status here. Okay, the inference video generation&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXBiqJOc9FE&t=747) started so it is taking around 4.5 seconds per&nbsp; IT and it will be completed in 30 iterations.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXBiqJOc9FE&t=755) Why? Because our step count is set as 30 so it&nbsp; will take 30 iterations to be completed. As you&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXBiqJOc9FE&t=761) increase the number of frames of your target&nbsp; video or the duration of your target audio,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXBiqJOc9FE&t=767) it will use more VRAM memory. It is not exactly as&nbsp; linear but it is getting more used. Actually after&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXBiqJOc9FE&t=774) this video I will put a one minute video&nbsp; here to show you. Okay, the result video&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXBiqJOc9FE&t=779) is generated. Let's play. Machine is different.&nbsp; Machine is different. Machine is different.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXBiqJOc9FE&t=784) Machine is different. Machine is different.&nbsp; Machine is different. Okay, so we see the input&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXBiqJOc9FE&t=789) and output. And where is this file saved and how&nbsp; you are going to download it? Let's return back to&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXBiqJOc9FE&t=795) the Massed Compute. On Massed Compute since this&nbsp; is a desktop interface you can click open outputs&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXBiqJOc9FE&t=801) folder and it will open the outputs folder.&nbsp; So it is saved inside our installation folder&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXBiqJOc9FE&t=806) inside outputs. So how can you download all of the&nbsp; generated videos into your computer? Go back to&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXBiqJOc9FE&t=812) the parent folder. Right click outputs and copy.&nbsp; Then return back to the home. In the thindrives&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXBiqJOc9FE&t=819) this is where our synchronization mass compute.&nbsp; You can also upload your Google drive, OneDrive&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXBiqJOc9FE&t=824) wherever you want and paste it there. After I&nbsp; do that when I return back to my synchronization&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXBiqJOc9FE&t=830) folder on my computer it will be there. Let's&nbsp; return back to our synchronization folder. And you&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXBiqJOc9FE&t=836) see output has arrived here and now this is on my&nbsp; computer. So it is synchronized. Just open it and&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXBiqJOc9FE&t=843) you will see it there. So one more thing before&nbsp; I end the tutorial for the Massed Compute. Then&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXBiqJOc9FE&t=849) we will move to the RunPod. Let's try 1-minute&nbsp; length video. So this is our current VRAM usage&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXBiqJOc9FE&t=856) only 33 megabytes. And let's go to here and just&nbsp; upload a one minute video. It is also inside this&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXBiqJOc9FE&t=863) example benedict 60 seconds. So let's upload it&nbsp; into our Gradio live interface. Then hit generate&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXBiqJOc9FE&t=871) talking video. By the way, you can also generate&nbsp; higher resolution videos from here. Target video&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXBiqJOc9FE&t=876) width and target video height. If you change them&nbsp; make sure that to change the crop width and crop&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXBiqJOc9FE&t=882) height as well if you are using auto crop image&nbsp; and let's see how much VRAM we will use with 1&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXBiqJOc9FE&t=889) minute video. So it is extracting faces in all of&nbsp; the frames and you see there are so many frames&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXBiqJOc9FE&t=895) in this video. So the inference has started. It&nbsp; is using 40 GB VRAM for 1819 frames video. So it&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXBiqJOc9FE&t=905) is a one minute video and it is using 40 GB and&nbsp; it is not a problem because we are renting this&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXBiqJOc9FE&t=911) machine with only 31 cents per hour as you are&nbsp; seeing. Let's say you need even longer videos or&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXBiqJOc9FE&t=918) bigger resolution than in the deployment menu you&nbsp; can rent A100 GPU. You see it is 80 gigabyte and&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXBiqJOc9FE&t=926) if you rent that one you will be able to generate&nbsp; even longer and bigger resolution videos. So it is&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXBiqJOc9FE&t=933) time to install on RunPod. To install on RunPod we&nbsp; have RunPod instructions read txt file inside the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXBiqJOc9FE&t=941) downloaded zip file. So just open it. Then first&nbsp; register or login your RunPod account. I have a&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXBiqJOc9FE&t=947) link here. Please use that. So let's login.&nbsp; If you don't have an account. Just register&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXBiqJOc9FE&t=952) and in here click pods. You see I already have&nbsp; two running pods which I am running the tests&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXBiqJOc9FE&t=959) for you so you will be able to see which each&nbsp; configuration makes then click deploy and in&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXBiqJOc9FE&t=966) this screen the selections are super important.&nbsp; I'm going to use community cloud because it is&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXBiqJOc9FE&t=971) cheaper and I am going to set the extreme speed so&nbsp; it will download faster. Now minimum use 3090 24&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXBiqJOc9FE&t=980) gigabyte. You can also use RTX A6000, A40, or RTX&nbsp; A5000. These are all usable graphic cards or the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXBiqJOc9FE&t=990) above ones from here. For this tutorial, I will&nbsp; use RTX 4090, which is the fastest GPU. However,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXBiqJOc9FE&t=997) if you are going to generate longer videos, you&nbsp; may get an out of VRAM error. Now, this template&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXBiqJOc9FE&t=1001) selection is super important. You see, after I&nbsp; selected GPU, I need to select my template here.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXBiqJOc9FE&t=1007) Click change template and type PyTorch. Now I am&nbsp; going to change it. I am going to change it. After&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXBiqJOc9FE&t=1011) you typed PyTorch, you will get all of these&nbsp; official templates. From these PyTorch templates,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXBiqJOc9FE&t=1016) you need to select this PyTorch 2.1. Why? Because&nbsp; this template has CUDA 11.8, which is mandatory&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXBiqJOc9FE&t=1024) to run it faster. So select PyTorch 2.1. This is&nbsp; already written in the instructions, so you should&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXBiqJOc9FE&t=1031) always read my instructions for my scripts and&nbsp; then click back again the edit template. Set the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXBiqJOc9FE&t=1037) volume disk like 50 gigabytes; it is sufficient.&nbsp; Also, if you want to use RunPod proxy connection,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXBiqJOc9FE&t=1043) set a HTTP port here, 7861, and Set Overrides.&nbsp; Then go to the bottom and deploy on demand.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXBiqJOc9FE&t=1051) Let's go to my pods. So this is the new pod that&nbsp; I am starting, let's say tutorial from here, and&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXBiqJOc9FE&t=1057) submit. And the pod connect button appeared; click&nbsp; connect. Connect to the Jupyter lab. This screen&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXBiqJOc9FE&t=1063) may not appear or start immediately; it depends on&nbsp; your pod. Now from here, click this icon. We will&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXBiqJOc9FE&t=1069) upload the downloaded zip files. So select the&nbsp; extracted zip file and upload everything there.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXBiqJOc9FE&t=1076) You see, I have uploaded everything. Double click&nbsp; RunPod instructions read txt file. And this is&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXBiqJOc9FE&t=1082) the installation command. Copy it. Click this plus&nbsp; icon. A new terminal here. Paste it. This is all.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXBiqJOc9FE&t=1088) It will install everything automatically for us.&nbsp; All of my scripts are working with the same logic.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXBiqJOc9FE&t=1093) So once you learn how to run one of them, you can&nbsp; run all of them. Just follow the instructions.&nbsp;So&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXBiqJOc9FE&t=1099) the installation has been completed. Let's&nbsp; return back to the instructions file.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXBiqJOc9FE&t=1103) Select this part. And open a new terminal. Just&nbsp; copy-paste it. This will start the application.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXBiqJOc9FE&t=1109) It will also give us a Gradio live share&nbsp; because we use the share command. You see,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXBiqJOc9FE&t=1114) we can connect from Gradio live. And also, you&nbsp; can connect from the HTTP service port 7861&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXBiqJOc9FE&t=1122) because it starts on that port by default.&nbsp; So you can use either way. For this one,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXBiqJOc9FE&t=1127) I will do a quick test. So let's select&nbsp; the example files. So let's pick this one,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXBiqJOc9FE&t=1133) for example. And let's use a 7-second video file.&nbsp; I am going to use offset retarget. And let's make&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXBiqJOc9FE&t=1140) the audio attention weight 2. And let's make the&nbsp; reference attention weight 1. Just wait for files&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXBiqJOc9FE&t=1146) to be completely uploaded. Once it is done,&nbsp; click generate talking video. I will also update&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXBiqJOc9FE&t=1153) this application and add a windows tutorial&nbsp; link. And let's see the speed on 4090. So,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXBiqJOc9FE&t=1159) it is first processing the frames. We have 233&nbsp; frames for this video. So the inference has&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXBiqJOc9FE&t=1166) started. It is taking 11 seconds per it for 233&nbsp; frames video. It is about a 7-second video. This&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXBiqJOc9FE&t=1176) is the speed of RTX 4090. So it is taking around&nbsp; 5 minutes to generate a 7-second video on RTX&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXBiqJOc9FE&t=1184) 4090. It is not very fast but it is not very slow&nbsp; either. So the video on RunPod has been generated.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXBiqJOc9FE&t=1191) Let's play it. The interesting question is just&nbsp; because something thinks differently from you,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXBiqJOc9FE&t=1197) does that mean it's not thinking? Okay, it&nbsp; is decent. So how you can download all of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXBiqJOc9FE&t=1203) generated videos on RunPod. Go to the V-Express&nbsp; folder. It is inside the workspace. In here,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXBiqJOc9FE&t=1210) you will see outputs. Right-click and download as&nbsp; an archive. This is the easiest way. And you see,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXBiqJOc9FE&t=1215) it is downloaded. Alternatively, you can use&nbsp; RunPodctl to download all of them. Watch this&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXBiqJOc9FE&t=1222) amazing tutorial to learn how to use RunPodctl on&nbsp; your computer. It is also an alternative way of&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXBiqJOc9FE&t=1228) downloading. One another thing is that you can use&nbsp; Hugging Face uploading. In this amazing tutorial&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXBiqJOc9FE&t=1235) video, I have shown how to download and upload&nbsp; files and folders to the Hugging Face. So you&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXBiqJOc9FE&t=1241) can watch this amazing tutorial to learn that as&nbsp; well. Now, the final thing is that using Kaggle.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXBiqJOc9FE&t=1248) To use Kaggle, go to Kaggle.com. This is the&nbsp; slowest way, but it is completely free. Login&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXBiqJOc9FE&t=1255) with your account and activate your phone number.&nbsp; Then click this create button. Click new notebook.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXBiqJOc9FE&t=1262) In this interface, select the accelerator from&nbsp; here as GPU P100. GPU P100 has more VRAM than the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXBiqJOc9FE&t=1272) GPU T4. That is why we are using it. Then go to&nbsp; the file. Click import notebook. Drag and drop or&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXBiqJOc9FE&t=1279) select the notebook file. Click browse files. Go&nbsp; to the inside of your downloaded folder, you see,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXBiqJOc9FE&t=1286) and select the free Kaggle notebook. Then once you&nbsp; have selected the notebook, click import. And you&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXBiqJOc9FE&t=1291) will get to this screen. On this screen, you will&nbsp; get settings updated. Click OK. It is fine. If&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXBiqJOc9FE&t=1297) you don't get it, it is also fine. Then click this&nbsp; start session. Wait for the session to be started.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXBiqJOc9FE&t=1303) If you are not able to select the accelerator,&nbsp; that means your account is not phone. Then make&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXBiqJOc9FE&t=1308) sure that the internet on is selected here. Wait&nbsp; for the kernel to be started. Once you get this&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXBiqJOc9FE&t=1315) green icon, click here, and you will see your&nbsp; session with GPU 100 and the RAM and the memory&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXBiqJOc9FE&t=1322) used. Then click this play icon; it will install&nbsp; everything automatically for you. You don't need&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXBiqJOc9FE&t=1328) to do anything else. Just wait patiently. If you&nbsp; scroll down, you will see the installation logs&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXBiqJOc9FE&t=1334) like this. If it gets broken. Just message me from&nbsp; Patreon, and hopefully, I will fix it immediately.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXBiqJOc9FE&t=1340) Once the Kaggle installation has been completed,&nbsp; you will see that this cancel button disappeared.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXBiqJOc9FE&t=1346) So the installation has been completed. You see&nbsp; there is no more cancel button. In the below,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXBiqJOc9FE&t=1352) there are several steps that you have to follow to&nbsp; use the web UI on Kaggle. Unfortunately, it is not&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXBiqJOc9FE&t=1359) as just Gradio share. It is blocked. So read the&nbsp; instructions and apply them. And as a next step,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXBiqJOc9FE&t=1367) we are going to execute this cell; let me show&nbsp; you. So once you have applied the above steps,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXBiqJOc9FE&t=1372) there is also a tutorial that is showing you how&nbsp; to do that. A video tutorial. All you need to do&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXBiqJOc9FE&t=1378) is just click this cell. So I click this cell.&nbsp; Just wait for the local URL to be started. Okay,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXBiqJOc9FE&t=1385) running on the local URL started. Now visit the&nbsp; link that you got in the above after following the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXBiqJOc9FE&t=1391) instructions. And there you will see visit&nbsp; site. After you click it, visit the site;&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXBiqJOc9FE&t=1396) you will get our interface. On Kaggle, we&nbsp; have limited VRAM, so I am going to test&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXBiqJOc9FE&t=1402) with a smaller video. Let's select our image.&nbsp; I am going to use this one. And I am going to&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXBiqJOc9FE&t=1408) select a smaller video, Benedict 2 seconds like&nbsp; this. Let's select the offset retarget, and let's&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXBiqJOc9FE&t=1415) make both attentions 1. I think this is working&nbsp; best. And click generate talking video. Then when&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXBiqJOc9FE&t=1421) you return back to your Kaggle. You will see how&nbsp; it is working. It will process everything. So this&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXBiqJOc9FE&t=1427) video is 61 frames. So the inference has started,&nbsp; and it is using 12.3 gigabytes of VRAM for 61&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXBiqJOc9FE&t=1435) frames video. You probably can go to 2-3 minutes,&nbsp; maybe 4-5 minutes video input. But after that,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXBiqJOc9FE&t=1443) you may get out of VRAM error. So you should&nbsp; use the Massed Compute instructions, and you&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXBiqJOc9FE&t=1449) can then generate even 1-minute videos or even&nbsp; longer. So our video is generated is generated on&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXBiqJOc9FE&t=1456) Kaggle as well. How you can download all of the&nbsp; generated images on Kaggle. Return back to the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXBiqJOc9FE&t=1462) Kaggle notebook, and to download all of them, we&nbsp; are going to hit the cancel run button because we&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXBiqJOc9FE&t=1468) are going to execute this cell. So let's hit&nbsp; the cancel run button. Then click this cell.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXBiqJOc9FE&t=1474) This cell is going to zip all of the video files&nbsp; into the working directory. So on the right panel,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXBiqJOc9FE&t=1482) click here. And you see now we have a videos.zip&nbsp; file. Whenever you click this cell, it will re-zip&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXBiqJOc9FE&t=1489) all of the videos. Then from this three dots icon&nbsp; here, click and click download. And this way,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXBiqJOc9FE&t=1496) you can zip and download all of the videos that&nbsp; you have generated on a Kaggle account. And also,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXBiqJOc9FE&t=1504) you can of course click this download icon here&nbsp; and download videos directly to your computer.&nbsp;&nbsp;
