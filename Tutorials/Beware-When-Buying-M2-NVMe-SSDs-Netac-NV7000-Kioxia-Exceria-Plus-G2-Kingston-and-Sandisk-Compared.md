### Video Transcription


- [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTgd8lU9EJw&t=0) Greetings, everyone. In this video, I am going to show you 4 SSD M.2 disks that I am using in

- [00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTgd8lU9EJw&t=6) my daily life for AI tasks. I am going to compare their speed and I am going to make benchmarks and

- [00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTgd8lU9EJw&t=14) experimentation with them. The first disk that I am going to show you is Netac NVMe SSD 2TB.

- [00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTgd8lU9EJw&t=22) It is my system drive so it will be a little bit slower. Also, it is running on PCI X4 8000 MB per

- [00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTgd8lU9EJw&t=29) second. The second disk is Kioxia Exceria Plus G2 SSD 2TB. This is my newest disk that I have

- [00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTgd8lU9EJw&t=38) just purchased. You see it has been used only 53 hours so far. These are its features. It is

- [00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTgd8lU9EJw&t=45) running on PCI Express 4X slot but I don't know why it is 4000 MB per second. The third disk that

- [00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTgd8lU9EJw&t=53) I am going to compare and benchmark is Kingston SNVS2000G drive. It is also running on PCI Express

- [00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTgd8lU9EJw&t=63) 4X slot and it is 8000 MB per second. And the last disk that I am going to test and benchmark

- [00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTgd8lU9EJw&t=69) is SanDisk Ultra 3D NVMe 1TB disk. Even though it is running on this PCI Express M.2 expansion card,

- [00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTgd8lU9EJw&t=78) it is running with also PCI Express 4X link so it is 4000 MB per second as well. During the tests,

- [00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTgd8lU9EJw&t=86) the M.2 disks will get hot so to be ensured that there are no throttling due to heating, I am going

- [00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTgd8lU9EJw&t=93) to temporarily cool them down with this way as you are seeing right now. So you may wonder why

- [00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTgd8lU9EJw&t=98) I need so many disks. I am doing a lot of AI stuff and I am going to use this newest disk as a cache

- [00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTgd8lU9EJw&t=105) folder for Hugging Face AI models. But you can use them for any reason. Also, please subscribe to our

- [00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTgd8lU9EJw&t=112) channel and join our Discord channel. The links will be in the description of the video. My CPU

- [00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTgd8lU9EJw&t=118) is 13900K. My motherboard is Gigabyte Z690 UD. I have submitted my disk information to the CPU-Z

- [00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTgd8lU9EJw&t=128) validator and the link of this validator will be in the description of the video if you want

- [00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTgd8lU9EJw&t=132) to check it out later. So for testing, I am going to use CrystalDiskMark the latest version 8.0.4.

- [00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTgd8lU9EJw&t=139) I will do the 1GB default testing and I will also do 16GB testing. Moreover, I am going to use this

- [00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTgd8lU9EJw&t=147) Python file to generate a file with 150GB size so we will see their performance when writing

- [00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTgd8lU9EJw&t=155) very big files. Because after a while the cache of these M.2 disks gets filled up and their speed

- [00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTgd8lU9EJw&t=163) decreases significantly so we will see them how they are performing. Okay, let's begin with our

- [00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTgd8lU9EJw&t=169) first drive C drive. I will do three times testing all tests. Currently, the disk is 53 Celsius

- [00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTgd8lU9EJw&t=177) temperature because there is one big GPU running in my case. The read speed is amazing. Meanwhile,

- [00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTgd8lU9EJw&t=183) I am recording a video. Let's also see the speed in the task manager. Alright, here we can see.

- [00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTgd8lU9EJw&t=191) Okay, read speed is also displayed here currently it is doing the slower test. 3.3GB read speed

- [00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTgd8lU9EJw&t=198) we can see. We can definitely get the values that we should get. During the reading tests,

- [00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTgd8lU9EJw&t=204) the temperature is not rising. You see, almost same but when writing, it is getting really hot.

- [00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTgd8lU9EJw&t=210) However, since I am using this technique, it should not get very hot to throttle the disk.

- [00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTgd8lU9EJw&t=217) Okay, the tests have been completed. Even though this is a system disk even though it is very much

- [00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTgd8lU9EJw&t=223) full, you see it is almost matching the on-sheet speeds. 7000MB per second on the sheet speed is

- [00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTgd8lU9EJw&t=233) 7200MB. 6700MB writing it is almost matching so it is amazing. Now, I will do a 16GB test version. So

- [00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTgd8lU9EJw&t=244) I started another instance. You see it is running in as administrator mode. I am going to set this

- [00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTgd8lU9EJw&t=249) as 16GB. I will make it 3 and I will do another test so we will have a comparison. But amazing

- [00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTgd8lU9EJw&t=256) speeds are amazing. Alright, the Netac NV7000 disk tests have been completed. These are the

- [00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTgd8lU9EJw&t=264) speeds. It is amazing. When we set the test size to 16GB there is a significant drop in writing

- [00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTgd8lU9EJw&t=272) speed. This is probably its cache is getting full and therefore there is a speed decrease. Now,

- [00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTgd8lU9EJw&t=278) I will do the same tests for SanDisk Ultra 3D NVMe, Kingston SNVS2000G, and also Kioxia Exceria

- [00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTgd8lU9EJw&t=289) Plus G2 SSD and I will show you the results immediately and I will comment on them. Okay,

- [00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTgd8lU9EJw&t=295) all the tests on all disks have been completed. Now let's look at them. The first C drive is our

- [00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTgd8lU9EJw&t=304) Netac drive. The second F drive is our SanDisk drive which was the SanDisk drive. Let's remember

- [00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTgd8lU9EJw&t=311) it. So here this is the SanDisk drive. You see the speeds of the SanDisk drive are also pretty decent

- [00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTgd8lU9EJw&t=318) over 2GB per second for sequential reading and writing. The third disk is G drive which is this

- [00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTgd8lU9EJw&t=326) drive and G drive is the Kingston drive as you are seeing the speeds right now. For some reason,

- [00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTgd8lU9EJw&t=332) it is getting very low writing speed at 16GB test as you are seeing here. And the last drive is

- [00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTgd8lU9EJw&t=340) my newest R drive which is Kioxia Exceria Plus G2. You see the speeds are amazing. Other than

- [00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTgd8lU9EJw&t=349) the Netac, I think the winner here is the Kioxia Exceria Plus G2. And now I am going to do massive

- [00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTgd8lU9EJw&t=359) file writing tests. In that test, we will see how they are performing after a certain amount

- [00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTgd8lU9EJw&t=367) of data written to the disk. So these tests will be hugely important. To do these tests,

- [00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTgd8lU9EJw&t=373) I will make a temporary folder here temp22. I will move the Python file. Let's start the cmd and type

- [00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTgd8lU9EJw&t=382) generate file. And here we will watch the writing speed. It is starting. Let's also watch the

- [00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTgd8lU9EJw&t=389) temperature of the disk. Unfortunately, this disk is running under my RTX 3090 Ti GPU. Therefore,

- [00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTgd8lU9EJw&t=397) it is always hotter than it should be. Okay, the writing is going on as you are seeing. The writing

- [00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTgd8lU9EJw&t=404) speed is now like 2GB per second. The temperature is really, really cool right now. There are

- [00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTgd8lU9EJw&t=410) no issues. There is no drop of the writing speed so far. 2GB per second. We can also see

- [00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTgd8lU9EJw&t=417) the file here. Let me show you. Let's click the properties. And you see already 8GB written. Okay,

- [00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTgd8lU9EJw&t=426) we are getting to completed. Still 2.3GB per second. There is no increase in the temperature

- [00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTgd8lU9EJw&t=434) as well. Okay, 2GB per second. Wow, you see there is no drop of the writing speed for Netac. This

- [00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTgd8lU9EJw&t=442) disk is amazing. And we can see yes, okay, 1.1GB per second. I think there is some drop after at

- [00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTgd8lU9EJw&t=452) this point and it is done. So for writing a 150GB file, it took 91.48 seconds and 1.64GB per second

- [00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTgd8lU9EJw&t=466) on average. But after a while, the speed has dropped. You can see it. Let me zoom in. So we

- [00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTgd8lU9EJw&t=472) can see that it was always almost 2GB per second and after a point, it dropped to 1GB per second.

- [00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTgd8lU9EJw&t=481) But it didn't drop lower than that. Okay, now I will test the SanDisk Ultra disk. So I will

- [00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTgd8lU9EJw&t=487) open an CMD inside, Python generate file and let's see the writing speed. Okay, it is starting. Okay,

- [00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTgd8lU9EJw&t=495) initial writing speed is 1.2GB per second. 1.9GB per second. Okay, it drops quickly to 800MB per

- [00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTgd8lU9EJw&t=505) second. You can see that. Okay, now it is writing with 875MB per second. This looks like this disk

- [00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTgd8lU9EJw&t=513) has a very low cache. Therefore, it dropped the speed pretty quickly. So when we are writing

- [00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTgd8lU9EJw&t=520) a big file, this disk is getting a speed drop very quickly. 872MB per second. And let's check

- [00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTgd8lU9EJw&t=530) out the temperature. You see the temperature has risen to 48C. It was like 30C previously. But it

- [00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTgd8lU9EJw&t=539) is not a big issue because I think this disk is running normal under 70C. So it is looking good,

- [00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTgd8lU9EJw&t=549) 875MB per second. So we can say that this disk has a very minimal cache. After that, you are going

- [00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTgd8lU9EJw&t=557) to get constantly 873MB per second. So, SanDisk Ultra got another speed drop after a while. You

- [00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTgd8lU9EJw&t=566) see here it dropped up to 300MB per second and it took 230 seconds to write with average 650MB per

- [00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTgd8lU9EJw&t=577) second. Okay, now it is time to test Kingston and let's see the speed of the G drive. Okay,

- [00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTgd8lU9EJw&t=585) it is beginning with the writing speed of let's see 1.7GB per second. 1.9GB per second. Very good,

- [00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTgd8lU9EJw&t=593) amazing speed. 2.2GB. 2.1GB. Then there is a significant drop here writing speed 100MB per

- [00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTgd8lU9EJw&t=603) second. The biggest problem with this disk is that its cache is almost non-existent. So I do

- [00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTgd8lU9EJw&t=610) not suggest you purchase this disk ever. You see after a while quickly it became horrendous speed

- [00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTgd8lU9EJw&t=620) because the cache is filled. Then there was a significant drop in the speed. Then it backs

- [00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTgd8lU9EJw&t=627) to 2GB momentarily. Then it drops down to 100MB per second again. So this disk is very bad if

- [00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTgd8lU9EJw&t=636) you are working with large files. Avoid this Kingston SNVS2000G drive. It is still writing

- [00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTgd8lU9EJw&t=646) with a horrific speed as you are seeing right now. 80MB per second. The temperature is not rising.

- [00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTgd8lU9EJw&t=653) Obviously, it is not working very much. Time to time it increases the speed like this 700MB per

- [00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTgd8lU9EJw&t=659) second and it goes back to 80MB per second. So this disk is definitely terrible. We will

- [00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTgd8lU9EJw&t=667) see how much time it will take in a moment. Alright, the writing has been completed. It

- [00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTgd8lU9EJw&t=672) took 526 seconds to write the entire file. It was only 290MB per second. So it was a terrible speed

- [00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTgd8lU9EJw&t=686) for the Kingston SNVS2000G. Okay, finally it is time to test my newest drive. So let's begin the

- [00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTgd8lU9EJw&t=697) testing. Alright, the test has begun. Let's see the writing speed. Okay, 1.8GB per second. 1.9GB

- [00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTgd8lU9EJw&t=706) per second. Really good. Let's see how much it can keep up. 2.2GB per second. Amazing speed.

- [00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTgd8lU9EJw&t=714) 2GB per second. 1.4GB per second. There is a significant drop here. 1.4GB per second. Okay,

- [00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTgd8lU9EJw&t=723) after this significant drop, it is still able to keep up 1.4GB per second. If it can keep up

- [00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTgd8lU9EJw&t=730) this speed for the entire operation, it will be super fast. Let's see. It is now 45 Celsius. Okay,

- [00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTgd8lU9EJw&t=739) it is a really good temperature. Still 1.4GB per second. There is no drop. However, you see other

- [00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTgd8lU9EJw&t=746) than the Netac all of them has a lower cache. The cache of Netac is amazing even though it is

- [00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTgd8lU9EJw&t=752) running as a system drive it is still performing very best. After Netac looks like Kioxia Exceria

- [00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTgd8lU9EJw&t=760) Plus G2 is the second best disk. Still 1.3GB per second. There is no drop of speed. I hope it can

- [00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTgd8lU9EJw&t=767) keep up 150GB file for the entire duration. 1.4GB per second. Still amazing speed. There is no drop.

- [00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTgd8lU9EJw&t=776) I see some drop. Maybe it is getting completed. Yes, it is completed. So it took only 105 seconds

- [00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTgd8lU9EJw&t=785) and it was 1.42GB per second. The average speed it is amazing. Okay here we see all the disk speeds.

- [00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTgd8lU9EJw&t=794) The first one the C drive is 1.64GB per second. It is Netac. It is a system disk. However still the

- [00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTgd8lU9EJw&t=802) fastest disk as you are seeing. The second one is 1.42GB per second. It is Kioxia Exceria Plus G2.

- [00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTgd8lU9EJw&t=811) The third disk is my SanDisk drive. SanDisk Ultra 3D 1TB disk. And its speed is 650MB per second.

- [00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTgd8lU9EJw&t=821) And the terrible and horrific speed having disk is Kingston SNVS2000G disk. It is only 290MB per

- [00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTgd8lU9EJw&t=832) second. Terrible. Horrific speed. So when you are purchasing an M.2 SSD disk consider all of

- [00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTgd8lU9EJw&t=839) these factors in your mind and try to purchase a disk which can keep up maximum writing speed

- [00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTgd8lU9EJw&t=846) for the longest time. So the number one disk is Netac. Number two disk is Kioxia Exceria.

- [00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTgd8lU9EJw&t=854) Number three disk is SanDisk Ultra. And the most terrible disk is Kingston drive. I hope you have
