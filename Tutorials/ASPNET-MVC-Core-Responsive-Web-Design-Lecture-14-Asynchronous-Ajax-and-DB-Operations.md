### Video Transcription


- [00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=4) led students welcome to the lecture 14 of responsive web design with asp.net 5

- [00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=7) of responsive web design with asp.net 5 and mvc pattern and bootstrap 5

- [00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=10) and mvc pattern and bootstrap 5 course so today

- [00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=13) course so today this is our last uh tutorial article

- [00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=16) this is our last uh tutorial article related to

- [00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=18) related to this asp.nvidia tutorial.com

- [00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=22) this asp.nvidia tutorial.com it is about working with databases and

- [00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=24) it is about working with databases and we already have worked with database

- [00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=28) we already have worked with database here they are using

- [00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=31) here they are using uh a custom framework a third-party

- [00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=34) uh a custom framework a third-party framework to handle database operations

- [00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=37) framework to handle database operations and their example is not

- [00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=40) and their example is not asynchronous it is doing full post page

- [00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=43) asynchronous it is doing full post page so i plan to implement their example

- [00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=46) so i plan to implement their example with our entity framework and then make

- [00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=49) with our entity framework and then make it uh as asynchronous with ajax queries

- [00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=55) uh as asynchronous with ajax queries so our example will be a more advanced

- [00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=57) so our example will be a more advanced version

- [00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=58) version so let's start as usual with cloning our

- [00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=63) so let's start as usual with cloning our latest project code here

- [00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=72) latest project code here okay okay lecture 14.

- [00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=75) okay okay lecture 14. hopefully i plan to uh show you

- [00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=79) hopefully i plan to uh show you uh bootstrap uh related things in the

- [00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=84) uh bootstrap uh related things in the next week it will be the 15th video

- [00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=87) next week it will be the 15th video normally this is the last week of our

- [00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=89) normally this is the last week of our semester but

- [00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=90) semester but i will record an extra video for you

- [00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=99) okay okay so here it it is talking about uh database engine

- [00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=102) it is talking about uh database engine they have made example with sql server

- [00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=105) they have made example with sql server express local db

- [00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=111) we can also use that or you can use mssql server as well it doesn't matter

- [00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=114) mssql server as well it doesn't matter everything would work exactly same

- [00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=118) everything would work exactly same with a entity framework

- [00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=121) with a entity framework only the connection string would be

- [00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=124) only the connection string would be different

- [00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=131) so there is a to-do list and um it's a very simple thing

- [00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=134) it's a very simple thing as an example so they generate

- [00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=139) as an example so they generate let's see their table

- [00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=142) let's see their table they compose a table such as this one

- [00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=145) they compose a table such as this one so it has id as primary key it has add

- [00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=149) so it has id as primary key it has add date time it says title and it has

- [00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=152) date time it says title and it has a bit is done

- [00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=155) a bit is done okay so we will compose the same table

- [00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=159) okay so we will compose the same table in our

- [00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=160) in our database let's rename this as picture 14

- [00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=171) and also let's open our sql management studio

- [00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=185) okay so it is var character 200 and others are like this

- [00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=199) okay it is taking a little bit of time so they have used a third-party pro

- [00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=201) so they have used a third-party pro framework dapper

- [00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=203) framework dapper it is explained here we will use entity

- [00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=206) it is explained here we will use entity framework with

- [00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=208) framework with uh entity framework tool that we have

- [00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=211) uh entity framework tool that we have added to our

- [00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=213) added to our application okay so this is our database

- [00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=217) application okay so this is our database and let's add a new table

- [00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=219) and let's add a new table as to do list

- [00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=226) okay so it will have id of to do things it will be

- [00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=230) id of to do things it will be primary i won't make it um

- [00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=238) okay i will make it uh identity yeah we don't need to manually set

- [00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=242) yeah we don't need to manually set id so let's make it identity here

- [00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=254) and it has okay update it will be datetime we want all of nodes

- [00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=258) it will be datetime we want all of nodes and for update we can set

- [00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=262) and for update we can set a default time

- [00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=269) a default time or with your money on the peak today

- [00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=271) or with your money on the peak today time

- [00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=273) time so i think i will set it as

- [00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=276) so i think i will set it as uh utc time

- [00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=279) uh utc time okay system utc

- [00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=284) okay system utc date time like this

- [00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=288) date time like this it won't accept if it is not valid so

- [00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=291) it won't accept if it is not valid so then we have

- [00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=292) then we have title of the to-do list

- [00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=296) title of the to-do list and work character 200

- [00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=302) and it's once we know and then we have is done

- [00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=303) is done so is done has default zero

- [00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=311) okay this is a bit and by default it will be zero

- [00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=313) will be zero okay so we have default value for update

- [00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=316) okay so we have default value for update and is done and id is

- [00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=320) is done and id is uh auto increment and we have title

- [00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=323) uh auto increment and we have title let's save it as table to

- [00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=327) let's save it as table to do list

- [00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=334) okay so our date time was valid you can also

- [00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=335) also verify it with select

- [00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=339) verify it with select it is a daytime like this it will return

- [00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=342) it is a daytime like this it will return utc daytime

- [00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=345) utc daytime okay okay so the name didn't

- [00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=349) okay okay so the name didn't go well so let's just restart it

- [00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=366) okay we have composed our table then we will auto generate

- [00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=368) will auto generate the related classes

- [00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=376) okay there is a problem since the renaming didn't go well

- [00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=379) since the renaming didn't go well it is another problem let's just clone

- [00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=382) it is another problem let's just clone it again

- [00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=392) it is not a problem i will delete it later

- [00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=402) version two i would rename that folder later actually

- [00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=417) okay okay let's move to nip okay so um

- [00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=428) start adding with our lecture 14 controller viv

- [00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=430) controller viv and model

- [00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=439) okay we will uh have to wait okay they are getting opened let's

- [00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=441) wait okay they are getting opened let's close

- [00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=442) close everything from our previous lectures

- [00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=447) everything from our previous lectures and wait for visual use your studio to

- [00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=451) and wait for visual use your studio to be fully loaded

- [00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=461) okay okay it looks like pretty much okay there are still background tasks

- [00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=470) okay let's start with adding our lecture 14 folder

- [00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=489) first let's add its default folder to 14.

- [00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=492) to 14. let's add index field of lecture 14.

- [00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=506) okay then let's add controller of lecture 14.

- [00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=531) all right a form as a model uh i will also generate it in a moment

- [00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=534) i will also generate it in a moment but before that i will rename this to

- [00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=538) but before that i will rename this to lecture 14.

- [00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=548) let's rename these two okay so first let's uh generate

- [00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=551) okay so first let's uh generate our ep code if he is eve

- [00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=555) our ep code if he is eve power tools reverse engineer it will

- [00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=557) power tools reverse engineer it will generate the code

- [00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=559) generate the code of our new class

- [00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=562) of our new class then we will inherit it to compose our

- [00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=565) then we will inherit it to compose our model if it is necessary but it won't be

- [00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=567) model if it is necessary but it won't be necessary probably

- [00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=570) necessary probably so you see i am adding new to-do list

- [00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=573) so you see i am adding new to-do list as well i am including

- [00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=577) as well i am including connection stream 2

- [00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=585) okay this is the connection string here and

- [00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=586) and [Music]

- [00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=588) [Music] let's see where it is generated okay

- [00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=591) let's see where it is generated okay here the tbr to-do list

- [00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=593) here the tbr to-do list so you see this is our database

- [00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=597) so you see this is our database table

- [00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=603) however i am going to add some customization to this

- [00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=606) customization to this class in lecture 14 model

- [00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=610) class in lecture 14 model okay

- [00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=618) what kind of customization if you wonder let me show you

- [00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=632) okay plus lecture 14. okay so this class

- [00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=636) lecture 14. okay so this class will inherit uh

- [00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=639) will inherit uh tbl to do list like this therefore all

- [00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=643) tbl to do list like this therefore all of the items will be

- [00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=644) of the items will be available and simply

- [00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=650) available and simply we will add some requirement

- [00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=654) we will add some requirement such as how we gonna do that

- [00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=658) such as how we gonna do that is

- [00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=660) is again let's check it out

- [00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=690) i will have other values or

- [00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=710) so we can can we override it let's try

- [00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=716) let's try prop and heidi

- [00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=728) so okay so it's very hide the inherited id

- [00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=737) use the new keyboard if i didn't give us impact and

- [00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=740) impact and intended here

- [00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=744) intended here so high place manager plus i need

- [00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=748) so high place manager plus i need right base member and

- [00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=772) okay oh this won't be required because this

- [00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=774) oh this won't be required because this is automatic

- [00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=775) is automatic okay i don't need to do that

- [00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=782) i need to i don't also need a date time as well i just need to

- [00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=785) date time as well i just need to overwrite title

- [00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=788) overwrite title so i will overwrite it speak new

- [00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=792) so i will overwrite it speak new actually it will hide the previous title

- [00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=795) actually it will hide the previous title it is as public string

- [00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=800) is as public string okay so the

- [00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=810) yeah so title must contain at least two characters and something must contain at

- [00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=812) characters and something must contain at least 200 characters

- [00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=814) least 200 characters and i would hide it like this but if i

- [00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=818) and i would hide it like this but if i hide it what happens

- [00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=834) and then we have is done okay i also know don't need anything

- [00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=836) okay i also know don't need anything regarding to that

- [00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=839) regarding to that okay so lecture 14

- [00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=842) okay so lecture 14 model will be like this

- [00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=845) model will be like this we have updated our class okay let's

- [00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=847) we have updated our class okay let's continue

- [00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=855) okay then there is two list view model let's read it

- [00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=859) let's read it so which v model we will list

- [00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=862) so which v model we will list whatever is available

- [00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=865) whatever is available okay so here in our controller

- [00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=870) okay so here in our controller which is here here we will load whatever

- [00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=874) which is here here we will load whatever what is available

- [00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=875) what is available inside the database and to use that we

- [00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=879) inside the database and to use that we will have using

- [00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=880) will have using okay so there is our mvc context

- [00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=884) okay so there is our mvc context here okay my context

- [00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=888) here okay my context like this let me see context

- [00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=900) and here let's define our lecture 14 model

- [00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=908) what is the name of our lecture 14 it is just lecture 14 so let's add it to

- [00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=910) it is just lecture 14 so let's add it to here using

- [00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=913) here using okay uh lecture nine model starts

- [00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=918) okay uh lecture nine model starts yeah just this and

- [00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=921) yeah just this and lecture 14

- [00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=924) lecture 14 my model also need my

- [00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=927) my model also need my name lecture 14.

- [00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=936) and we are going to have tbi to-do list

- [00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=940) tbi to-do list okay and one moment

- [00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=949) okay so here we will [Music]

- [00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=951) [Music] select all the to-do list

- [00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=955) select all the to-do list okay and how we gonna do that

- [00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=958) okay and how we gonna do that is i think

- [00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=960) is i think [Music]

- [00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=962) [Music] it was like

- [00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=967) it was like okay let's see what options we have we

- [00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=970) okay let's see what options we have we have find

- [00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=977) okay now find all no

- [00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=1004) let us take a real quick union zip i think i will use

- [00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=1011) i think i will use okay this is selector so

- [00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=1024) anti-framework so it will take a little bit of time to

- [00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=1027) so it will take a little bit of time to get me used to

- [00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=1038) which is what is like this so here my contacts.tbrl

- [00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=1042) so here my contacts.tbrl to the list so this will return

- [00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=1046) to the list so this will return okay a set of all to-do lists

- [00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=1062) actually this is a list of our model probably let me check it

- [00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=1092) okay probably i need to get it to a list like this

- [00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=1103) so our model actually is a single element therefore i need to

- [00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=1106) is a single element therefore i need to modify my model

- [00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=1109) modify my model how am i going to do that is

- [00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=1138) so this is today this lecture 14 and

- [00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=1169) um item let's see all to do items

- [00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=1178) okay like this so it will contain to the item

- [00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=1186) and i need to cast this into my list how am i going to do that is

- [00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=1195) it will be like this okay and this thing to the items will be equal to

- [00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=1198) to the items will be equal to to list and i need to cast it yeah

- [00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=1203) to list and i need to cast it yeah what am i gonna cast is

- [00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=1206) what am i gonna cast is to the item

- [00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=1269) maybe something like this and we will call the cast here

- [00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=1286) it won't be supporting explicit casting i think

- [00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=1291) explicit casting i think i can have a constructor as to the item

- [00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=1294) i can have a constructor as to the item here

- [00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=1296) here so like this i'll make

- [00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=1300) so like this i'll make okay to the item

- [00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=1304) okay to the item and in the constructors

- [00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=1339) okay so how can we achieve that i have never done something like this before

- [00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=1355) c-sharp pass to child class wrong parent class yeah

- [00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=1359) wrong parent class yeah let's see

- [00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=1365) okay costs child object as parent how do we do that

- [00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=1395) okay so there is person clause then there's customer class which inherits

- [00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=1397) there's customer class which inherits person and it has some extra type

- [00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=1426) okay so here's we have customer person employee person

- [00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=1428) employee person so the customer per person base first

- [00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=1453) so this is a copy constructors maybe we can do that

- [00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=1458) maybe we can do that which is something like this

- [00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=1461) which is something like this public

- [00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=1472) to do let's put it like this

- [00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=1492) there is base that's title equal to these are title

- [00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=1496) equal to these are title in the constructors

- [00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=1500) in the constructors and still we need to cast it to our

- [00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=1503) and still we need to cast it to our item so this is rather an advanced topic

- [00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=1514) item so this is rather an advanced topic maybe we can cast it like this

- [00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=1534) and explicit cast so listen to me this is right

- [00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=1542) here yeah let's see if it will work

- [00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=1546) yeah let's see if it will work i'm not sure then we will return

- [00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=1551) i'm not sure then we will return uh index actually it is like this index

- [00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=1555) uh index actually it is like this index view with our model which will be this

- [00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=1560) with our model which will be this and let's get back to our next one here

- [00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=1563) and let's get back to our next one here we will have our

- [00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=1566) we will have our model

- [00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=1566) model [Music]

- [00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=1569) [Music] let me as

- [00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=1570) let me as [Music]

- [00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=1572) [Music] lecture 9 model start lecture 14

- [00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=1585) okay so i will add a debug here and

- [00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=1589) a debug here and let's add some random value

- [00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=1598) let's add some random value okay so test one okay it is added

- [00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=1603) okay so test one okay it is added and let's run the application

- [00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=1669) okay so lecture 14 dot index okay

- [00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=1672) dot index okay it is triggered let's see what happens

- [00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=1675) it is triggered let's see what happens in our casting okay unable to cast

- [00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=1678) in our casting okay unable to cast object type of circuits

- [00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=1681) object type of circuits two type of yeah so our casting didn't

- [00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=1685) two type of yeah so our casting didn't work

- [00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=1686) work what we need to do is we need to extend

- [00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=1689) what we need to do is we need to extend base class to convert it

- [00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=1706) um something like it here i'll mix static

- [00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=1723) i will add this to global methods actually

- [00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=1733) okay here we have global controller with our global methods here

- [00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=1738) with our global methods here yeah here i can write it as an extension

- [00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=1742) yeah here i can write it as an extension okay it has to be under some cluster

- [00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=1746) okay it has to be under some cluster so let's see

- [00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=1749) so let's see global methods here only static to your

- [00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=1752) global methods here only static to your item

- [00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=1754) item um let's name it as convert

- [00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=1767) child okay let's also off let's say convert to do yeah

- [00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=1771) convert to do yeah and this will take this tbl

- [00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=1775) and this will take this tbl okay to-do list my list

- [00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=1780) okay to-do list my list and what it is going to do is

- [00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=1784) and what it is going to do is it will define a to-do class object

- [00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=1793) and need to do item and simply i will just

- [00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=1796) and simply i will just have constructed as

- [00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=1799) have constructed as table to-do list my list

- [00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=1803) table to-do list my list and basically

- [00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=1811) this will assign as my list title this dot id equal to my list start

- [00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=1816) this dot id equal to my list start id is that um is none is equal to minus

- [00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=1821) id is that um is none is equal to minus that is down and

- [00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=1824) is down and is that id title

- [00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=1829) is that id title that take equals on minus start and date

- [00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=1832) that take equals on minus start and date yeah

- [00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=1847) okay this simply yeah so this is an expansion extension

- [00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=1851) yeah so this is an expansion extension and here when we select them

- [00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=1855) and here when we select them uh we will select them as

- [00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=1858) uh we will select them as we are to convert to do here

- [00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=1863) we are to convert to do here and then we will

- [00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=1870) convert it to list okay now it should work

- [00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=1872) work let's see

- [00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=1898) so here to do list you see i could modify

- [00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=1898) modify this as well however whenever you

- [00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=1901) this as well however whenever you replace your

- [00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=1903) replace your database classes this will get overrated

- [00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=1906) database classes this will get overrated therefore

- [00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=1906) therefore you shouldn't make any changes here

- [00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=1910) you shouldn't make any changes here okay okay so lecture 14

- [00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=1914) okay okay so lecture 14 index

- [00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=1921) okay it is working and we have our item here as you can see

- [00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=1929) all right let's also set this as a route so currently it is opening i think

- [00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=1934) so currently it is opening i think um lecture 10

- [00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=1938) um lecture 10 if i remember correctly yeah so it is

- [00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=1941) if i remember correctly yeah so it is opening lecture 10 i will

- [00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=1944) opening lecture 10 i will start opening lecture 14 as default like

- [00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=1947) start opening lecture 14 as default like this

- [00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=1949) this and let's check the

- [00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=1953) and let's check the lectures on if there is any other

- [00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=1956) lectures on if there is any other routing

- [00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=1964) okay no uh we don't need lecture 10 anymore by the way so let's

- [00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=1967) lecture 10 anymore by the way so let's continue with the

- [00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=1968) continue with the tutorial article so we are having this

- [00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=1972) tutorial article so we are having this uh right now in our format

- [00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=1980) and in the view it is something like this let's add this to our

- [00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=1982) this let's add this to our weave

- [00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=1990) okay so it uses create update home for methods

- [00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=1992) methods so our model dot um

- [00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=2001) i see we need to have for each so this is for

- [00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=2004) for each so this is for adding i think

- [00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=2014) let's see there is yeah so this is adding part

- [00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=2015) adding part i think part is something like this so

- [00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=2018) i think part is something like this so in the editing part

- [00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=2019) in the editing part it will be

- [00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=2040) okay so in our model for to be able to add we need

- [00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=2041) add we need another instance let's go to our

- [00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=2045) another instance let's go to our model make your protein here

- [00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=2049) model make your protein here and we will have list to keep the list

- [00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=2053) and we will have list to keep the list of uh items from database and we need an

- [00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=2056) uh items from database and we need an instance of to the item

- [00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=2059) instance of to the item okay publish to the item

- [00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=2064) okay publish to the item name to task

- [00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=2075) this okay so it doesn't have a default constructor

- [00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=2077) so it doesn't have a default constructor therefore i also need to set that

- [00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=2081) therefore i also need to set that something like this

- [00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=2089) and yeah okay now it should work yeah so

- [00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=2092) yeah so model dots need to do task

- [00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=2096) model dots need to do task dot id yeah hidden for

- [00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=2100) dot id yeah hidden for we can also have display thing if we

- [00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=2103) we can also have display thing if we want

- [00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=2103) want but this is hidden therefore it won't be

- [00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=2107) but this is hidden therefore it won't be visible

- [00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=2109) visible and we have title form control okay

- [00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=2113) and we have title form control okay and we have id so if id is bigger than

- [00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=2117) and we have id so if id is bigger than zero

- [00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=2122) it will be update otherwise it will be red

- [00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=2124) red okay it is done

- [00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=2127) okay it is done so basically this will

- [00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=2130) so basically this will call home controller create update

- [00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=2134) call home controller create update however i will change it so let's

- [00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=2141) start with coding our edit method this will be

- [00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=2143) will be http post only

- [00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=2150) like this and i will call it as update add or update

- [00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=2153) update add or update insert yeah and i will also add

- [00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=2157) insert yeah and i will also add a rule for it so root will be

- [00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=2165) something like this lecture 14 [Music]

- [00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=2171) okay and update insert and let's give it a name so we can access it directly

- [00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=2175) name so we can access it directly [Music]

- [00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=2177) [Music] update insert name

- [00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=2180) update insert name to the task

- [00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=2187) okay it will take our to-do model my model

- [00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=2192) our to-do model my model okay here's

- [00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=2200) okay we are setting id we are setting title

- [00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=2201) title actually we are not setting id we are

- [00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=2203) actually we are not setting id we are setting title

- [00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=2205) setting title only yeah other things are default

- [00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=2209) only yeah other things are default and

- [00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=2210) and [Music]

- [00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=2212) [Music] we will check if my model is

- [00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=2217) we will check if my model is valid if

- [00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=2221) valid if all the motor state is valid

- [00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=2226) all the motor state is valid if it is not validated but return

- [00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=2230) if it is not validated but return and then what we are going to do is

- [00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=2233) and then what we are going to do is simply

- [00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=2234) simply return content yeah

- [00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=2243) okay okay some

- [00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=2247) okay some unexpected error accurate

- [00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=2251) unexpected error accurate please try again

- [00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=2261) if it is not valid if it is embodied then we will check

- [00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=2267) basically we will just use update yeah so to be able to use update what we

- [00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=2271) yeah so to be able to use update what we are going to do

- [00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=2272) are going to do is okay

- [00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=2275) is okay um we need to convert this

- [00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=2279) um we need to convert this into the base model we can do it

- [00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=2283) into the base model we can do it my tbl

- [00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=2287) my tbl to-do list okay updated

- [00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=2290) to-do list okay updated item

- [00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=2296) will be equal to tbr to do lists

- [00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=2299) to do lists my model i think this should work

- [00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=2313) okay there is add however if it is updated

- [00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=2314) updated will this work

- [00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=2364) okay there is add or update which is from entity framework

- [00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=2366) from entity framework okay migrations so basically i will use

- [00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=2370) okay migrations so basically i will use that

- [00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=2383) for add or update we need to add and framework migrations

- [00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=2408) and since we are using anti-framework tools

- [00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=2410) tools we may not have anticipated migrations

- [00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=2473) let's try this way and see if it is working or not

- [00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=2481) okay so basically uh we will add a new item

- [00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=2496) set its um state modified

- [00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=2520) and okay it doesn't support this in the end framework obviously

- [00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=2530) yeah okay it is working so there is entry

- [00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=2531) entry state equal to enter state dot

- [00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=2536) state equal to enter state dot modified

- [00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=2543) and then we will call save changes okay so this is for both update and

- [00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=2549) delete uh currently this will be always at

- [00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=2554) uh currently this will be always at because we are not getting any id

- [00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=2558) because we are not getting any id so first let's try this and if it is

- [00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=2560) so first let's try this and if it is working or not

- [00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=2561) working or not let's see that

- [00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=2564) let's see that then we will also work on the update as

- [00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=2598) okay so yeah it is like this test two at

- [00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=2602) test two at okay so it did go home create

- [00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=2605) okay so it did go home create ah we didn't fix the uh

- [00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=2608) ah we didn't fix the uh naming in our weave let's fix that

- [00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=2620) okay we will just give roach name those values as let's see

- [00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=2632) so there is html begin form which takes let's see

- [00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=2650) okay simple begin form i can't see the parameters that it takes

- [00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=2662) so okay so there's four method t model

- [00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=2664) okay so there's four method t model attributes okay now i can see

- [00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=2667) attributes okay now i can see okay four methods support attributes

- [00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=2683) action name yeah so i need to have what is it also to use

- [00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=2693) okay i think i'll use classical methods that we have used in

- [00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=2696) classical methods that we have used in our previous lecture

- [00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=2699) our previous lecture it is better approach so in

- [00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=2702) it is better approach so in here we have this

- [00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=2705) here we have this let's copy and paste it

- [00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=2712) so here's okay and let's take our road name

- [00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=2717) and let's take our road name yes then we have

- [00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=2722) yes then we have a hidden force so input and

- [00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=2727) a hidden force so input and let's see asp

- [00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=2757) so there is asp for but asv hidden for okay so that is just type hidden

- [00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=2761) okay so that is just type hidden type okay

- [00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=2768) hidden here and it will be for

- [00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=2775) okay id actually it should automatically get it

- [00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=2782) it doesn't get this will be hidden there for no actually they are

- [00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=2786) no actually they are not

- [00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=2788) not [Music]

- [00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=2791) [Music] being seen right now even though we did

- [00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=2794) being seen right now even though we did attack helpers

- [00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=2797) attack helpers so where is the problem

- [00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=2802) so where is the problem remove this

- [00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=2806) and [Music]

- [00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=2821) okay still the talk helpers is not visible

- [00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=2837) okay interesting i don't see the talk at all

- [00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=2838) all okay so the talk helpers are visible

- [00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=2840) okay so the talk helpers are visible here

- [00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=2859) and why is that maybe let's close and okay now visible

- [00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=2863) maybe let's close and okay now visible here

- [00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=2864) here so type hidden asp for id

- [00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=2867) so type hidden asp for id value is nothing

- [00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=2877) so id is not visible i have to set it like this yeah

- [00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=2879) like this yeah okay and

- [00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=2913) one second so this is the code that we did get and then we have text box for

- [00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=2922) yeah something like this we give to the title we can also have a custom

- [00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=2926) to the title we can also have a custom title

- [00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=2928) title so let's also set that in our model

- [00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=2932) so let's also set that in our model which is here and here

- [00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=2942) it's going to display okay i think something like this

- [00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=2968) your name i was remembering it correctly which is

- [00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=2972) correctly which is in our controllers

- [00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=2975) in our controllers yes it will be named

- [00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=2983) equal to understand description okay [Music]

- [00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=2985) [Music] and let's close this here

- [00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=2989) and let's close this here we have title label and we have sv4

- [00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=2993) we have title label and we have sv4 this will be an input

- [00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=3001) okay enter task title

- [00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=3005) task title and yeah we have sent back

- [00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=3009) and yeah we have sent back okay now it should work

- [00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=3018) we used hack helpers which is better than

- [00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=3019) than html4 in my opinion

- [00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=3041) okay so let's wait it to run by the way after our prospect

- [00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=3045) by the way after our prospect what do we return we return index

- [00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=3049) what do we return we return index my model here so with this way we can

- [00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=3052) my model here so with this way we can update

- [00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=3053) update as well so let's enter a task title

- [00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=3057) as well so let's enter a task title as test two and

- [00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=3060) as test two and okay some unexpected error occurs so it

- [00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=3062) okay some unexpected error occurs so it is not

- [00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=3063) is not valid i wonder why

- [00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=3075) so here our model i think it is because id

- [00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=3075) id is zero and title is null

- [00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=3097) we have need to do this title value is zero

- [00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=3127) okay so we have new tasks you to do task we have new lists

- [00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=3139) and we are binding it but it is not possible back

- [00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=3160) okay updating insert input type and then the id field is required but we didn't

- [00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=3163) the id field is required but we didn't we didn't bind it we bind it to 0 by

- [00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=3165) we didn't bind it we bind it to 0 by default and then we have task

- [00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=3168) default and then we have task description we have task title

- [00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=3172) description we have task title so the test title is

- [00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=3176) so the test title is let's see where is the name

- [00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=3186) id need to do task title when the name is new to the task title

- [00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=3190) when the name is new to the task title okay but it does not post break it here

- [00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=3193) okay but it does not post break it here that is weird

- [00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=3199) to do item my models i think i know because we will we need to expect

- [00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=3202) because we will we need to expect lecture 14 not my model it will be

- [00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=3205) lecture 14 not my model it will be lecture 14.

- [00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=3209) lecture 14. like this and now it should work here

- [00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=3212) like this and now it should work here so my model dot to the need to do task

- [00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=3217) so my model dot to the need to do task okay so you see minor address can cause

- [00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=3221) okay so you see minor address can cause a lot of problems and

- [00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=3225) a lot of problems and require a lot of time to figure out what

- [00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=3227) require a lot of time to figure out what is wrong

- [00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=3229) is wrong you have to be careful all right

- [00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=3236) you have to be careful all right so let's

- [00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=3239) so let's test it

- [00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=3248) okay now test two and okay so it says that

- [00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=3251) and okay so it says that id has a temporary value while

- [00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=3253) id has a temporary value while attempting change it's

- [00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=3254) attempting change it's the answer to the modified

- [00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=3266) okay so it appears that uh since it is

- [00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=3270) uh since it is auto increment how

- [00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=3273) auto increment how should we proceed

- [00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=3339) increment idea let's see

- [00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=3363) okay um like we need to find whether this exists

- [00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=3364) this exists if it did not exist then we need to add

- [00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=3368) if it did not exist then we need to add if it exists and we need to modify

- [00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=3377) and how can we do that we can do it with um reflection

- [00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=3380) um reflection copy it record it here

- [00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=3383) copy it record it here let me check it reflection method to

- [00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=3391) copy log errors refresh model

- [00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=3405) so we have update user method here this will be basically same

- [00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=3408) will be basically same methodology

- [00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=3418) i think i will edit here but i will use reflection to copy all values

- [00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=3435) let's say update at new task

- [00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=3438) at new task it will take what it is going to take is

- [00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=3442) it will take what it is going to take is let's close this what it is going to

- [00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=3445) let's close this what it is going to take is today list item

- [00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=3454) new task and it will select from tv a to-do list

- [00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=3459) it will select from tv a to-do list [Music]

- [00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=3468) id okay if it is not equal to null then we will copy all the

- [00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=3472) equal to null then we will copy all the values

- [00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=3474) values and how we gonna do that

- [00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=3481) easily copy all items of class with

- [00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=3517) okay so it is here we will use generics you see this is the

- [00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=3519) we will use generics you see this is the generic class

- [00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=3521) generic class generic clone it just serialize object

- [00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=3524) generic clone it just serialize object and then return the serialized object

- [00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=3528) and then return the serialized object and if it is not null what we are going

- [00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=3531) and if it is not null what we are going to do is basically

- [00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=3538) um vr user will be equal to new task

- [00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=3543) to new task clone okay come on is not

- [00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=3548) clone okay come on is not available

- [00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=3559) check it out yeah it will be like this extension

- [00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=3573) the serialized object yeah so

- [00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=3576) yeah so clone and the cloning type will be

- [00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=3586) material to do list like this otherwise it will just edit

- [00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=3590) otherwise it will just edit uh edit as a new task and we will call

- [00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=3593) uh edit as a new task and we will call save changes okay so basically we will

- [00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=3597) save changes okay so basically we will clone

- [00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=3598) clone this object into this

- [01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=3605) and therefore it should update the changes

- [01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=3606) changes i'm not sure what i'm expecting it to do

- [01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=3615) basically then we will call it here global methods dot update or donate

- [01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=3618) global methods dot update or donate new task it will be

- [01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=3621) new task it will be taken from here okay let's see what

- [01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=3625) taken from here okay let's see what happens now

- [01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=3640) so if that id exists we will update it if it doesn't exist uh we will

- [01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=3651) edit and we are using cloning method to not set them one by one

- [01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=3654) to not set them one by one you see in our previous lecture we did

- [01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=3657) you see in our previous lecture we did set each value like this however now i

- [01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=3661) set each value like this however now i am using clone

- [01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=3663) am using clone which should automatically set all of

- [01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=3665) which should automatically set all of the values

- [01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=3667) the values okay test two and

- [01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=3672) okay test two and yeah we have an address what is the

- [01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=3675) yeah we have an address what is the error cannot insert knowledge column

- [01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=3676) error cannot insert knowledge column title

- [01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=3690) sent as null and why

- [01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=3700) let's see why maybe our casting didn't work

- [01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=3731) okay test2 and let's see if the data is here okay the

- [01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=3733) let's see if the data is here okay the data is not

- [01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=3734) data is not here

- [01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=3743) yeah currently title is not set you see there are two titles one of them

- [01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=3746) you see there are two titles one of them is from the

- [01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=3747) is from the base class and the other one is from the

- [01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=3751) base class and the other one is from the other class but it is

- [01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=3754) other class but it is not binded

- [01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=3766) okay name is new to the task title and from our model

- [01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=3802) okay maybe it is because we are setting a value here maybe i need to change it

- [01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=3810) a value here maybe i need to change it but it doesn't make sense it should work

- [01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=3813) but it doesn't make sense it should work like this

- [01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=3815) like this let's see

- [01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=3823) lecture 13 car name and here's this from lecture nine model studio item

- [01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=3832) mode lecture 14 needs to do task yeah this is the class

- [01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=3833) this is the class and this is the object

- [01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=3839) and this is the object this is the method that are we using

- [01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=3843) this is the method that are we using everything is looking correct

- [01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=3847) everything is looking correct but when we post batch

- [01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=3852) but when we post batch we have a problem

- [01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=3865) we have a problem and we need to find what is the problem

- [01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=3883) maybe it is because the base class is uh base title is hidden

- [01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=3886) uh base title is hidden it shouldn't be that way but i am not

- [01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=3888) it shouldn't be that way but i am not sure

- [01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=3890) sure we have a to-do item here need to do

- [01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=3892) we have a to-do item here need to do tasks

- [01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=3894) tasks we have a title

- [01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=3905) it is looking like a correct name is new to the task title

- [01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=3909) to the task title id is this one

- [01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=3922) id is this one but the title information is not

- [01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=3965) okay this is the mod which is using

- [01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=3969) this is the mod which is using title is here

- [01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=3978) title is here let's try something else

- [01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=3987) okay let me check it oh maybe i know the reason yeah because

- [01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=3990) oh maybe i know the reason yeah because it is not

- [01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=3991) it is not set and yet

- [01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=3998) okay let me show you why it is not working so this one will probe

- [01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=4001) working so this one will probe uh to the item need to do task

- [01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=4004) uh to the item need to do task get and unset it will be

- [01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=4009) get and unset it will be something like this

- [01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=4039) but it will be not initialized there i have i also need to utilize it

- [01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=4041) have i also need to utilize it but it won't work either i need to have

- [01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=4044) but it won't work either i need to have a constructor for

- [01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=4046) a constructor for lecture 14 like this

- [01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=4050) lecture 14 like this and i need to initialize it like this

- [01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=4054) and i need to initialize it like this yeah now it will work this is

- [01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=4057) yeah now it will work this is now gettable and settable

- [01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=4067) you see get and set makes a lot of difference

- [01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=4069) difference when working with model binding

- [01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=4101) okay test two now i am pretty sure it will be here

- [01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=4103) will be here yeah you see now it is returned into a

- [01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=4106) yeah you see now it is returned into a property it was

- [01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=4108) property it was a field before now i can see title

- [01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=4112) a field before now i can see title and okay another requirement see in the

- [01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=4114) and okay another requirement see in the exception it says that cannot insert

- [01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=4116) exception it says that cannot insert null into column

- [01:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=4118) null into column value and

- [01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=4121) value and why

- [01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=4134) therefore this is working okay it says that it cannot insert

- [01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=4137) okay it says that it cannot insert no title or

- [01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=4144) so this new task is still from

- [01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=4160) it is not from the base class you see there are two title and

- [01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=4181) yeah the original title is hidden so this is not

- [01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=4182) this is not also a type of

- [01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=4186) also a type of okay you see this is type of to-do item

- [01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=4188) okay you see this is type of to-do item it is not from

- [01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=4190) it is not from tbr to do list type so when we are

- [01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=4194) tbr to do list type so when we are calling this method

- [01:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=4196) calling this method let's find it we need to explicitly

- [01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=4200) let's find it we need to explicitly convert it

- [01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=4269) yeah yeah i think we can use as operators so

- [01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=4273) operators so this will be us like this

- [01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=4315) but i i am hoping that it will work okay so this is still prone to the item

- [01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=4318) okay so this is still prone to the item type

- [01:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=4325) it is not the type that we are looking for

- [01:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=4325) for you see think a new variable is causing

- [01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=4329) you see think a new variable is causing a lot of problems so

- [01:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=4332) a lot of problems so we need to add an extension

- [01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=4335) we need to add an extension to our custom class

- [01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=4339) to our custom class such as that

- [01:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=4343) such as that how to do it

- [01:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=4356) how to do it i think i have an idea

- [01:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=4365) let's add a method here as public fix title

- [01:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=4370) fix title public voice by the way

- [01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=4377) and it will set um base dot title equal to this that title here

- [01:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=4383) dot title equal to this that title here and now

- [01:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=4399) fixed title yes um new task by the way nick's ask is not

- [01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=4403) um new task by the way nick's ask is not from

- [01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=4404) from base class here therefore before we

- [01:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=4426) like here what you need to do space title

- [01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=4430) what you need to do space title okay now let's see

- [01:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=4460) okay now test two yeah it did work we have no error the url

- [01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=4463) it did work we have no error the url change it

- [01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=4465) change it and notice so now we can we should be

- [01:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=4467) and notice so now we can we should be able to update test2 because

- [01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=4469) able to update test2 because currently its uh id

- [01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=4472) currently its uh id should be set as true to let's see

- [01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=4476) should be set as true to let's see no it is set as zero still

- [01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=4479) no it is set as zero still so i didn't know that so test three

- [01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=4483) so i didn't know that so test three let's check it out yeah it has three is

- [01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=4485) let's check it out yeah it has three is here as well

- [01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=4488) here as well okay currently we are able to

- [01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=4491) okay currently we are able to [Music]

- [01:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=4492) [Music] add new values but we are currently not

- [01:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=4495) add new values but we are currently not able to update them

- [01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=4496) able to update them and we will also code that

- [01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=4500) and we will also code that pause here

- [01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=4508) okay now that we can say we can continue okay so

- [01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=4515) since our web app only has one wave there's no need for reasonable layout

- [01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=4524) okay yeah and now there is a for each loop to print what is on the screen

- [01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=4528) to print what is on the screen what's on the database uh to the screen

- [01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=4532) what's on the database uh to the screen so it will be here it user for each and

- [01:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=4536) so it will be here it user for each and our model has

- [01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=4539) our model has this one as items and here

- [01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=4544) this one as items and here we will have item that is done

- [01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=4554) okay and yeah it should work and then we have

- [01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=4557) and then we have item dot id

- [01:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=4561) item dot id title yeah

- [01:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=4564) title yeah and date okay so what does this do

- [01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=4568) and date okay so what does this do is you see it has a on click window

- [01:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=4571) is you see it has a on click window location here

- [01:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=4573) location here uh this is the javascript uh

- [01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=4577) uh this is the javascript uh method and when we click on this

- [01:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=4579) method and when we click on this checkbox

- [01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=4581) checkbox it will redirect page to

- [01:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=4587) it will redirect page to home toggle is done by the way

- [01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=4595) we have this as a root url right now but i will add another path

- [01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=4599) but i will add another path um to redirect so

- [01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=4603) um to redirect so let's make it as

- [01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=4608) let's make it as okay um is done yeah

- [01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=4634) we are also going to take a parameter um

- [01:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=4642) so let's also put that optional parameter as

- [01:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=4659) mandatory and yeah it will provide it like this

- [01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=4663) yeah it will provide it like this okay

- [01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=4669) and then there is a checkbox so for the checkbox we are going to have

- [01:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=4672) checkbox we are going to have home edit uh location

- [01:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=4676) home edit uh location and this will open a new weave

- [01:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=4681) and this will open a new weave to update it

- [01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=4685) to update it okay so

- [01:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=4692) for updates let's see what can we do we will use

- [01:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=4694) let's see what can we do we will use this in the update

- [01:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=4696) this in the update and basically home edit will

- [01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=4700) and basically home edit will uh load this

- [01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=4704) uh load this with their methods

- [01:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=4712) what i mean that i will show in a moment or let's say change

- [01:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=4716) or let's say change task status so this will

- [01:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=4719) task status so this will take an integer id task id

- [01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=4724) take an integer id task id and we won't have a model here

- [01:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=4729) and we won't have a model here so it will be integers therefore

- [01:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=4732) so it will be integers therefore what we are going to do is

- [01:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=4739) basically we will find uh the item as

- [01:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=4747) okay task item is going will be equal to my context

- [01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=4749) my context uh tbr to-do list

- [01:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=4753) uh tbr to-do list and then we will have find so the fine

- [01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=4756) and then we will have find so the fine take

- [01:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=4757) take here is values

- [01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=4764) and it is taking area of object so maybe we can just provide like

- [01:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=4768) object so maybe we can just provide like this

- [01:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=4770) this then i will get

- [01:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=4788) okay so if not found it for the return null if

- [01:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=4789) null if we are task item not equal to

- [01:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=4793) we are task item not equal to null okay we will change

- [01:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=4796) null okay we will change is done as um

- [01:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=4800) is done as um opposite of is done

- [01:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=4804) opposite of is done like this and then we will save the

- [01:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=4807) like this and then we will save the changes

- [01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=4809) changes i think this will become at rocket item

- [01:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=4812) i think this will become at rocket item therefore

- [01:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=4813) therefore i can just click save changes

- [01:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=4816) i can just click save changes and it should be done okay and then

- [01:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=4820) and it should be done okay and then we will return index field nothing else

- [01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=4825) we will return index field nothing else but if you want to list items on the

- [01:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=4829) but if you want to list items on the screen

- [01:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=4830) screen then i need to initialize model and

- [01:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=4833) then i need to initialize model and return it

- [01:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=4835) return it therefore

- [01:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=4843) what i am going to do is i will have a private method here private

- [01:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=4853) lecture 14 okay model to returning okay init model

- [01:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=4861) you see lecture 14 is being a little with

- [01:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=4861) with another good name for model

- [01:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=4864) another good name for model uh so it would be better to change its

- [01:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=4867) uh so it would be better to change its name but

- [01:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=4869) name but it will take a lot of places to be

- [01:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=4871) it will take a lot of places to be changed right now

- [01:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=4877) so i will just keep it but you shouldn't give a model name like this

- [01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=4880) give a model name like this um so this will return

- [01:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=4883) um so this will return a model and basically what it is going

- [01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=4886) a model and basically what it is going to do

- [01:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=4887) to do is it will

- [01:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=4890) is it will return my model like this

- [01:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=4894) return my model like this and we will have lecture 14 model

- [01:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=4899) and we will have lecture 14 model equal to in its model

- [01:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=4916) guess model again like this

- [01:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=4923) let's see here and we will return it okay i think it should work but

- [01:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=4927) okay i think it should work but since this is a different url

- [01:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=4930) since this is a different url i think the url of the page will change

- [01:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=4940) if i want to not change the url i have to make a redirect

- [01:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=4945) the url i have to make a redirect so perhaps a better approach would be

- [01:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=4949) so perhaps a better approach would be making a redirect to the index page

- [01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=4956) okay we have done that in the previous lectures so

- [01:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=4986) yeah we have redirected action so it will redirect to action index

- [01:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=4990) so it will redirect to action index and let's see the behaviors

- [01:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=4993) and let's see the behaviors behave of the application

- [01:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=4997) behave of the application expo here's

- [01:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=5001) expo here's i will do it like this

- [01:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=5009) okay so this will be our paths lecture 14 is done task id

- [01:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=5012) 14 is done task id let's open our index here

- [01:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=5015) let's open our index here so we will have a checkbox and yeah

- [01:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=5019) so we will have a checkbox and yeah let's uh first test uh

- [01:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=5022) let's uh first test uh the checkbox and whether it is working

- [01:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=5024) the checkbox and whether it is working or not

- [01:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=5030) so currently all of my items are is done is zero pulse which means

- [01:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=5065) okay it says that we have two road name yeah we didn't change the road name

- [01:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=5067) yeah we didn't change the road name therefore we have an error

- [01:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=5070) therefore we have an error okay let's say change

- [01:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=5073) okay let's say change is done

- [01:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=5078) you see at runtime it is checking the road names

- [01:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=5079) road names and draws an error

- [01:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=5109) okay so here's our listed items when i check box it will

- [01:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=5114) listed items when i check box it will become check it and let's see yes when i

- [01:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=5117) become check it and let's see yes when i check it you see it is doing a redirect

- [01:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=5120) check it you see it is doing a redirect and yeah it is working as

- [01:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=5123) and yeah it is working as expected let's see what happens in the

- [01:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=5126) expected let's see what happens in the network

- [01:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=5134) so currently uh 101 i will change this one

- [01:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=5136) one so it it went back which is done url

- [01:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=5140) so it it went back which is done url like this

- [01:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=5142) like this then what is the response

- [01:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=5151) i think the response we got is directly like this so

- [01:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=5152) like this so no visible redirection

- [01:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=5166) why i can see the response here let's also check from the

- [01:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=5172) [Music] internet explorer

- [01:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=5179) actually this is now named as h okay so um

- [01:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=5182) okay so um [Music]

- [01:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=5184) [Music] also network okay when i check it

- [01:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=5187) also network okay when i check it like this it requests this and responds

- [01:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=5193) like this it requests this and responds yeah so the response headers have

- [01:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=5195) yeah so the response headers have location like this

- [01:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=5198) location like this and the status code is

- [01:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=5202) and the status code is okay three zero two three zero two is

- [01:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=5206) okay three zero two three zero two is i think redirection

- [01:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=5211) i think redirection okay http codes

- [01:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=5217) yeah it means that found redirects the tattoos

- [01:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=5218) tattoos so basically it is returning a

- [01:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=5222) so basically it is returning a redirection to the index page after

- [01:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=5224) redirection to the index page after going to

- [01:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=5225) going to this url okay

- [01:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=5228) this url okay and it is getting updated like this so

- [01:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=5230) and it is getting updated like this so the user doesn't notice anything

- [01:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=5232) the user doesn't notice anything uh it does a full post page and full

- [01:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=5236) uh it does a full post page and full reload currently it is not is

- [01:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=5238) reload currently it is not is asynchronous

- [01:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=5240) asynchronous however it is working and then

- [01:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=5247) let's continue so we are riding items like this

- [01:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=5249) like this i think

- [01:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=5252) i think okay um it composes

- [01:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=5256) okay um it composes a tr but we don't have a beginning of

- [01:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=5259) a tr but we don't have a beginning of the table therefore we need to have

- [01:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=5261) the table therefore we need to have table beginning

- [01:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=5265) table beginning like this yeah

- [01:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=5269) like this yeah and okay so the next thing is edit

- [01:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=5273) and okay so the next thing is edit the edit will also load this page

- [01:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=5281) however we also need to display some information

- [01:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=5282) information uh when we are editing so

- [01:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=5286) uh when we are editing so let's have an h1 like um this

- [01:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=5290) let's have an h1 like um this okay so if

- [01:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=5294) okay so if if need to do

- [01:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=5297) if need to do task not need to do yeah i need to do

- [01:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=5300) task not need to do yeah i need to do tasks

- [01:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=5322) okay why it is not available okay that okay not working

- [01:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=5327) okay that okay not working i think i need to use model parameters

- [01:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=5332) i think i need to use model parameters more than that need to do test start

- [01:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=5335) more than that need to do test start id is not equal 0

- [01:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=5341) id is not equal 0 then i will type h1

- [01:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=5344) then i will type h1 and in there i will type id okay task id

- [01:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=5356) okay let's add a parenthesis like this so the task id

- [01:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=5360) parenthesis like this so the task id will be

- [01:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=5366) this like this and task description let's put it inside

- [01:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=5370) and task description let's put it inside here task description

- [01:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=5373) here task description [Music]

- [01:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=5376) [Music] then be like

- [01:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=5379) then be like this okay

- [01:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=5384) this okay and then they can use

- [01:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=5387) and then they can use this form to update

- [01:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=5390) this form to update the task

- [01:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=5397) so the value here will be changing according to our

- [01:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=5401) according to our task value how can we make it change we

- [01:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=5405) task value how can we make it change we can make it

- [01:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=5406) can make it as let's see

- [01:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=5421) okay model dot it has id equal to zero

- [01:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=5425) it has id equal to zero then okay i think we can write something

- [01:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=5429) then okay i think we can write something like this here

- [01:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=5436) okay and like this i think it will work but i'm not sure so

- [01:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=5438) i think it will work but i'm not sure so if it is zero

- [01:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=5440) if it is zero add okay new task

- [01:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=5443) add okay new task if it is not zero updates

- [01:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=5446) if it is not zero updates selected task

- [01:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=5451) selected task or update the update currently

- [01:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=5455) or update the update currently displays task yeah okay and then we can

- [01:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=5460) displays task yeah okay and then we can also

- [01:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=5461) also type task status if we want with htac

- [01:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=5469) you see the design is totally up to you but i am currently doing

- [01:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=5472) but i am currently doing [Music]

- [01:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=5479) something simple task is done status and here's

- [01:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=5486) we'll get is done to string so it's going through or false

- [01:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=5491) so it's going through or false okay so then will be this uh

- [01:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=5495) okay so then will be this uh appear it will appear when we go to the

- [01:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=5498) appear it will appear when we go to the lecture 14

- [01:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=5499) lecture 14 edit

- [01:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=5505) action so let's quote the edit action here

- [01:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=5518) by the way when we redirect the action this time we need to keep an

- [01:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=5521) this time we need to keep an existing model

- [01:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=5531) let's see what can we do how can we do it

- [01:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=5533) it i think we do it in

- [01:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=5543) lecture 13 of extra 10 controllers yeah we have done it with temp data

- [01:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=5560) okay but if stamp data was temp data for

- [01:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=5564) but if stamp data was temp data for user specific or not

- [01:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=5575) user specific or not okay you see

- [01:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=5598) okay so it is user specific so we can definitely use it

- [01:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=5601) definitely use it okay so basically in

- [01:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=5604) okay so basically in this edit action

- [01:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=5608) this edit action and a task

- [01:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=5617) edit task like this edit task what we are going to do is

- [01:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=5630) we will update the task and return back to that

- [01:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=5630) to that page

- [01:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=5635) so [Music]

- [01:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=5638) [Music] let's see what to do

- [01:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=5653) actually the task will return that item load and return that item so that it can

- [01:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=5656) load and return that item so that it can be edited

- [01:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=5663) so basically what it is going to do is we will define lecture 14

- [01:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=5666) we will define lecture 14 model

- [01:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=5678) and this will be not here we will find task item from task id like

- [01:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=5682) we will find task item from task id like here

- [01:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=5683) here if it is not null

- [01:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=5691) we will assign my model that need to do task equal to

- [01:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=5695) need to do task equal to task item by the way

- [01:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=5698) task item by the way this is from to-do list and this is from

- [01:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=5701) this is from to-do list and this is from to do task therefore

- [01:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=5704) to do task therefore i need to use my

- [01:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=5707) i need to use my [Music]

- [01:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=5710) [Music] method overloading yes

- [01:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=5714) method overloading yes yeah okay and then

- [01:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=5717) yeah okay and then we will save that inside stamp data

- [01:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=5735) i wonder if we can change the url when returning data range

- [01:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=5742) returning data range actually it is fine to have changed url

- [01:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=5745) actually it is fine to have changed url here why we why we are wasting our time

- [01:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=5749) why we why we are wasting our time so we will return we with this new model

- [01:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=5756) so we will return we with this new model yeah we can live and

- [01:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=5760) yeah we can live and index and the model will be

- [01:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=5764) index and the model will be this one okay let's

- [01:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=5768) this one okay let's test it so the url will be to change it

- [01:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=5771) test it so the url will be to change it but it is not a problem currently

- [01:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=5780) okay this is edit oh we have a problem with naming

- [01:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=5798) okay here it is now it should work

- [01:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=5831) okay you see now they are better formatted so when i

- [01:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=5833) formatted so when i click on them you see at the bottom of

- [01:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=5836) click on them you see at the bottom of the browser there is lecture 14 edit

- [01:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=5838) the browser there is lecture 14 edit task and when i click test 2 task id 5

- [01:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=5842) and when i click test 2 task id 5 6 description status 2 task is down

- [01:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=5844) 6 description status 2 task is down status through

- [01:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=5846) status through then i can enter a new task description

- [01:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=5851) then i can enter a new task description and i can update currently display tasks

- [01:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=5854) and i can update currently display tasks so

- [01:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=5855) so this last test to a task

- [01:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=5858) this last test to a task and when i click update and now

- [01:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=5862) and when i click update and now it is updated you see

- [01:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=5866) it is updated you see and it has returned in the updated task

- [01:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=5869) and it has returned in the updated task and now i am able to see that and the

- [01:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=5871) and now i am able to see that and the url is now

- [01:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=5872) url is now update insert okay

- [01:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=5883) so it is working as expected but normally you would have a navigation

- [01:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=5885) but normally you would have a navigation therefore

- [01:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=5887) therefore you would be able to return to the view

- [01:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=5891) you would be able to return to the view and let's turn to the

- [01:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=5894) and let's turn to the base

- [01:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=5901) okay it was updated but oh the update looks like didn't work let's

- [01:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=5903) the update looks like didn't work let's see why

- [01:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=5923) so update in search it is taking models okay let's see why it didn't work

- [01:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=5935) okay updated plus test2 and here the model has arrived

- [01:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=5939) and here the model has arrived so we have new task id file

- [01:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=5943) so we have new task id file iso updated test2

- [01:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=5951) okay we did fix the title as new title yeah then we go to the

- [01:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=5962) uh inside update task model so we here here we will check with

- [01:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=5965) so we here here we will check with id

- [01:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=5972) okay let's see we have id [Music]

- [01:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=5973) [Music] and vr user is not known

- [01:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=5980) and vr user is not known okay then we will overridden the

- [01:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=5983) okay then we will overridden the values like this

- [01:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=5987) values like this then we did save okay so why it is not

- [01:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=5990) then we did save okay so why it is not save it

- [01:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=6001) so our deep clone methodology didn't work for updates

- [01:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=6020) maybe i need to add it to the news okay we will figure out figure it out

- [01:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=6022) okay we will figure out figure it out but it is not working

- [01:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=6025) but it is not working so we do a new clone and then

- [01:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=6029) so we do a new clone and then we yeah it's something like this by the

- [01:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=6032) we yeah it's something like this by the way this should be a name with and we

- [01:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=6033) way this should be a name with and we are task not vr

- [01:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=6036) are task not vr users

- [01:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=6069) okay fight means python will give primary cables a connectivity between

- [01:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=6071) primary cables a connectivity between probability but it should be integrated

- [01:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=6072) probability but it should be integrated by context

- [01:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=6077) okay now it is attached i'm being tracked

- [01:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=6079) tracked and so it will just take the name task i

- [01:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=6083) and so it will just take the name task i did

- [01:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=6083) did find we don't need first or default

- [01:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=6090) find we don't need first or default okay so i think now it will work but i'm

- [01:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=6092) okay so i think now it will work but i'm not

- [01:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=6093) not i'm still not sure

- [01:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=6100) so let's let's try first let's add a new task and then

- [01:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=6101) task and then try to update it

- [01:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=6131) database handling classes frameworks libraries you are

- [01:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=6133) classes frameworks libraries you are using

- [01:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=6134) using uh it it changes how you handle the data

- [01:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=6137) uh it it changes how you handle the data so let's add s4 as a new task

- [01:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=6146) okay it is not found edit context save changes okay now

- [01:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=6150) context save changes okay now task id seven description four yeah

- [01:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=6153) task id seven description four yeah and return back

- [01:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=6160) okay it is here when we click it it is here let's try

- [01:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=6162) here let's try okay this was task 4

- [01:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=6181) yeah and then we did save changes and let's check it out okay it didn't

- [01:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=6183) and let's check it out okay it didn't say

- [01:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=6185) say so when we do clone it is not getting

- [01:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=6190) so when we do clone it is not getting updated back

- [01:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=6198) so if we edit then it will tell us that it exists therefore we need to have

- [01:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=6203) it exists therefore we need to have we need a way to copy all the values

- [01:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=6206) we need a way to copy all the values attributes

- [01:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=6215) [Music] so this is returning a new item

- [01:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=6230) of a child class to a parent last matching attributes

- [01:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=6258) so what is the proper way so we have parent child

- [01:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=6275) option okay so it uses a public class property

- [01:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=6277) okay so it uses a public class property copiers

- [01:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=6288) it is a public class static class

- [01:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=6291) public class static class [Music]

- [01:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=6293) [Music] it it uses copy method

- [01:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=6297) it it uses copy method which takes parent and child

- [01:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=6301) which takes parent and child so this will be reference type because

- [01:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=6303) so this will be reference type because they are restricted as

- [01:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=6304) they are restricted as class here this is from

- [01:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=6308) class here this is from uh generics it will take their

- [01:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=6311) uh generics it will take their properties and if the property name and

- [01:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=6313) properties and if the property name and type are matching

- [01:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=6316) type are matching it will set value it will use set value

- [01:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=6320) it will set value it will use set value so the set value is coming from

- [01:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=6329) property info reflection okay so let's try that instead of the

- [01:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=6332) okay so let's try that instead of the our method so

- [01:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=6337) our method so in here instead of using clone

- [01:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=6350) propriety copy that copy

- [01:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=6358) so property copy is expecting our classes so the first one is

- [01:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=6361) classes so the first one is parents so the parent class will be tbl

- [01:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=6365) parents so the parent class will be tbl to-do list and the child class will be

- [01:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=6368) to-do list and the child class will be to do

- [01:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=6369) to do item and it will take

- [01:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=6380) as we are tasked to parent

- [01:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=6384) to parent and child will be new task

- [01:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=6387) and child will be new task by the way i will make this to the lay

- [01:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=6389) by the way i will make this to the lay item

- [01:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=6391) item so let's also find where we have we are

- [01:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=6394) so let's also find where we have we are calling it

- [01:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=6396) calling it oh no no it can remain like that so new

- [01:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=6400) oh no no it can remain like that so new task

- [01:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=6407) and we have to do a casting like this

- [01:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=6419) okay let's try this way and see if this is working or not

- [01:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=6430) you see i can manually set uh each attribute myself as well but i'm

- [01:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=6433) uh each attribute myself as well but i'm trying a more generic version

- [01:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=6436) trying a more generic version so if i add more attributes to my class

- [01:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=6438) so if i add more attributes to my class in future

- [01:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=6440) in future i won't spend time uh

- [01:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=6443) i won't spend time uh to add them as well to this method

- [01:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=6446) to add them as well to this method this is the more generic approach more

- [01:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=6449) this is the more generic approach more generalized approach which is much

- [01:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=6451) generalized approach which is much better

- [01:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=6453) better test 44 let's try

- [01:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=6457) test 44 let's try so you see we are task has test 4 and

- [01:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=6460) so you see we are task has test 4 and new task has 44

- [01:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=6464) new task has 44 when we copy all properties uh now we

- [01:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=6468) when we copy all properties uh now we are

- [01:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=6468) are okay it didn't work

- [01:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=6486) so parents or here's part properties id chat properties same

- [01:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=6490) id chat properties same and then chart properties if they're

- [01:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=6494) and then chart properties if they're equal id id

- [01:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=6503) let's get here okay properties id pet date

- [01:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=6507) okay properties id pet date title yeah so child property set by your

- [01:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=6511) title yeah so child property set by your child

- [01:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=6512) child is 44

- [01:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=6535) and so the proper child property what is that

- [01:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=6536) that it is title yeah so it should set

- [01:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=6540) it is title yeah so it should set earlier

- [01:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=6546) like this okay title is set to 44

- [01:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=6550) is set to 44 in the child's

- [01:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=6569) so it will set value of parent to the child in this method

- [01:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=6580) so we will change it as copy child to parents current

- [01:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=6583) child to parents current and we will change the order as

- [01:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=6587) and we will change the order as like this okay copy child to parents

- [01:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=6594) like this okay copy child to parents oh it should work yeah

- [01:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=6600) so the order was opposite and i have modified it according to our application

- [01:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=6635) okay after copying oh object does not match

- [01:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=6652) because it is using child's property i have to use part

- [01:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=6653) have to use part property for this to work

- [01:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=6657) property for this to work let's restart and try again

- [01:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=6695) okay and after we copy

- [01:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=6698) and after we copy yeah now the title is set and after we

- [01:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=6701) yeah now the title is set and after we saved okay an error could go up then

- [01:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=6705) saved okay an error could go up then we're going to see

- [01:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=6706) we're going to see the exception

- [01:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=6719) why the date is set like this and

- [01:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=6724) set like this and that is the problematic thing because

- [01:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=6727) that is the problematic thing because the date is coming

- [01:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=6729) the date is coming incorrect from here

- [01:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=6748) okay why we are having a date problem

- [01:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=6765) i think let's try to debug from here so in our model the date is set

- [01:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=6771) so in our model the date is set correct so i need to

- [01:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=6776) correct so i need to stand back other data as well

- [01:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=6789) so in here when i do update i only send back

- [01:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=6790) back uh the id as hidden i also need to send

- [01:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=6794) uh the id as hidden i also need to send back

- [01:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=6795) back date as well otherwise it will be

- [01:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=6799) date as well otherwise it will be changed

- [01:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=6817) and if i add a new value i also need to modify this method which i don't want

- [01:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=6834) i think in update new task method

- [01:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=6850) yeah so this will copy all parameters instead of that we can just copy title

- [01:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=6855) instead of that we can just copy title we have returned back to our

- [01:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=6863) beginning okay this uh blue method

- [01:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=6866) okay this uh blue method copies all attributes

- [01:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=6871) copies all attributes so if you use this

- [01:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=6874) so if you use this approach you have to

- [01:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=6885) post fake all attributes of item in a hidden

- [01:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=6889) of item in a hidden so i will keep this method

- [01:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=6893) so i will keep this method to make it work so to be able to make it

- [01:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=6897) to make it work so to be able to make it work we need to post back

- [01:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=6906) dates and you also need to pause with by the way

- [01:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=6907) the way since this will be a hidden we don't

- [01:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=6910) since this will be a hidden we don't need any of this

- [01:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=6913) need any of this and this

- [01:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=6919) and we also need to prospect ease boolean

- [01:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=6926) like this and now it will work alternatively i could only set

- [01:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=6934) um i could only set the title of the item

- [01:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=6936) item and i wouldn't be in need to

- [01:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=6939) and i wouldn't be in need to postpone attributes

- [01:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=6942) postpone attributes so this approach is not good right now

- [01:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=6945) so this approach is not good right now for our

- [01:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=6953) application but in order to show you that it is working

- [01:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=6956) that it is working i will make an example like this

- [01:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=6965) okay okay now updated let's check database

- [01:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=6973) so alternatively we could also do something like this let me show you

- [01:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=6993) this below from post-face all of the attributes of model

- [01:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=6997) attributes of model to update in database

- [01:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=7008) and let's add another method to only update title

- [01:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=7017) or space only title and id to update in database so this time we will

- [01:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=7021) in database so this time we will call task version 2

- [01:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=7024) call task version 2 we don't need this anymore

- [01:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=7032) and let's go to task version 2 as well in our controller

- [01:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=7044) which is here okay version two version two

- [01:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=7048) okay version two version two version two and it will use

- [01:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=7052) version two and it will use add update task version two

- [01:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=7077) the title equal to a new task that title yeah that's it and nothing else

- [01:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=7085) okay you can use both ways but they have their

- [01:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=7097) when we run now we should both they should work

- [01:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=7112) we should also able to see hidden attributes

- [01:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=7129) okay so it displays add tasks right now and add tasks they are same but now it

- [01:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=7133) and add tasks they are same but now it is like

- [01:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=7134) is like uh update currently uh display task

- [01:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=7139) uh update currently uh display task and in the second method we have only

- [01:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=7141) and in the second method we have only one hidden value

- [01:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=7142) one hidden value and in the first approach we will have

- [01:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=7145) and in the first approach we will have all

- [01:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=7146) all attributes as hidden here

- [01:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=7150) attributes as hidden here you see the value of datetime here only

- [01:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=7154) you see the value of datetime here only is done here so let's try this

- [01:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=7157) is done here so let's try this [Music]

- [01:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=7159) [Music] let's update it and yes it is updated

- [01:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=7172) all right so now that we can abort save and now uh

- [01:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=7176) abort save and now uh the delete uh item we will code that

- [01:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=7181) the delete uh item we will code that and on delete we will ask

- [01:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=7184) and on delete we will ask for validation

- [01:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=7187) for validation to are you sure

- [01:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=7190) to are you sure so here let's see

- [02:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=7200) okay here the delete by the way for checkbox we are using this on click

- [02:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=7202) for checkbox we are using this on click javascript function

- [02:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=7204) javascript function and for delete we will use return

- [02:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=7206) and for delete we will use return confirm

- [02:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=7207) confirm javascript function

- [02:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=7214) for deleting let's also compose a delete method it also takes item id

- [02:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=7218) a delete method it also takes item id simply

- [02:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=7227) okay in lecture 14 controllers we will simply use

- [02:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=7230) we will simply use delete

- [02:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=7246) okay delete and task id task

- [02:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=7251) task id task okay let's say it has three tasks by the

- [02:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=7253) okay let's say it has three tasks by the way these

- [02:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=7254) way these two doesn't have to be same so don't get

- [02:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=7256) two doesn't have to be same so don't get confused

- [02:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=7258) confused so if it is not null um

- [02:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=7261) so if it is not null um [Music]

- [02:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=7262) [Music] how we gonna delete maybe this

- [02:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=7266) how we gonna delete maybe this have delete okay there is remove

- [02:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=7271) have delete okay there is remove so the remove takes entity yeah

- [02:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=7284) it will be like this and we will say say changes

- [02:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=7290) and then we can redirect to index page like this

- [02:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=7296) redirect to index page like this okay let's see

- [02:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=7303) by the way this is still fully uh synchronous

- [02:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=7305) synchronous and i will also i am planning to also

- [02:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=7308) and i will also i am planning to also show you how to

- [02:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=7311) show you how to code them as asynchronous with jquery

- [02:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=7338) show how to do a custom authentication system i will also show you that how can

- [02:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=7341) system i will also show you that how can you make a custom

- [02:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=7343) you make a custom login system authentication system so

- [02:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=7345) login system authentication system so let's try delete so it says

- [02:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=7347) let's try delete so it says are you sure by the way we can add more

- [02:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=7349) are you sure by the way we can add more information regarding to that

- [02:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=7352) information regarding to that how can we do it we can do it as are you

- [02:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=7355) how can we do it we can do it as are you sure

- [02:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=7356) sure to delete

- [02:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=7364) item description let's edit so here we will add item dot

- [02:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=7368) so here we will add item dot title

- [02:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=7375) and we can also add a quotation mark like this with escape characters

- [02:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=7387) okay our escape character didn't work well maybe

- [02:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=7388) well maybe double characters oh

- [02:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=7394) double characters oh anyway we don't need that

- [02:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=7402) okay are you sure to delete okay title

- [02:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=7414) yeah interesting autocomplete is not working

- [02:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=7423) okay by the way this may also break your uh alert message if

- [02:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=7426) also break your uh alert message if title has

- [02:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=7428) title has some uh incorrect

- [02:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=7431) some uh incorrect characters i mean some characters that

- [02:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=7434) characters i mean some characters that need to be encoded

- [02:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=7436) need to be encoded so it may break your this delete

- [02:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=7441) so it may break your this delete confirm message you have to be careful

- [02:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=7443) confirm message you have to be careful with that

- [02:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=7466) return confirm are you sure the message is not printed as we want

- [02:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=7471) the message is not printed as we want this was supposed to be a single message

- [02:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=7474) this was supposed to be a single message but it is

- [02:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=7475) but it is not so

- [02:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=7478) not so let's compose this as a sitting at

- [02:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=7482) let's compose this as a sitting at somewhere

- [02:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=7483) somewhere for example

- [02:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=7530) how can we encode it we need to escape we need to escape with

- [02:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=7531) we need to escape with escape characters okay there is html and

- [02:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=7535) escape characters okay there is html and code

- [02:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=7542) there is javascript and code http utility

- [02:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=7556) yeah this looks like the case so it's message will be equal to

- [02:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=7562) so it's message will be equal to http utility and code

- [02:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=7570) okay so this is not existing in our library

- [02:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=7575) in our library maybe we need to add it to our

- [02:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=7578) maybe we need to add it to our references

- [02:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=7605) maybe we need to add it to our weave import file

- [02:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=7607) import file let's find it

- [02:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=7631) okay so what namespace [Music]

- [02:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=7660) oh let's try this so this can also work

- [02:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=7663) so this can also work some web not urlcon

- [02:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=7666) some web not urlcon and codeparts

- [02:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=7669) and codeparts html and code maybe this this can work

- [02:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=7684) oh just group encode is now here so basically it is inside system http

- [02:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=7688) so basically it is inside system http utility and then

- [02:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=7692) utility and then we will use this

- [02:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=7695) we will use this as a confirm message okay let's try

- [02:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=7699) as a confirm message okay let's try as this way

- [02:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=7740) call from let message interesting oh i know the reason i know the reason

- [02:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=7743) know the reason i know the reason uh because this is

- [02:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=7746) uh because this is not parsed as a string now it will be

- [02:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=7766) i may also be needed to use html and raw but

- [02:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=7767) but let's test first

- [02:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=7783) okay on click confirm are you sure to delete tests

- [02:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=7785) delete tests when i click ok i think i know the

- [02:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=7787) when i click ok i think i know the reason now

- [02:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=7793) i also need to append this to the beginning and to the end

- [02:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=7796) this to the beginning and to the end now i'm pretty sure it will work by the

- [02:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=7800) now i'm pretty sure it will work by the way delete is working

- [02:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=7801) way delete is working we are only not getting the javascript

- [02:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=7809) method getting executed you see or they are all deleted

- [02:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=7833) yes now asking you see are you sure to delete this one

- [02:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=7834) delete this one okay let's also try some invalid

- [02:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=7837) okay let's also try some invalid uh character having title such as

- [02:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=7842) uh character having title such as such as some invalid charts

- [02:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=7852) i wonder if this will work as a new task it is added now let's return back to the

- [02:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=7857) it is added now let's return back to the root okay it is something like this as

- [02:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=7861) root okay it is something like this as you see

- [02:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=7863) you see and yeah yeah it is escaped

- [02:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=7867) and yeah yeah it is escaped yeah it is working great it is working

- [02:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=7871) yeah it is working great it is working and now i can delete it yes

- [02:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=7874) and now i can delete it yes okay so let's take a note of what we

- [02:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=7877) okay so let's take a note of what we have

- [02:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=7878) have seen so far in this lecture

- [02:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=7898) in lecture 14. okay so

- [02:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=7904) um [Music]

- [02:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=7907) [Music] okay um

- [02:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=7912) okay um also okay let's say how to fully

- [02:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=7915) also okay let's say how to fully push back the model to update

- [02:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=7920) push back the model to update entity changes in the database

- [02:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=7925) entity changes in the database also partying when i see how to

- [02:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=7929) also partying when i see how to push back necessity

- [02:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=7932) push back necessity or an entity to update

- [02:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=7936) or an entity to update changes in the database

- [02:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=7945) how to do database operations such as insert update

- [02:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=7948) such as insert update delete select in

- [02:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=7955) mss for database with using entity framework

- [02:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=7966) in s dot net for five permission

- [02:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=7969) five permission application

- [02:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=7975) okay uh how to clone object uh values

- [02:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=7980) object uh values or let's say how to how to do a deep

- [02:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=7984) or let's say how to how to do a deep colon of an object with

- [02:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=7987) colon of an object with object instance with

- [02:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=7996) let's also note that json converts serialize

- [02:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=8001) json converts serialize and deselect

- [02:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=8004) and deselect object how to copy values

- [02:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=8007) object how to copy values of all how to copy all

- [02:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=8011) of all how to copy all values of all properties of an

- [02:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=8015) values of all properties of an object instance

- [02:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=8018) object instance into another object with

- [02:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=8024) into another object with uh property copier customer

- [02:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=8029) uh property copier customer was okay

- [02:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=8038) what were these fields yeah it should work

- [02:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=8039) work no if you make fields uh this wouldn't

- [02:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=8041) no if you make fields uh this wouldn't work actually

- [02:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=8043) work actually because this is you based on properties

- [02:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=8046) because this is you based on properties so if you make fields it may not work

- [02:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=8048) so if you make fields it may not work i'm not sure

- [02:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=8049) i'm not sure so i won't write it and

- [02:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=8081) scene in lecture 14. okay now uh we can start

- [02:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=8085) okay now uh we can start working on making these as

- [02:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=8088) working on making these as asynchronous okay with jquery currently

- [02:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=8091) asynchronous okay with jquery currently whatever we do

- [02:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=8092) whatever we do is all full of synchronous for example

- [02:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=8096) is all full of synchronous for example example when i add task you see it is

- [02:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=8100) example when i add task you see it is doing a full

- [02:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=8100) doing a full prospect and full

- [02:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=8104) prospect and full refresh you see it like this what i want

- [02:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=8107) refresh you see it like this what i want to do

- [02:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=8108) to do is i want to add and remove with um

- [02:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=8117) jquery so i see that that mvcg created ajax okay

- [02:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=8121) ajax okay let's find some examples related to that

- [02:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=8160) work with html as well

- [02:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=8169) i think we can work with partial waves if we use

- [02:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=8202) we are iterating the model and printing it like this right

- [02:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=8203) it like this right however if we do an ajax post

- [02:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=8207) however if we do an ajax post we wouldn't be able to

- [02:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=8210) we wouldn't be able to get this here so first

- [02:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=8221) put this into a partial view and return that i think i will start

- [02:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=8224) and return that i think i will start with another

- [02:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=8225) with another uh

- [02:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=8232) weave and controller for this task so let's add another index

- [02:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=8236) so let's add another index as ajax

- [02:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=8245) at lecture 14 ajax ajax index or let's call it as

- [02:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=8249) ajax index or let's call it as yeah ajax is fine

- [02:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=8258) and i'm also going to have methods for this ajax index

- [02:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=8269) so in our controller lecture 14 um this is the default route

- [02:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=8273) um this is the default route and it returns index by default

- [02:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=8284) so what we need to do is we need to have ajax index here

- [02:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=8291) we need to have ajax index here and inside ajax index we will call ajax

- [02:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=8294) and inside ajax index we will call ajax index

- [02:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=8296) index and we need to also set a root for this

- [02:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=8300) and we need to also set a root for this so root it will a lot

- [02:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=8303) so root it will a lot like uh lecture 14 ajax here

- [02:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=8312) and in ajax index let's open it

- [02:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=8319) let's open it okay we will use partial view to

- [02:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=8322) okay we will use partial view to parse it so

- [02:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=8352) for the partial view we will require our model

- [02:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=8354) model therefore we need to provide our model

- [02:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=8358) therefore we need to provide our model inside partial view

- [02:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=8375) okay so let's add a partial view actually instead of partial use we can

- [02:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=8377) actually instead of partial use we can use

- [02:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=8452) difference between introduction and [Music]

- [02:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=8469) okay partially result employee partial leave

- [02:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=8470) leave employee

- [02:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=8576) this is a pretty old article i think i will use this

- [02:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=8600) yeah i think i will give full path or not getting completed

- [02:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=8602) not getting completed so ins here we are going to have a

- [02:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=8604) so ins here we are going to have a default view

- [02:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=8606) default view there is no defining as partial and i

- [02:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=8608) there is no defining as partial and i will name it as

- [02:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=8610) will name it as lists

- [02:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=8613) lists items or let's say list

- [02:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=8615) items or let's say list [Music]

- [02:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=8617) [Music] task items

- [02:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=8627) okay and okay in here we will call

- [02:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=8631) okay in here we will call radiator parcel asynchronous it will be

- [02:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=8633) radiator parcel asynchronous it will be under leaves

- [02:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=8635) under leaves picture 14

- [02:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=8638) picture 14 and let's also name it as it's

- [02:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=8643) and let's also name it as it's regular conversion like this

- [02:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=8654) okay and in here we will get model

- [02:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=8669) picture nine model start lecture 14 and

- [02:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=8680) okay that is our regular page which is here i will move this

- [02:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=8684) which is here i will move this to this item

- [02:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=8688) to this item and i will call it

- [02:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=8693) and i will call it in our regular page as well as a partial

- [02:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=8696) in our regular page as well as a partial view

- [02:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=8702) okay so i will be able to use it both in ajax

- [02:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=8705) i will be able to use it both in ajax and here

- [02:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=8706) and here and i also need to provide the model as

- [02:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=8721) okay and yeah so let's first try whether it is

- [02:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=8724) yeah so let's first try whether it is being

- [02:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=8725) being printed on our regular root page or not

- [02:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=8729) printed on our regular root page or not then we can move to the

- [02:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=8730) then we can move to the asynchronous operations

- [02:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=8750) you see that partial wave is not dependent on the controller

- [02:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=8753) dependent on the controller it just takes model and then we can

- [02:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=8758) it just takes model and then we can use it as we want

- [02:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=8764) okay we have an error let's check our errors

- [02:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=8774) tbl low error locks and in here's

- [02:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=8777) and in here's what is our error oh it is not

- [02:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=8781) what is our error oh it is not located here

- [02:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=8789) oh it is logos here yeah this is the partial leave and message

- [02:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=8793) partial leave and message so it says that it is not found

- [02:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=8797) so it says that it is not found we use lecture ah i see

- [02:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=8805) uh we have given incorrect folder name yeah lecture 14.

- [02:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=8808) yeah lecture 14. that's restart you see logging errors is

- [02:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=8811) that's restart you see logging errors is extremely

- [02:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=8813) extremely convenient and efficient uh with

- [02:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=8816) convenient and efficient uh with from the errors i just look at which

- [02:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=8818) from the errors i just look at which error is new and

- [02:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=8820) error is new and i have found a reason without

- [02:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=8824) i have found a reason without debugging we have

- [02:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=8827) debugging we have coded this error logging system in our

- [02:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=8829) coded this error logging system in our previous lectures

- [02:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=8831) previous lectures if you wonder that

- [02:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=8837) if you wonder that okay we still have an error let's see

- [02:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=8849) okay so where is that partial asynchronous

- [02:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=8850) asynchronous object model

- [02:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=8863) it says that it wasn't found interesting oh we also call this we have fix it

- [02:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=8866) oh we also call this we have fix it in correct ways we need to fix actually

- [02:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=8870) in correct ways we need to fix actually lecture 14 english html first

- [02:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=8873) lecture 14 english html first yeah sorry about that

- [02:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=8879) yeah sorry about that let's also delete existing logs

- [02:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=8890) okay and let's see if any new error cost or not

- [02:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=8911) okay so it is uh very well working let's add some test one

- [02:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=8916) working let's add some test one and new task okay it is added

- [02:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=8919) and new task okay it is added let's return back yeah working okay so

- [02:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=8923) let's return back yeah working okay so let's also test

- [02:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=8924) let's also test our new ajax page

- [02:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=8928) our new ajax page which is lecture 14

- [02:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=8931) which is lecture 14 ajax let's add to the bookmark so we can

- [02:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=8934) ajax let's add to the bookmark so we can quickly access it

- [02:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=8936) quickly access it and yeah it is also as you see it is

- [02:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=8939) and yeah it is also as you see it is also

- [02:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=8940) also printed and what am i going to do

- [02:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=8944) printed and what am i going to do is i am going to add

- [02:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=8947) is i am going to add a form method that will add a new task

- [02:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=8951) a form method that will add a new task but with ajax script

- [02:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=8954) but with ajax script okay uh so i started mvc4

- [02:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=8958) okay uh so i started mvc4 into ajax

- [02:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=8964) okay so let's see if there is an easier game

- [02:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=8974) so we have using ajax begin for new ajax options

- [02:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=8988) okay so it is using ajax speaking for

- [02:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=8991) ajax speaking for new address options update target id

- [02:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=9020) this example is further incomplete but i think i have an idea what is it

- [02:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=9024) but i think i have an idea what is it about

- [02:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=9033) okay let's see so there is ajax begin form

- [02:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=9037) so there is ajax begin form and then we write our regular formula

- [02:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=9039) and then we write our regular formula very nice

- [02:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=9041) very nice it turns that into ajax i think

- [02:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=9091) and that's this from the top to get more idea

- [02:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=9092) idea this is a pretty recent article

- [02:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=9101) razer view engine offers many ui controls which eases the processing of

- [02:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=9103) controls which eases the processing of many ui components when using an

- [02:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=9105) many ui components when using an integration with the server side

- [02:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=9108) integration with the server side ajax form control is one of many ui

- [02:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=9110) ajax form control is one of many ui controls

- [02:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=9111) controls which is being offered by razer view

- [02:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=9113) which is being offered by razer view engine

- [02:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=9115) engine today i shall be demonstrating the usage

- [02:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=9117) today i shall be demonstrating the usage of razer view engine control ie ajax

- [02:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=9119) of razer view engine control ie ajax form control with asp.net mvc5 platform

- [02:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=9124) form control with asp.net mvc5 platform following are some prerequisites before

- [02:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=9126) following are some prerequisites before you proceed further in this tutorial we

- [02:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=9129) you proceed further in this tutorial we already have them

- [02:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=9136) you can download okay we don't need that so there's layout file which we don't

- [02:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=9139) so there's layout file which we don't need

- [02:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=9141) need we have our scripts before

- [02:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=9144) we have our scripts before we need jquery and obtrusive attacks

- [02:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=9148) we need jquery and obtrusive attacks library

- [02:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=9155) into our project and we need to edit references

- [02:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=9163) like here registers bundle okay there are a lot of

- [02:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=9169) bundle okay there are a lot of things here

- [02:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=9186) i'm ready to participate so this is our controllers yeah there is nothing

- [02:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=9189) controllers yeah there is nothing fancy here so let's install this

- [02:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=9193) fancy here so let's install this and edit to the bundle thing inside our

- [02:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=9200) bundle how we're going to do that is

- [02:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=9209) so bundle means it will turn that into a bundle then we can

- [02:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=9210) bundle then we can link it in our vegan portal beer

- [02:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=9214) link it in our vegan portal beer i think let's see

- [02:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=9215) i think let's see [Music]

- [02:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=9218) [Music] where did they do it

- [02:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=9229) okay so what is the name it is jquery odd

- [02:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=9230) odd obtrusive on altruism yeah

- [02:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=9234) obtrusive on altruism yeah let's add that to our project

- [02:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=9241) we can also write [Music]

- [02:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=9253) api and use that as a

- [02:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=9257) use that as a prospect and read values

- [02:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=9260) prospect and read values but you can also use ajax as well

- [02:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=9270) but you can also use ajax as well i mean web service maybe we should

- [02:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=9274) i mean web service maybe we should use the web service for or

- [02:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=9281) use the classical form i think i will use the easy one

- [02:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=9290) so let's add a jquery on altruism

- [02:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=9295) okay it is here in close object with automatic ajax

- [02:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=9298) automatic ajax let's edit and which dependencies it

- [02:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=9300) let's edit and which dependencies it will add

- [02:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=9307) so it has added an after the jquery 1 8 0

- [02:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=9327) okay and we need to bundle them

- [02:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=9358) let's open the folders we have

- [02:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=9368) we have for parties control no

- [02:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=9382) inside of double roots perhaps this is what we use

- [02:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=9419) basically this is just a ajax begin form i wonder if this is directly past valid

- [02:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=9424) i wonder if this is directly past valid in our application

- [02:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=9453) okay it says it is not existing so i will find this

- [02:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=9455) will find this as a static and and then edit

- [02:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=9458) as a static and and then edit instead of installing a nuget package

- [02:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=9472) you see here it is adding the edge bundles

- [02:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=9474) bundles but instead of bundling i will just

- [02:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=9482) and it's as a cdn let's find it it's syrian

- [02:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=9486) let's find it it's syrian what is it is

- [02:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=9496) okay so you see jquery ajax and opt on optrusive and there is the cdn

- [02:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=9501) on optrusive and there is the cdn link let's link it and add it to the rv

- [02:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=9506) link let's link it and add it to the rv start file here

- [02:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=9511) start file here okay so i will edit out the jquery

- [02:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=9522) src okay and then

- [02:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=9535) okay ajax begin form is still not available

- [02:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=9555) we need to add reference i did add that reference but i am still not seeing that

- [02:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=9578) okay we did edit [Music]

- [02:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=9593) interesting we have the same and notepad

- [02:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=9639) oh it says it is not supported in darkness but instead as the networking

- [02:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=9649) information so we need to use data ajax method

- [02:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=9653) so we need to use data ajax method i see

- [02:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=9663) i see okay so this is the correct article that

- [02:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=9665) okay so this is the correct article that we need to

- [02:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=9666) we need to look for data ajax i see

- [02:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=9677) for method post data ajax true oh it is this much easier than oh nice

- [02:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=9682) oh it is this much easier than oh nice so let's copy and paste our

- [02:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=9685) so let's copy and paste our form into here

- [02:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=9696) and this time we will set data ajax true

- [02:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=9701) ajax true okay why not working

- [02:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=9722) um oh i know the reason because we didn't set the

- [02:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=9724) didn't set the model although that's

- [02:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=9727) model although that's lecture nine dots

- [02:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=9733) lecture nine dots okay and

- [02:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=9745) okay then there are other things you see data ajax confirm

- [02:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=9748) data ajax confirm yes or sets the message to display in a

- [02:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=9749) yes or sets the message to display in a confirmation window before the request

- [02:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=9751) confirmation window before the request is submitted

- [02:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=9753) is submitted data redux method so the data ajax

- [02:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=9756) data redux method so the data ajax method will be

- [02:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=9758) method will be paused

- [02:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=9765) like this let's also add that and then we have data ajax mode

- [02:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=9786) i think we can also set this as data ajax loading and

- [02:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=9789) as data ajax loading and it tells the guest or sets id attribute

- [02:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=9791) it tells the guest or sets id attribute of an html element that is displayed

- [02:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=9794) of an html element that is displayed while ajax is

- [02:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=9797) while ajax is loading so let's set an html element as

- [02:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=9802) loading so let's set an html element as id

- [02:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=9809) loading okay morning now

- [02:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=9817) and maybe style visibility

- [02:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=9837) okay gets or sets the name of javascript function to call

- [02:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=9838) function to call immediately before the page is updated

- [02:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=9841) immediately before the page is updated yes so this will be

- [02:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=9843) yes so this will be executed before running complete

- [02:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=9859) and then there is a function to pull after page is successfully updated

- [02:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=9864) [Music] and then there is guess or sets the id

- [02:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=9867) and then there is guess or sets the id of dom element

- [02:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=9869) of dom element to update by using the response

- [02:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=9891) what we need to do is we need to refresh this part so

- [02:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=9896) this part so how can we do it

- [02:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=9998) so url action takes action string controllers

- [02:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=9999) controllers what other options there are

- [02:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=10003) what other options there are okay url action is a method of mvc

- [02:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=10006) okay url action is a method of mvc routing

- [02:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=10006) routing action content string action

- [02:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=10010) action content string action string

- [02:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=10011) string [Music]

- [02:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=10014) [Music] protocol as a support routing

- [02:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=10040) okay so for returning this i need to have

- [02:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=10062) list task items okay and this is the pad

- [02:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=10067) okay and this is the pad so i need to provide it

- [02:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=10076) okay url action for the first parameter is

- [02:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=10084) string action action controllers action controller and t model values we

- [02:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=10087) action controller and t model values we don't have any t

- [02:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=10088) don't have any t model values therefore we will just

- [02:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=10091) model values therefore we will just provide

- [02:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=10093) provide action name the action name will be

- [02:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=10097) action name the action name will be ajax index the controller will be

- [02:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=10102) ajax index the controller will be lecture 14

- [02:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=10112) and rtlv result function so this will be the

- [02:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=10116) result function so this will be the result uh

- [02:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=10119) result uh that will be that we will get foreign

- [02:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=10139) and we also need to return partial wave action result here let's also fix that

- [02:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=10144) action result here let's also fix that okay and return partially

- [02:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=10153) okay and here's we need to have an id of something

- [02:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=10157) we need to have an id of something whatever it is

- [02:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=10161) whatever it is or let's say list of tasks

- [02:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=10165) or let's say list of tasks of course visibility once we hit them

- [02:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=10168) of course visibility once we hit them and we will get them inside here

- [02:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=10179) ajax index so the id will be this yeah so this will run as soon as the

- [02:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=10183) yeah so this will run as soon as the page is

- [02:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=10185) page is loaded

- [02:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=10194) and once it is completed it should be here

- [02:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=10200) why i am doing it this way so that i can replace it

- [02:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=10201) replace it after doing ajax postback

- [02:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=10205) after doing ajax postback without doing any full page prospects

- [02:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=10215) after this is completed i will rerun this method actually

- [02:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=10232) okay it is working so let's give this a thought name as function

- [02:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=10236) a thought name as function lords list of

- [02:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=10239) lords list of items

- [02:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=10246) my javascript is also not very good actually

- [02:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=10248) actually and we will call this method after

- [02:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=10253) and we will call this method after use

- [02:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=10273) it was a self executing function so this is a self executing function

- [02:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=10275) so this is a self executing function here

- [02:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=10277) here and now i have encapsulated it inside

- [02:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=10279) and now i have encapsulated it inside the

- [02:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=10280) the name it function and calling that

- [02:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=10283) name it function and calling that function here

- [02:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=10285) function here and

- [02:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=10292) let's open it okay it is working when we refresh the page

- [02:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=10296) it is working when we refresh the page we are seeing the ajax query here as you

- [02:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=10299) we are seeing the ajax query here as you can see

- [02:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=10301) can see actually this is not the agent's query

- [02:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=10304) actually this is not the agent's query oh it is data square yeah

- [02:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=10312) this is going ajax index okay and

- [02:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=10320) then ajax index we need to open ajax in excel

- [02:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=10324) ajax index we need to open ajax in excel this is not a page

- [02:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=10341) yeah we don't have that yet let's open ajax index

- [02:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=10350) index and this will be ajax listing so let's fix

- [02:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=10354) listing so let's fix it so here's nothing

- [02:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=10361) it so here's nothing okay ajax listing and

- [02:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=10366) okay ajax listing and here let's put ajax index

- [02:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=10371) here let's put ajax index it for the return ajax index page

- [02:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=10376) it for the return ajax index page another partially but a full wheel

- [02:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=10391) return i will return off so the ajax index is taking

- [02:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=10394) index is taking a model yeah

- [02:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=10397) a model yeah okay it is fine when we are taking

- [02:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=10419) application test you know why i didn't

- [02:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=10424) test you know why i didn't send ajax in the uh

- [02:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=10427) send ajax in the uh loaded model because we are not going to

- [02:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=10430) loaded model because we are not going to do any

- [02:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=10431) do any editing directly on that form

- [02:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=10435) editing directly on that form we will just do a post pack

- [02:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=10439) we will just do a post pack therefore an empty model is fine for us

- [02:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=10448) okay i also need to send an i empty model because we are doing a binding

- [02:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=10450) model because we are doing a binding here

- [02:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=10451) here uh so that we can

- [02:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=10459) do adding new things and it is also listed here

- [02:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=10478) form data juxt method is complete right now

- [02:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=10479) now um because we are using a speed

- [02:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=10483) um because we are using a speed float i wonder if it is turned

- [02:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=10487) float i wonder if it is turned into beta ajax url

- [02:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=10495) okay this page is still working with ajax and let's open ajax index

- [02:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=10530) listing or because it's in the lecture 14 year

- [02:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=10538) you see when you don't type the strings fully correct it won't work

- [02:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=10541) fully correct it won't work oh its root is different

- [02:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=10555) if it doesn't work i will just provide the rows parameters

- [02:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=10573) okay now working so when i set uh the controller name and the action

- [02:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=10576) uh the controller name and the action name it is working

- [02:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=10579) name it is working okay and let's check our form to see if

- [02:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=10582) okay and let's check our form to see if it is

- [02:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=10583) it is asynchronous or not ajax or not so we

- [02:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=10586) asynchronous or not ajax or not so we have

- [02:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=10587) have form data ajax for methods that ajax

- [02:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=10590) form data ajax for methods that ajax true data is

- [02:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=10591) true data is loading action loading action is lecture

- [02:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=10594) loading action loading action is lecture 14 update insert

- [02:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=10598) 14 update insert okay once this is completed we need to

- [02:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=10604) okay once this is completed we need to uh let's see when we

- [02:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=10607) uh let's see when we call it we have an error perhaps

- [02:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=10610) call it we have an error perhaps oh they are added nice nice it is

- [02:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=10613) oh they are added nice nice it is working but it is not getting refreshed

- [02:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=10615) working but it is not getting refreshed because we didn't set the refresh method

- [02:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=10619) because we didn't set the refresh method so basically when on completed

- [02:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=10623) so basically when on completed which is written here we will call our

- [02:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=10625) which is written here we will call our javascript method

- [02:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=10629) javascript method so let's add this as a command to here

- [02:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=10643) yeah like this and then on complete which is here data

- [02:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=10646) and then on complete which is here data success

- [02:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=10653) actually this is data ajax gets or sets the id of dom

- [02:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=10656) the id of dom where is the javascript function

- [02:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=10672) later ajax begin okay here when it is completed so what i need to

- [02:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=10676) when it is completed so what i need to do is data ajax complete equal to

- [02:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=10680) is data ajax complete equal to let's see it doesn't show

- [02:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=10683) let's see it doesn't show loads list of items i think it will work

- [02:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=10686) loads list of items i think it will work now

- [02:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=10698) write a console whiteline

- [02:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=10714) let's call it yeah let's run application so after prospect

- [02:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=10718) let's run application so after prospect it should be called

- [02:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=10720) it should be called and it should update our list

- [02:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=10724) and it should update our list we can also display a confirmation i

- [02:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=10727) we can also display a confirmation i also want to

- [02:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=10730) also want to display loading now message and

- [02:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=10733) display loading now message and so in order to check that we need to add

- [02:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=10736) so in order to check that we need to add a delay

- [02:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=10736) a delay to our controller

- [02:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=10740) to our controller which is here yeah if i put a breakpoint

- [02:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=10743) which is here yeah if i put a breakpoint here

- [02:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=10744) here it will add a delay

- [02:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=10748) it will add a delay so this is

- [02:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=10751) so this is ajax test

- [02:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=10755) ajax test okay and do you see loading anywhere no

- [02:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=10765) okay loading is not visible anywhere we will work on that no problem and yes

- [02:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=10769) work on that no problem and yes it is arrived so let me show you you

- [02:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=10772) it is arrived so let me show you you will see that there is no page refresh

- [02:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=10775) will see that there is no page refresh or full postback okay

- [02:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=10778) full postback okay and nice working let's

- [02:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=10781) and nice working let's edit okay the page didn't

- [02:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=10785) edit okay the page didn't refresh or post break um

- [02:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=10789) refresh or post break um let's see that is the query

- [02:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=10794) let's see that is the query requests

- [03:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=10802) okay you see this is uh called as a post uh the update insert it was an

- [03:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=10806) uh the update insert it was an asynchronous post link

- [03:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=10808) asynchronous post link and then we have ajax squared request

- [03:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=10812) and then we have ajax squared request get

- [03:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=10812) get this was also an ajax get so there

- [03:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=10815) this was also an ajax get so there weren't any page

- [03:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=10817) weren't any page changes or anything

- [03:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=10821) changes or anything i wonder if the red is also working okay

- [03:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=10824) i wonder if the red is also working okay after delete

- [03:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=10826) after delete it did a full post page so delete didn't

- [03:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=10829) it did a full post page so delete didn't work because on delete

- [03:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=10832) work because on delete let's see

- [03:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=10845) doing a full uh redirection here delete is a

- [03:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=10848) uh redirection here delete is a redirection another

- [03:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=10850) redirection another ajax right now but

- [03:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=10853) ajax right now but this is working

- [03:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=10860) okay so let's also turn uh delete

- [03:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=10865) also turn uh delete into an ajax as well

- [03:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=10880) to be able to do that we need to modify this

- [03:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=10905) there are also callback functions here we are already doing stages complete

- [03:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=10907) we are already doing stages complete covet function

- [03:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=10910) covet function and yeah let's see

- [03:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=10913) and yeah let's see let's see if this is working i have

- [03:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=10915) let's see if this is working i have turned this into a data ajax true

- [03:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=10918) turned this into a data ajax true so that should be a full prospect but

- [03:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=10922) so that should be a full prospect but only and ajax query i didn't set

- [03:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=10926) only and ajax query i didn't set any on complete method right now

- [03:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=10930) any on complete method right now by the way this will break our root

- [03:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=10933) by the way this will break our root method

- [03:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=10934) method task list items because it is ajax

- [03:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=10946) and after this is done it won't refresh our list but it should prevent

- [03:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=10951) our list but it should prevent paul okay and memory refresh yes it is

- [03:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=10954) paul okay and memory refresh yes it is working

- [03:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=10955) working okay so we can also add our

- [03:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=10958) okay so we can also add our uh this is super super awesome

- [03:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=10962) uh this is super super awesome uh super easy as well uh we can just

- [03:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=10966) uh super easy as well uh we can just add this to our graph here

- [03:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=10974) on our list so it will be fully uh post it will be fully

- [03:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=10977) uh post it will be fully asynchronous but let's just keep this

- [03:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=10981) asynchronous but let's just keep this so list task items

- [03:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=10992) okay let's name this as this below table is not fully

- [03:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=11012) okay and i will copy and paste it

- [03:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=11020) okay this law table is fully asynchronous with ajax

- [03:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=11023) asynchronous with ajax and so

- [03:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=11026) and so on delete data ajax

- [03:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=11029) on delete data ajax equal to true and stata ajax

- [03:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=11049) what was it let's see okay they just complete load

- [03:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=11052) okay they just complete load list of items so delete is now

- [03:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=11055) list of items so delete is now asynchronous and

- [03:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=11058) asynchronous and then there is also edit item however

- [03:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=11062) then there is also edit item however edit item requires

- [03:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=11064) edit item requires a new page to be opened therefore

- [03:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=11068) a new page to be opened therefore it will remain as it is right now we can

- [03:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=11071) it will remain as it is right now we can also

- [03:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=11072) also pop up a new window to edit that

- [03:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=11076) pop up a new window to edit that the logic is same and

- [03:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=11080) the logic is same and about loading item

- [03:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=11091) yeah i will show you how to add a loading icon to your

- [03:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=11093) loading icon to your page as well and then as a next thing

- [03:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=11098) page as well and then as a next thing i will show you how to code a custom

- [03:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=11102) i will show you how to code a custom authentication system like a login

- [03:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=11112) but i may uh keep it to the next picture as well okay so here when i

- [03:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=11115) picture as well okay so here when i delete this it will

- [03:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=11116) delete this it will get deleted and updated you see now

- [03:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=11118) get deleted and updated you see now working

- [03:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=11119) working yeah fully asynchronous and let's also

- [03:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=11122) yeah fully asynchronous and let's also add a

- [03:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=11123) add a loading icon so loading i

- [03:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=11127) loading icon so loading i can give

- [03:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=11131) can give from somewhere let's see from flood

- [03:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=11133) from somewhere let's see from flood items

- [03:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=11161) okay such as this one and okay it doesn't

- [03:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=11165) and okay it doesn't provide a link

- [03:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=11188) okay i think oh maybe okay one seconds

- [03:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=11214) anyway let's add it to our application instead of looking for a cdn

- [03:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=11217) application instead of looking for a cdn so let's add it to our

- [03:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=11228) www root here images let's add an existing item

- [03:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=11238) okay downloads which is spinach and basically what we are going to do is

- [03:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=11241) and basically what we are going to do is we will set this uh inside

- [03:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=11246) we will set this uh inside our loading div

- [03:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=11249) our loading div here we have

- [03:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=11252) here we have the id loading system

- [03:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=11255) the id loading system i guess image will be equal

- [03:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=11259) i guess image will be equal to images start which is finished

- [03:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=11263) to images start which is finished fully automatic and i also need to set

- [03:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=11266) fully automatic and i also need to set the position

- [03:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=11268) the position in position center of the screen

- [03:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=11286) um positions like this

- [03:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=11293) so this looks better so let's add this as a

- [03:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=11295) as a styling

- [03:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=11302) pop-up class okay so the class will be equal to this

- [03:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=11305) so the class will be equal to this you see it is visible hidden and

- [03:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=11315) okay data is actually learning how to use this as hidden

- [03:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=11329) example no

- [03:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=11344) okay so yes we got that and we see i need to look for using some i have

- [03:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=11345) need to look for using some i have something in my mind but

- [03:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=11347) something in my mind but maybe there is an easier way so why not

- [03:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=11351) maybe there is an easier way so why not look for easier way

- [03:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=11356) look for easier way so deep loading

- [03:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=11377) okay here so div height will be set as default and will be changed dynamically

- [03:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=11385) how oh it says that write a css and scripts

- [03:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=11388) oh it says that write a css and scripts hide and show loading image

- [03:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=11390) hide and show loading image okay i was going to do that but

- [03:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=11398) um is not um the way i was hoping for i was

- [03:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=11402) is not um the way i was hoping for i was hoping automatically

- [03:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=11404) hoping automatically showing it and hiding it so

- [03:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=11408) showing it and hiding it so data ajax loading actually i can

- [03:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=11412) data ajax loading actually i can do this as with two methods

- [03:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=11415) do this as with two methods and show loading

- [03:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=11419) and show loading and then hide loading

- [03:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=11423) and then hide loading so inside show loading

- [03:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=11427) so inside show loading function so

- [03:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=11431) function so loading what we are going to do is

- [03:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=11434) loading what we are going to do is we will use jquery to get

- [03:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=11438) we will use jquery to get loading class

- [03:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=11441) loading class loading a div and we will

- [03:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3aplS2EDw&t=11444) loading a div and we will say show basically
