### Video Transcription


- [00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWEVLT9j_vY&t=1) Good morning everyone, welcome to Google IO.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWEVLT9j_vY&t=8) It's great to see so many of you here at&nbsp; Showline, so many developers and a huge&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWEVLT9j_vY&t=14) thanks to the millions joining from around&nbsp; the world. From Bangladesh to Brazil to our&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWEVLT9j_vY&t=20) new Bayview campus right next door. So great&nbsp; to have you as always. As you may have heard,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWEVLT9j_vY&t=27) AI is having a very busy year. So we've&nbsp; got lots to talk about, let's get started.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWEVLT9j_vY&t=34) Seven years into our journey as an AI first&nbsp; company, we are at an exciting inflection point.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWEVLT9j_vY&t=41) We have an opportunity to make AI even&nbsp; more helpful for people, for businesses,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWEVLT9j_vY&t=48) for communities, for everyone. We have&nbsp; been applying AI to make our products&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWEVLT9j_vY&t=54) radically more helpful for a while. With&nbsp; generative AI, we are taking the next step.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWEVLT9j_vY&t=60) With a bold and responsible approach, we are&nbsp; reimagining all our core products, including&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWEVLT9j_vY&t=67) search. You will hear more later in the keynote.&nbsp; Let me start with a few examples of how generative&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWEVLT9j_vY&t=75) AI is helping to evolve our products, starting&nbsp; with Gmail. In 2017, we launched Smart Reply,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWEVLT9j_vY&t=85) short responses you could select with just one&nbsp; click. Next came Smart Compose, which offered&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWEVLT9j_vY&t=93) writing suggestions as you type. Smart Compose led&nbsp; to more advanced writing features powered by AI.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWEVLT9j_vY&t=100) They've been used in workspace over 180 billion&nbsp; times in the past year alone. And now with a much&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWEVLT9j_vY&t=108) more powerful generative model, we are taking&nbsp; the next step in Gmail with Help Me Write.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWEVLT9j_vY&t=114) Let's say you got this email that your flight&nbsp; was canceled. The airline has sent a voucher,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWEVLT9j_vY&t=120) but what you really want is a full refund. You&nbsp; could reply and use Help Me Write. Just type in&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWEVLT9j_vY&t=127) the prompt of what you want, an email to ask for a&nbsp; full refund, hit Create, and a full draft appears.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWEVLT9j_vY&t=136) As you can see, it conveniently pulled in&nbsp; flight details from the previous email.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWEVLT9j_vY&t=142) And it looks pretty close to what you want&nbsp; to send. Maybe you want to refine it further.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWEVLT9j_vY&t=147) In this case, a more elaborate email might&nbsp; increase the chances of getting the refund.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWEVLT9j_vY&t=160) And there you go. I think it's ready to send.&nbsp; Help Me Write will start rolling out as part of&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWEVLT9j_vY&t=168) our workspace updates. And just like with Smart&nbsp; Compose, you will see it get better over time.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWEVLT9j_vY&t=175) The next example is Maps. Since the early days&nbsp; of Street View, AI has stitched together billions&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWEVLT9j_vY&t=182) of panoramic images so people can explore the&nbsp; world from their device. At last year's I.O.,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWEVLT9j_vY&t=189) we introduced Immersive View, which uses AI to&nbsp; create a high fidelity representation of a place&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWEVLT9j_vY&t=195) so you can experience it before you visit. Now we&nbsp; are expanding that same technology to do what Maps&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWEVLT9j_vY&t=203) does best, help you get where you want to go.&nbsp; Google Maps provides 20 billion kilometers of&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWEVLT9j_vY&t=211) directions every day. That's a lot of trips.&nbsp; Imagine if you could see your whole trip in&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWEVLT9j_vY&t=217) advance. With Immersive View for Routes, now you&nbsp; can, whether you're walking, cycling or driving.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWEVLT9j_vY&t=225) Let me show you what I mean. Say I'm in New&nbsp; York City and I want to go on a bike ride.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWEVLT9j_vY&t=231) Maps has given me a couple of options close to&nbsp; where I am. I like the one on the waterfront,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWEVLT9j_vY&t=237) so let's go with that. Look scenic. And I want&nbsp; to get a feel for it first. Click on Immersive&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWEVLT9j_vY&t=244) View for Routes and it's an entirely new way&nbsp; to look at my journey. I can zoom in to get an&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWEVLT9j_vY&t=250) incredible bird's eye view of the ride and&nbsp; as we turn, we get onto a great bike path.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWEVLT9j_vY&t=265) It looks like it's going to be a beautiful ride.&nbsp; You can also check today's air quality. Looks like&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWEVLT9j_vY&t=271) AQI is 43, pretty good, and if I want to check&nbsp; traffic and weather and see how they might change&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWEVLT9j_vY&t=278) over the next few hours, I can do that. Looks&nbsp; like it's going to pour later, so maybe I want&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWEVLT9j_vY&t=284) to get going now. Immersive View for Routes will&nbsp; begin to roll out over the summer and launch in&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWEVLT9j_vY&t=291) 15 cities by the end of the year, including&nbsp; London, New York, Tokyo, and San Francisco.
