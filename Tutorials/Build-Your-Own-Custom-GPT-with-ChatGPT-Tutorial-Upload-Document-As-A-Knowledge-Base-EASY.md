### Video Transcription


- [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lbdu3Iq0_00&t=0) We know that many people who want to build the GPT&nbsp; don't know how to code. We've made it so that you&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lbdu3Iq0_00&t=6) can program the GPT just by having a conversation.&nbsp; We believe that natural language is going to be a&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lbdu3Iq0_00&t=12) big part of how people use computers in the future&nbsp; and we think this is an interesting early example.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lbdu3Iq0_00&t=17) So I'd like to show you how to build one. All&nbsp; right, so I'm going to create a GPT that helps&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lbdu3Iq0_00&t=27) give founders and developers advice when starting&nbsp; new projects. I'm going to go to create a GPT&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lbdu3Iq0_00&t=34) here and this drops me into the GPT builder. I&nbsp; worked with founders for years at YC and still,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lbdu3Iq0_00&t=41) whenever I meet developers, the questions I get&nbsp; are always about how do I, you know, think about&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lbdu3Iq0_00&t=44) a business idea, can you give me some advice?&nbsp; I'm going to see if I can build a GPT to help&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lbdu3Iq0_00&t=49) with that. So to start, GPT builder asks me what&nbsp; I want to make and I'm going to say I want to help&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lbdu3Iq0_00&t=56) startup founders think through their&nbsp; business ideas and get advice. After the founder&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lbdu3Iq0_00&t=67) has gotten some advice, grill them on why they are&nbsp; not growing faster. All right. So to start off,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lbdu3Iq0_00&t=80) I just tell the GPT a little bit about what I want&nbsp; here. And it's going to go off and start thinking&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lbdu3Iq0_00&t=85) about that and it's going to write some detailed&nbsp; instructions for the GPT. It's also going to,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lbdu3Iq0_00&t=91) let's see, ask me about a name. How do I feel&nbsp; about startup mentor? That's fine. That's&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lbdu3Iq0_00&t=96) good. So if I didn't like the name, of course, I&nbsp; could call it something else. But it's, you know,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lbdu3Iq0_00&t=100) going to try to have this conversation with me and&nbsp; start there. And you can see here on the right in&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lbdu3Iq0_00&t=107) the preview mode that it's already starting to&nbsp; fill out the GPT where it says what it does,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lbdu3Iq0_00&t=113) it has some, like, ideas of additional questions&nbsp; that I could ask. You know, so it just generated a&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lbdu3Iq0_00&t=121) candidate. Of course, I could regenerate that&nbsp; or change it. But I sort of like that. So,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lbdu3Iq0_00&t=126) I will say that's great. And you see now that&nbsp; the GPT is being built out a little bit more as&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lbdu3Iq0_00&t=134) we go. Now, what I want this to do, how it can&nbsp; interact with users, I could talk about style&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lbdu3Iq0_00&t=140) here. But what I'm going to say is I am going&nbsp; to upload transcripts of some lectures about&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lbdu3Iq0_00&t=149) startups I have given. Please give advice based&nbsp; off of those. All right. So, now, it's going to&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lbdu3Iq0_00&t=161) go figure out how to do that. And I would like&nbsp; to show you the configure tab. So, you can see&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lbdu3Iq0_00&t=164) some of the things that were built out here as we&nbsp; were going by the builder itself. And you can see&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lbdu3Iq0_00&t=169) that there's capabilities here that I can enable.&nbsp; I could add custom actions. These are all fine to&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lbdu3Iq0_00&t=175) leave. I'm going to upload a file. So, here is a&nbsp; lecture that I picked that I used to that I gave&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lbdu3Iq0_00&t=182) with some startup advice. And I'm going to add&nbsp; that here. In terms of these questions, this is&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lbdu3Iq0_00&t=187) a dumb one. The rest of those are reasonable. And&nbsp; very much things founders often ask. I'm going to&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lbdu3Iq0_00&t=195) add one more thing to the instructions here, which&nbsp; is be concise, and constructive with feedback. All&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lbdu3Iq0_00&t=204) right. So, again, if we had more time, I would&nbsp; show you a bunch of other things. But this is&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lbdu3Iq0_00&t=209) this is like a decent start and now we can try it&nbsp; out over on this preview tab so I will say what's&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lbdu3Iq0_00&t=216) a common question. What are three things to look,&nbsp; what are three things to look for when hiring&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lbdu3Iq0_00&t=224) employees at an early stage startup. Now it's gonna&nbsp; look at that document I uploaded. It'll also have&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lbdu3Iq0_00&t=235) of course all of the background knowledge of GPT-4.&nbsp; That's pretty good those are 3 things that I&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lbdu3Iq0_00&t=243) definitely have said many times. Now we could&nbsp; go on and it would start following the other&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lbdu3Iq0_00&t=248) instructions and you know grill me on why I'm&nbsp; not growing faster but in the interest of time&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lbdu3Iq0_00&t=252) I'm gonna skip that. I'm gonna publish this only to&nbsp; me for now. I can work on it later, I can add more&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lbdu3Iq0_00&t=259) content, I can add a few actions that I think would&nbsp; be useful and then I can share it publicly. So&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lbdu3Iq0_00&t=264) that's what it looks like to create a GPT. With. By&nbsp; the way I always I always wanted to do that after&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lbdu3Iq0_00&t=277) like all of the YC office hours I always thought&nbsp; man someday I will be able to make a bot that will&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lbdu3Iq0_00&t=281) do this and that'll be awesome. So with GPT's we're&nbsp; letting people easily share and discover all the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lbdu3Iq0_00&t=289) fun ways that they use ChatGPT with the world.&nbsp; You can make private GPTs like I just did or you&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lbdu3Iq0_00&t=297) can share your creations publicly with a link for&nbsp; anyone to use or if you're on Chat GPT enterprise&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lbdu3Iq0_00&t=304) you can make GPTs just for your company and&nbsp; later this month we're gonna launched the GPT&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lbdu3Iq0_00&t=311) store. You can list a GPT. Thank you I appreciate&nbsp; that. You can list a GPT there and we'll be able&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lbdu3Iq0_00&t=325) to feature the best and the most popular GPTs.&nbsp; Of course, we'll make sure that GPTs in the store&nbsp;

- [00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lbdu3Iq0_00&t=331) follow our policies before they're accessible.&nbsp; Revenue sharing is important to us. We're going&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lbdu3Iq0_00&t=338) to pay people who build the most useful and&nbsp; the most used GPTs a portion of our revenue.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lbdu3Iq0_00&t=344) We're excited to foster a vibrant ecosystem with&nbsp; the GPT store just from what we've been building&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lbdu3Iq0_00&t=349) ourselves over the weekend. We're confident&nbsp; there's going to be a lot of great stuff. We're&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lbdu3Iq0_00&t=352) excited to share more information soon. So those&nbsp; are GPTs, and we can't wait to see what you build.
