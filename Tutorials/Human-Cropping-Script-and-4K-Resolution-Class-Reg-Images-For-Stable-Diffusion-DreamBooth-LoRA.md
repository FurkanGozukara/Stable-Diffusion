I have discovered a workflow that has never been explored before, which allows for studio-quality realism beyond expectations using Stable Diffusion DreamBooth / LoRA training. To achieve this workflow, it required an exceptionally high-quality dataset of classification / regularization images. Additionally, I developed a script capable of automatically processing thousands of real-class images at a resolution of 4K or higher. In this video, I will be sharing both the image dataset and the script with you.

### Video Transcription


- [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTYX0tgA5ho&t=0) Greetings everyone.

- [00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTYX0tgA5ho&t=1) I have prepared a super&nbsp; high quality classification&nbsp;

- [00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTYX0tgA5ho&t=5) regularization

- [00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTYX0tgA5ho&t=7) images dataset for man class.

- [00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTYX0tgA5ho&t=9) This dataset can also be used for fine tuning of Stable Diffusion

- [00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTYX0tgA5ho&t=14) models.

- [00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTYX0tgA5ho&t=15) You can use these images when doing DreamBooth or LoRA training.

- [00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTYX0tgA5ho&t=19) Moreover, I have prepared an amazing auto cropping script.

- [00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTYX0tgA5ho&t=24) This script will crop your subjects into the desired

- [00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTYX0tgA5ho&t=29) target aspect ratios fully automatically.

- [00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTYX0tgA5ho&t=31) So majority of the raw images that I have prepared

- [00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTYX0tgA5ho&t=36) and shared have over 4k resolution.

- [00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTYX0tgA5ho&t=39) For example, this image is 20 megabytes and over 11,000 pixels

- [00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTYX0tgA5ho&t=46) height and 9,000 pixels width.

- [00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTYX0tgA5ho&t=49) So this is the image.

- [00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTYX0tgA5ho&t=50) Let me show you the default resolution.

- [00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTYX0tgA5ho&t=53) You see, these are the details of the original image.

- [00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTYX0tgA5ho&t=58) As you are seeing, it is super high quality.

- [00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTYX0tgA5ho&t=61) Majority of the images are like this and I have over 2700 images that I share with you.

- [00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTYX0tgA5ho&t=68) These images are collected by me manually from unsplash.com.

- [00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTYX0tgA5ho&t=73) Therefore, they are 100% okay to use for even commercial purposes.

- [00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTYX0tgA5ho&t=80) So by using the script that I have developed, I have cropped these images into these aspect

- [00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTYX0tgA5ho&t=88) ratios. Why did I prepare this dataset?

- [00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTYX0tgA5ho&t=91) Because with my upcoming workflow to do DreamBooth

- [00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTYX0tgA5ho&t=94) training beyond studio quality, I needed real images with

- [00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTYX0tgA5ho&t=98) higher resolution, higher dimension.

- [00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTYX0tgA5ho&t=100) After cropping these images into these dimensions, then I used Automatic1111 web UI train tab

- [00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTYX0tgA5ho&t=108) preprocess images to downscale them into the target dimension.

- [00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTYX0tgA5ho&t=113) And when doing this, I have used auto focal point crop.

- [00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTYX0tgA5ho&t=117) Why?

- [00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTYX0tgA5ho&t=118) Now I will explain you the process.

- [00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTYX0tgA5ho&t=120) So let's say I have this image that I will turn into the different aspect ratios.

- [00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTYX0tgA5ho&t=127) This image resolution is 2916x4886.

- [00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTYX0tgA5ho&t=134) Therefore, this image won't fit into all of the aspect ratios.

- [00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTYX0tgA5ho&t=140) For example, my script has found that this image can only be extracted as 2915x4551

- [00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTYX0tgA5ho&t=150) for 512x512 aspect ratio because my script is extracting the subject, the person.

- [00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTYX0tgA5ho&t=158) Therefore, it cannot crop it automatically.

- [00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTYX0tgA5ho&t=161) So with using Automatic1111 web UI cropping script,

- [00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTYX0tgA5ho&t=166) this is the final result we got for 512 and 512.

- [00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTYX0tgA5ho&t=170) You see the face part is automatically cropped that will fit into 512 and 512.

- [00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTYX0tgA5ho&t=177) Okay, this is another example image.

- [00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTYX0tgA5ho&t=180) This is raw image 4,000 by 6,000.

- [00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTYX0tgA5ho&t=183) As you see, this can be cropped perfectly fine into pretty much any dimension.

- [00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTYX0tgA5ho&t=189) So you see this is the 512 by 512 aspect ratio that my script has automatically extracted.

- [00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTYX0tgA5ho&t=196) Then by using the Automatic1111 web UI, we downscaled it to 512 by 512.

- [00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTYX0tgA5ho&t=203) Let's also look at another aspect ratio.

- [00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTYX0tgA5ho&t=206) So this is the image in 768 by 1024 pixels.

- [00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTYX0tgA5ho&t=212) All of these are automatically done with my script and post-processing of Automatic1111

- [00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTYX0tgA5ho&t=217) web UI.

- [00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTYX0tgA5ho&t=218) From this raw image into this absolutely perfectly cropped image in this aspect ratio.

- [00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTYX0tgA5ho&t=226) So now let me show you how my script works.

- [00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTYX0tgA5ho&t=228) So this is the entire script.

- [00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTYX0tgA5ho&t=230) It is pretty easy to use.

- [00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTYX0tgA5ho&t=232) You can write here any aspect ratio that you want.

- [00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTYX0tgA5ho&t=235) It will automatically process all of the images in the given folder

- [00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTYX0tgA5ho&t=239) and turn them into these aspect ratios.

- [00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTYX0tgA5ho&t=243) So this is the script.

- [00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTYX0tgA5ho&t=244) Let me show you a script with zooming in if you want to type it.

- [00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTYX0tgA5ho&t=248) Alternatively, I have posted this on my Patreon.

- [00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTYX0tgA5ho&t=252) This is another part of the script.

- [00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTYX0tgA5ho&t=253) Just pause the video and type it if you are not my Patreon supporter.

- [00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTYX0tgA5ho&t=258) This is another part of the script.

- [00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTYX0tgA5ho&t=260) I have spent quite a bit of time to write this script.

- [00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTYX0tgA5ho&t=264) This is written from scratch by me.

- [00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTYX0tgA5ho&t=267) So here is another part of the script and here is the end of the script.

- [00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTYX0tgA5ho&t=270) For using this script, you just need to change the folder paths here.

- [00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTYX0tgA5ho&t=276) The first folder is your raw images and the second folder is the target folder

- [00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTYX0tgA5ho&t=282) where the images will be extracted.

- [00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTYX0tgA5ho&t=284) Let me quickly show you the installation.

- [00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTYX0tgA5ho&t=286) So after downloading the script files from this Patreon post,

- [00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTYX0tgA5ho&t=290) put them into any folder you want or you can write it yourself.

- [00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTYX0tgA5ho&t=294) In the requirements.txt file, these are the requirements.

- [00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTYX0tgA5ho&t=298) Start a new cmd window.

- [00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTYX0tgA5ho&t=300) Type python-m venv venv.

- [00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTYX0tgA5ho&t=304) Then move into your venv folder like this.

- [00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTYX0tgA5ho&t=308) Move into scripts.

- [00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTYX0tgA5ho&t=309) Activate.

- [00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTYX0tgA5ho&t=310) Then move into the root folder where you have downloaded the files.

- [00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTYX0tgA5ho&t=314) Type pip install -r requirements.txt.

- [00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTYX0tgA5ho&t=318) It will install all of the dependencies, necessary libraries.

- [00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTYX0tgA5ho&t=322) So here installation completed folder.

- [00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTYX0tgA5ho&t=325) Put the original images into original images folder.

- [00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTYX0tgA5ho&t=329) Don't forget to change the path of your original images folder like this.

- [00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTYX0tgA5ho&t=334) Open your virtual environment scripts.

- [00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTYX0tgA5ho&t=337) Activate.

- [00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTYX0tgA5ho&t=338) Move into the root folder.

- [00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTYX0tgA5ho&t=340) Type python.

- [00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTYX0tgA5ho&t=341) Then the script name, which is cropper.py.

- [00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTYX0tgA5ho&t=345) Hit enter.

- [00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTYX0tgA5ho&t=345) And it will start processing all of the images.

- [00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTYX0tgA5ho&t=349) Don't forget that you have activated the virtual environment.

- [00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTYX0tgA5ho&t=352) Now we will begin to see results in these new images folder.

- [00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTYX0tgA5ho&t=356) This script is extremely useful to auto crop massive amount of images.

- [00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTYX0tgA5ho&t=362) Okay, it's starting processing.

- [00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTYX0tgA5ho&t=364) You see it is also pretty fast.

- [00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTYX0tgA5ho&t=366) Let's look at the folders.

- [00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTYX0tgA5ho&t=368) You see it is extracting my own images with the desired aspect ratio.

- [00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTYX0tgA5ho&t=374) This is 512, 512.

- [00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTYX0tgA5ho&t=376) This is 512, 768.

- [00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTYX0tgA5ho&t=379) This is 640, 960.

- [00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTYX0tgA5ho&t=383) This is 768, 512.

- [00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTYX0tgA5ho&t=386) This is 768, 1024.

- [00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTYX0tgA5ho&t=391) This is 960 by 640.

- [00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTYX0tgA5ho&t=415) Then use Automatic1111 web UI

- [00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTYX0tgA5ho&t=418) train tab, preprocess and downscale them into any width and height you want with

- [00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTYX0tgA5ho&t=474) Why this matters?

- [00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTYX0tgA5ho&t=475) Because I have found a new amazing workflow that will produce even better than studio

- [00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTYX0tgA5ho&t=482) quality photo shoots on your computer with DreamBooth training.

- [00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTYX0tgA5ho&t=486) For this task, I have used 768 by 1024.

- [00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTYX0tgA5ho&t=491) Therefore, I have collected and prepared this amazing images data set for you.

- [00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTYX0tgA5ho&t=496) One more thing, I also suggest you to use this realistic vision version 2

- [00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTYX0tgA5ho&t=508) Why?

- [00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTYX0tgA5ho&t=509) Because this file is 3.85 gigabytes.

- [00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTYX0tgA5ho&t=512) It has more weights.

- [00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTYX0tgA5ho&t=513) It is better for training.
