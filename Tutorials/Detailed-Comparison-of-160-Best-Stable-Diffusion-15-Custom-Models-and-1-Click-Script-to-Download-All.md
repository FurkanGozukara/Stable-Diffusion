### Video Transcription


- [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=0) Greetings, everyone.

- [00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=1) In this video, I am going to share with you a one-click downloader to download very best

- [00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=7) Stable Diffusion 1.5 based custom models into your computer or into RunPod or into any cloud.

- [00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=16) I will show both RunPod and Windows how you can download all of these amazing very best

- [00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=22) Stable Diffusion 1.5 based models.

- [00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=27) Moreover, I have generated their X/Y/Z checkpoint comparison with 9 images per prompt.

- [00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=36) You see a photo of a man.

- [00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=37) This image is over 1 gigapixel.

- [00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=40) I am going to make a detailed analysis of each model for 768 to 768 pixels resolution.

- [00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=49) I am also going to make a detailed comparison of the image of a man prompt and I will explain

- [00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=56) the difference between the image of a man and photo of a man prompt for 768 to 768 resolution.

- [00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=64) I am also going to compare 1024 to 1024 pixel resolution and show you which one of the models

- [00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=72) are able to generate accurate images, good anatomy having images for 1024 to 1024 pixel

- [00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=81) resolution.

- [00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=82) I am also sharing all of these X/Y/Z plot comparisons.

- [00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=88) You see a 1.1 gigabyte file, 1.1 gigabyte file, 1.2 gigabyte file, 1.5 gigabyte file,

- [00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=94) 2 gigabyte file.

- [00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=95) You can see their grid resolutions 1.2 gigapixels, 1.5 gigapixels, 2.1 gigapixels.

- [00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=101) During the video, my comments will give you a lot of tips and you will see which models

- [00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=108) are best for stylization or realism or cartoon or 3D.

- [00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=113) This video will be amazing.

- [00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=114) The reason why I have generated such file and I am making this video is that I will

- [00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=121) pick the very best realism model and I will do empirical experimentation on that model

- [00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=128) to find out the very best DreamBooth training hyperparameters with Kohya and you will be

- [00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=135) able to use those parameters in OneTrainer or in other trainers as well, which will help

- [00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=140) you to train your Stable Diffusion 1.5 based models with amazing quality and accuracy and

- [00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=147) generalization.

- [00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=149) I have done the same thing for SDXL base version.

- [00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=153) It is working amazing.

- [00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=154) I have done over 100 trainings for SDXL base version.

- [00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=158) Hopefully, I will also make the same for SD 1.5 based version.

- [00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=163) So this tutorial is recorded for that purpose and this tutorial will show you the very best

- [00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=170) models for every category for Stable Diffusion 1.5 based models.

- [00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=174) So before start comparing the X/Y/Z plot comparisons of all of the 161 models, I will show you

- [00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=183) how you can one-click download all of them into your Automatic1111 Web UI folder on Windows

- [00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=190) and also on RunPod and use them if you wish.

- [00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=193) The link to this Patreon post will be in the description of the video.

- [00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=197) You don't have to be my Patreon supporter to follow this tutorial and see the which

- [00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=203) models are performing best because I will show them on the screen for you.

- [00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=208) Still, I have also uploaded the files, original files into this post, so you can also download

- [00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=213) them onto your computer and compare them later if you wish.

- [00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=217) To download all of the models with one click, just download this .bat file and .py file.

- [00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=223) For Windows, these two are just sufficient.

- [00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=225) Go to downloads, edit the .py file and in here, there is download models.

- [00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=232) You will see at the very bottom, you see download folder here.

- [00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=236) Just change this folder wherever you want to download.

- [00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=240) Let's say I want to download inside my G drive inside temp7 folder wherever you want.

- [00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=247) So just replace this folder path like this and save it and then go back to where you

- [00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=254) have downloaded files.

- [00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=255) Double-click download top 160 SD models .bat file.

- [00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=260) Run anyway, it will run this .py file and it will ask you how many simultaneous downloads

- [00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=267) you want.

- [00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=268) I suggest you use one simultaneous download because if you use more threads to download,

- [00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=273) you will likely to encounter errors and you will be needed to rerun the script.

- [00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=279) Let's say three, for example, it will start three simultaneous downloads.

- [00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=284) So what is good about this script is that let's say there were some errors during the

- [00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=288) download.

- [00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=289) After the script run has been completed, rerun the script and it will only download the not

- [00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=297) accurately downloaded files.

- [00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=298) So it has a continue feature.

- [00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=299) You see sometimes you may get errors while downloading.

- [00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=302) The script will handle everything automatically for you.

- [00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=305) Just run the script again and it will download all of the files fully accurately.

- [00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=310) We can also see that the download has been started inside our given folder.

- [00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=314) You see Realistic Vision version 1.1, Realistic Vision version 6, Majimix.

- [00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=318) Let me also show you all of the models that have been downloaded previously.

- [00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=323) All of the models are here.

- [00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=325) Let me show like extra-large icon.

- [00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=327) Let me show like as a list.

- [00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=329) Here you see all of the models and you may be wondering how many gigabytes they are.

- [00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=334) When I see the properties, you see 411 gigabytes is the total size of the models.

- [00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=342) So if you don't want to download all of the models, just comment the models like this

- [00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=347) that you don't want to download.

- [00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=349) And the script will not download the models that you don't want them to get downloaded.

- [00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=354) So how can you download them on RunPod?

- [00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=356) First, let's log in to our RunPod account.

- [00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=359) So from this link, you can go to their sign-up or login.

- [00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=362) So this is my account.

- [00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=364) Let's go to pods.

- [00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=365) Let's click new pod.

- [00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=366) The interface slightly changed, you see.

- [00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=369) So in here, first select your template.

- [00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=372) You see choose template.

- [00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=373) I will use Stable Diffusion template.

- [00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=376) Wow, where is the search?

- [00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=378) They changed the search.

- [00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=380) So I will search with the browser.

- [00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=382) Okay, RunPod Stable Diffusion Web UI template, this one.

- [00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=386) Then you can use either secure or community cloud.

- [00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=389) I will use community cloud extreme speed.

- [00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=392) And let's go with RTX 3090 deploy customized deployments set the disk volume persistent

- [00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=399) disk volume according to how many models you want to do or not.

- [00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=402) Let's set overrides continue deploy.

- [00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=405) Let's go to my pods.

- [00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=406) Let's wait until it is loaded.

- [00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=409) I have amazing RunPod tutorials on our channel.

- [00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=412) Just click this search icon.

- [00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=414) You see the search icon.

- [00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=416) And just type Runpod.

- [00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=417) Or whatever the search term you are looking for, you will get all the videos that I have

- [00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=423) for RunPod with this link.

- [00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=425) So if you don't know how to use RunPod, you can watch these amazing tutorials.

- [00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=428) Okay, let's connect to the Jupyter lab from here, upload the .py file, nothing else, which

- [00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=435) is here, change the path if you need.

- [00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=438) Since we have changed the default path, I will re-set it, which is at the very top here.

- [00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=443) So the accurate path will be inside models, Stable Diffusion folder, let's copy the path,

- [00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=449) paste it like this.

- [00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=450) Okay workspace like this.

- [00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=452) Yes, it is accurate.

- [00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=453) Then just open a new terminal.

- [00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=456) You see currently I am not in the workspace.

- [00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=458) So let's move into the workspace like this and just type Python and download top 160

- [00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=466) SD models.

- [00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=467) Let's download with five threads and it will start downloading everything into the accurate

- [00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=474) Automatic1111 web UI folder.

- [00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=476) Again, if you get errors, run the script one more time until you get all the models fully

- [00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=482) downloaded.

- [00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=483) That's it.

- [00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=484) So it is downloading with 100 megabytes per second speed.

- [00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=487) I have spent quite a bit of time to prepare this downloader over one day.

- [00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=492) Now we can begin testing the results and finding out which model is best.

- [00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=498) I will delete this pod.

- [00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=499) Until you delete your pod with terminate, it will remain as it is.

- [00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=503) So I will just terminate.

- [00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=505) Okay, so all the images are here.

- [00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=507) How can you download them?

- [00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=509) Right-click, click Save link as and select the download folder.

- [00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=513) Let's download into downloads.

- [00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=515) You can download every one of them.

- [00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=517) And you see the resolutions are here.

- [00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=519) So if your computer is not strong enough, you can download the half-resolution of the

- [00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=524) grids or the 25% resolution of the grids.

- [00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=528) But since my computer is strong, I will download the full-resolution files.

- [00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=533) So let's just download them.

- [00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=534) The file size and resolutions are all written here.

- [00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=538) This is the way you download.

- [00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=540) Okay, I have all the files downloaded here, obviously.

- [00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=544) So how am I going to open them?

- [00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=546) I will use the Windows default photo viewer.

- [00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=550) So let's begin with a photo of a man.

- [00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=552) I did test three prompts for 768 to 768: photo of a man, image of a man, and picture of a

- [00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=559) man because photo of a man will add realism to the generated images.

- [00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=564) Therefore, I tested image of a man and picture of a man too.

- [00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=568) So you can see which models are more realistic and which models are performing for more like

- [00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=573) anime or cartoon or 3D.

- [00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=576) Okay, let's begin with a photo of a man.

- [00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=578) Currently, my aim is finding the very best model for realism.

- [00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=583) Just wait until the image fully loads because the images are huge.

- [00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=587) Therefore, it will take time to load.

- [00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=589) You see still not fully loaded.

- [00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=591) Okay, now fully loaded.

- [00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=593) Let's go to the very beginning.

- [00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=595) This is 768 to 768.

- [00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=598) This resolution is currently almost as a standard for SD 1.5 based models.

- [00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=603) But I also have tested 768 to 1024 and 1024 to 1024.

- [00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=609) So we will be able to see best performing models at high resolution.

- [00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=615) Okay, the names of the models are written at the top so you can see the first model.

- [00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=621) This is the second model not very good.

- [00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=624) It generates a lot of black and white here as well.

- [00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=627) Absolute reality.

- [00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=628) All right.

- [00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=630) Abyss orange model, aing diffusion model like this you see Airtist MAL Realistic version

- [00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=636) 2.5 model.

- [00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=637) In some of the models, you will see almost the same man because the majority of the models

- [00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=643) are just merges, not new trainings.

- [00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=646) Therefore, they will print the same man.

- [00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=648) Okay, this is Airtist MAL model like this.

- [00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=653) This is AmIReal model.

- [00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=655) You see there are some major problems with this model.

- [00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=657) This is Amour Bold model.

- [00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=659) This is a pretty good model.

- [00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=661) You can see the quality here.

- [00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=662) It's a pretty decent model.

- [00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=664) And this is just photo of man, nothing else in the prompt.

- [00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=668) No negatives, nothing else, CFG 7.

- [00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=670) And I have used DPM++ 2M SDE Karras sampler.

- [00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=672) This is the best sampler that I find and use it for the steps.

- [00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=678) Okay, this is Analog Madness model.

- [00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=680) You see pretty decent quality.

- [00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=683) But about diversity, are we getting diverse faces?

- [00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=688) No, the faces are very similar, but pretty good quality.

- [00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=692) And this is AniMerge model as you are seeing right now.

- [00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=695) Here's the model.

- [00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=696) It is not very realistic.

- [00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=698) This is AniMics model.

- [00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=699) You see it's a pretty decent quality, but at distance shots, of course, the faces are

- [00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=705) not that great.

- [00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=706) This is AniToon model.

- [00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=708) Oh, the face is really good at a distant shot too, as you're seeing right now.

- [00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=712) So this is AnReal version 3 model.

- [00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=715) Again, I see all blue eyes.

- [00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=718) These models are overfit.

- [00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=719) This is an AnRealSpiceMix as you're seeing right now.

- [00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=723) This is AnyLoRA model.

- [00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=726) Not that great quality.

- [00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=727) This is Any LoRA Anime Mix model.

- [00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=730) Not that great quality either, but it has an anime look.

- [00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=733) That's for sure.

- [00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=734) This is Art Universe version 8 model.

- [00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=737) This is how it is.

- [00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=739) This is Arthemy Comics version 6 model.

- [00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=742) Okay, this has a problematic output.

- [00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=745) Not that a great model.

- [00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=747) This is Arthemy Real version 1.

- [00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=749) Again, I almost see the same face as the other models.

- [00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=754) This is AWPortrait model.

- [00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=755) Not that a great quality.

- [00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=758) Probably Asian model.

- [00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=759) This is Beauty By Stable Yogi version 3 model.

- [00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=763) Not that a great quality.

- [00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=764) This is Beauty Fool Ultra Real version 1 model.

- [00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=769) Okay.

- [00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=770) Not that a great quality either.

- [00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=772) This is BeenYou model.

- [00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=774) It looks like Asian anime mixing model.

- [00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=778) Not that great quality.

- [00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=779) Beyond Reality version 2 model.

- [00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=781) Not that great quality, but the faces are pretty different and that's a good thing.

- [00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=786) If you are getting pretty different faces, that is a good thing.

- [00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=789) That means that the model is not very over-trained.

- [00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=792) So this model, Beyond Reality version 2, has some decent training.

- [00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=796) That's for sure.

- [00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=797) This model is one of the good ones.

- [00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=799) This is Blazing Drive model.

- [00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=801) This is the style that it has.

- [00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=803) This is a blue pencil.

- [00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=804) I don't know why I am getting like this output.

- [00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=807) This is Cheese Daddy model.

- [00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=809) Not a good one.

- [00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=810) One of the old models and you see it is bad outputting.

- [00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=814) This is Chik Mix model.

- [00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=816) Almost same man.

- [00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=817) Not a good model.

- [00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=818) Colorful version 8 model.

- [00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=820) Not the quality is not very good.

- [00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=822) This is Consistent Factor Euclid model and I see the almost same face again.

- [00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=828) This is Corbe Realism model.

- [00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=830) I don't know this model outputs a very skinny man like this and the almost same man every

- [00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=836) time you see.

- [00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=837) So pretty overfit model.

- [00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=838) This is Cornucopia version 2.2.

- [00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=842) This model has a very very good clothing and environment quality.

- [00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=846) It is like a cinematic shots.

- [00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=849) The faces are very similar but this is also another looking good model.

- [00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=853) The quality of the environment and the pictures and the clothing are really good.

- [00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=858) This is Counterfeit version 3.

- [00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=860) An old model.

- [00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=861) Not that good.

- [00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=862) This is Cyber Realistic 2.5D. Not that good.

- [00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=866) This Cyber Realistic Classic model.

- [00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=868) Yeah, almost those repeating same man images.

- [00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=871) Cyber Realistic version 4.

- [00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=874) Again the quality is like this.

- [00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=876) Not that very realistic.

- [00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=877) Cyber Realistic version 4.1.

- [00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=880) Almost same, you see there aren't almost any difference between version 4 and version 4.1.

- [00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=885) All right, let's continue.

- [00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=887) Daring Hydra model.

- [00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=889) The images are like this.

- [00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=890) This has a somewhat chubby and that is good because it's a diversity in the output and

- [00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=898) therefore this is also a decent model.

- [00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=900) It prints not exactly the same face or body.

- [00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=904) Okay, this is Dark Sushi 2.5 model.

- [00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=907) This is Dark Sun version 7B model.

- [00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=910) As you are seeing right now, this is Dark Sushi Mix version 2.25.

- [00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=916) By the way, if you are also a model developer, you can message me and hopefully I will add

- [00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=921) them to my downloader.

- [00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=922) My downloader downloads will be counted on your model downloads.

- [00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=926) Don't worry about that.

- [00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=928) And this is Deliberate version 3.

- [00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=930) An old model but I still included it.

- [00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=932) This is the output.

- [00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=933) This is Deliberate version 5.

- [00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=935) You see not that great quality if you ask me.

- [00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=938) This is Disney Pixar Cartoon Type A model and this is the output.

- [00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=942) It gives not a great quality obviously.

- [00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=945) This is Divine Anime Mix Version 2 model.

- [00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=948) Not that great.

- [00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=949) Divine A Legend Mix.

- [00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=950) By the way, I noticed that usually the new anime models have higher base resolution.

- [00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=957) This is Dream Shaper Version 8.

- [00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=959) The realism is not good, but it has a stylized output and it is decent.

- [00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=964) This is Dreamy Cybergasm model.

- [00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=967) You see, I see the same face as in the others, so another merged model I can say.

- [00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=973) This is DucHaiten Retro.

- [00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=975) This looks like a little bit like Asian model, and also I noticed a noise here, so this is

- [00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=981) probably one of the older models that also got affected from some training bugs.

- [00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=988) Epic PhotoGasm Last Unicorn model.

- [00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=989) Okay, this model is one of the really good models, you will see that the images are really

- [00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=995) high quality, realistic, not exactly the same face, some difference, they have some different

- [00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=1001) persons and looks, so this is one of the really good models, Last Unicorn.

- [00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=1006) There is also a Epic PhotoGasm Z Universal model, let's compare both of them like this,

- [00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=1013) pretty similar models, not exactly the same, so you can use the Epic PhotoGasm latest model,

- [00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=1020) it is a pretty decent high quality model, the resolution of this model is also good

- [00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=1024) I will show you.

- [00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=1025) This is Epic Realism Natural Release Candidate 1 model, the face is almost the same person,

- [00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=1031) but the realism is really good, you see the skin tones, the skin textures, the details,

- [00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=1037) this is another really good model.

- [00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=1039) The only problem is that it prints almost the same face, so it is pretty overfit, but

- [00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=1044) it is a really realistic model.

- [00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=1047) The details and the realism is really, really high.

- [00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=1051) This is Ether Real Mix model, you see, like this as you are seeing right now.

- [00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=1055) This is Experience Version 10 model, it has a certain style, not that realistic.

- [00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=1060) This is FaeTastic Version 2 model, this is an old model probably not a good quality.

- [00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=1069) This is Fantastic Mix K1 model, this also has the noise that older models have.

- [00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=1072) This is Fenn Foto FF2 model, not a good one, you see.

- [00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=1076) This is Flat 2D Animerge, this model is really good if you want to turn your images into

- [00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=1082) 2D anime type.

- [00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=1084) It is pretty strong overfit model for 2D, but it works good, and the quality is also

- [00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=1089) decent, you see.

- [00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=1090) Okay, this is Ghost Mix model, not that good one.

- [00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=1094) This is Gui Realism Photo Version 1, I almost see the same face as others, probably another

- [00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=1100) mixed model.

- [00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=1101) This is Guo Feng 3 Version 3 model, this looks like an Asian model but not that great quality.

- [00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=1107) This is Hello Art Oil model, you see, it has an oil style output, it's decent.

- [00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=1113) This is Hello Kid 2.5D Version 1 model, the quality is somewhat decent.

- [00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=1120) This is Henmix Real Version 4 model, this model also doesn't look that good.

- [00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=1125) This is Himawari Mix model, you see, this is its style.

- [00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=1129) This is Hyper Realism Version 3 model, okay, it has different faces in all images, that

- [00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=1136) is really, really good, but the quality is not that, I don't know, quality is also looking

- [00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=1141) decent.

- [00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=1142) So this is one another realism model, it looks pretty decent and pretty accurate too, it

- [00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=1147) also looks like very, very diverse output, you see, every face is a different person

- [00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=1154) and that is a very big plus, Hyper Realism Version 3.

- [00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=1158) Okay, again another model, you see, this model when we compare these two models, the right

- [00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=1162) model Hyper Natural is extremely overfit, the face is very similar, but when you look

- [00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=1167) at Hyper Realism Version 3, the faces are completely different at each image, therefore

- [00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=1173) we can say that Hyper Realism Version 3 is much more generalized model than the Hyper

- [00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=1178) Natural Version 1.

- [00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=1179) Okay, this is another model, ICBINP SECO, you see, almost the same face in every image,

- [00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=1188) it is a decent quality but not much generalization.

- [00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=1192) This is Incredible World Version 4, this looks like a somewhat not realistic output.

- [00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=1198) Yeah.

- [00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=1199) Jernau Mix Chimera, you see, almost the same face in every image or like the other models.

- [00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=1205) Juggernaut Aftermath, okay, Juggernaut is very popular but I don't find it as realistic

- [00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=1210) as the other models that we have seen, it's pretty decent quality but you see the face

- [00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=1216) is very similar, it is not like a different person in each image.

- [00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=1219) This is Juggernaut Final model, again decent quality but almost the same person, same pose.

- [00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=1226) Juggernaut Reborn, you see these models are really overfit compared to the other model

- [00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=1232) that we have seen.

- [00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=1234) This is JXKRE model, not a very good one.

- [00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=1237) This is Kawaii Realistic European model, okay, this model also has noise.

- [00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=1242) This is Korean Style 2.5D model, not a good quality.

- [00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=1247) This is Kotos Mix Version 1 model, not a good quality.

- [00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=1251) This is Lahmix Mysterious Version 2, it's a decent quality model, you see, but not that

- [00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=1259) extremely good, but decent.

- [00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=1261) This is LEOSAM Film Grain model, and this is the output it gives.

- [00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=1266) Yeah, I don't think so that's very good.

- [00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=1268) Okay, this is Limitless Vision Version 3 model, you see the outputs like this, not that a

- [00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=1273) great model.

- [00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=1274) This is Lofi Version 4, not that a great model.

- [00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=1278) This is Lyriel Version 1 model, it has a certain style, and not that a great model.

- [00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=1284) This is Mag Mix Version 9, by the way, when I say not that a great model in terms of realism,

- [00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=1290) I am saying that, so these models can be good for other tasks, other prompts, but I am just

- [00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=1296) comparing for the most realistic model right now for studio shot-like quality that we can

- [00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=1302) do DreamBooth training on.

- [00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=1303) Okay, this is another model, this is a decent model for like an Asian model, you can see

- [00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=1309) Mag Mix Version 9.

- [00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=1311) This is Majimix Alpha Version 2 model, the quality is decent, only problem is I see that

- [00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=1316) this face is very similar in each image, and there's also some anatomical problem, like

- [00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=1322) on this image, yeah, anatomical problem.

- [00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=1324) This is Majimix Fantasy model, you see this is the output.

- [00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=1328) This is Majimix Lux model, these are the output.

- [00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=1332) This is Majimix Realistic model, not that realistic, that's for sure.

- [00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=1336) This is Manmaru Mix Version 3 model, you see this is a really, really good, really, really

- [00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=1342) high-quality cartoon model, I can say that, Manmaru Mix Version 3.

- [00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=1346) This is Meina Mix Version 1, this is also pretty decent model for its style.

- [00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=1351) This is Meina Pastel Version 6 model, let's compare both of them, there are some just

- [00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=1358) like minor differences, I don't know.

- [00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=1360) This is Meina Unreal, this is also almost the same, you see.

- [00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=1365) This is Milky Chicken model, yeah, this is the quality, not that great one actually,

- [00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=1371) decent but not, not sure.

- [00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=1373) Yeah, this is Mistoon Anime model, this is a really good anime model, you see, this is

- [00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=1377) almost like from animes, pretty decent quality.

- [00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=1380) This is Never Ending Dream model, not that a good one.

- [00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=1384) Next Photo Version 3, okay, this looks like a realistic model, but the quality is not

- [00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=1389) there, and I see some noisy images as well, you see, there are some really big noise.

- [00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=1396) It has different body shapes and somewhat different faces, but it also has a noise.

- [00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=1401) Okay, this is Non Plus Ultra Version 2 model, okay, this also has some noise.

- [00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=1406) This is Noo Sphere Version 4, it has a certain style and really good quality, but the style

- [00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=1412) is like this, if you like this style, that's a good one.

- [00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=1415) This is Noo Sphere Version 2, almost same, you see when I zoom in like this.

- [00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=1421) Okay, this is Objective Reality model, it is like this.

- [00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=1424) This is Only Realistic Version 3 model, it is like this, not very realistic.

- [00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=1430) This is Opiate Version 3 model, the images are like this, it's a decent style model,

- [00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=1436) but not that very much realistic.

- [00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=1438) This is Orange Chill Mix model, this is Paragon Version 1 model, you are seeing right now,

- [00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=1444) almost same face.

- [00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=1445) This is Pastel Mix, if you want this style, this is the model.

- [00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=1449) This is Photographer Alpha, let's look at the quality, the quality is decent, but almost

- [00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=1455) same pose and same person.

- [00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=1457) This is Photon Version 1 model, and this also looks like pretty much previous models, this

- [00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=1464) is the quality it has.

- [00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=1465) This is Photo Somnia Omega model, the output is like this, you see, almost same face, I

- [00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=1471) don't know how many times we have seen like this man.

- [00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=1474) This is PicX Real model, and it also looks like another merged model, this is its Version

- [00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=1481) 1.

- [00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=1482) Okay, this is Porous Rox Version 1, it has a really good style, if you are into this

- [00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=1488) style, it's a good one.

- [00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=1489) It looks like a little bit over-trained, for example, almost same man.

- [00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=1493) This is PVC Style model, and the output of this model is like this, you see, if you are

- [00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=1498) looking for this kind of output, pretty good one.

- [00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=1501) This is QGO Prompting Real Version 1, not that different from other models.

- [00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=1506) This is Raemu Mix Version 8, and this is its style.

- [00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=1511) This is Raemu Mix Version 4, you see, this is Real Dream Version 12, looking like other

- [00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=1517) models, not much different.

- [00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=1519) Real Cartoon 3D, not like a real cartoon, so this is its output.

- [00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=1524) Real Cartoon Anime, okay, this looks more like an anime.

- [00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=1529) This is Real Cartoon Pixar, okay, this is a really good one.

- [00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=1532) So, if you are looking for a Pixar model, Real Cartoon Pixar is really good.

- [00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=1537) You see, the quality is decent, it looks like a Pixar like 3D rendered, this is a good model

- [00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=1542) for this task, and remember, this is just photo of a man, nothing else in the prompt.

- [00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=1546) This is Real Cartoon Realistic model, okay, this is somewhat okay, not very realistic

- [00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=1552) but decent quality.

- [00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=1553) Yeah, okay, this is Real Dos Mix, doesn't look like a good model.

- [00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=1559) This is Realisian Version 5 model, not much like an Asian, but yeah, it's up to you.

- [00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=1565) This is Realistic Version 5.1, okay, there is some overfitting, some bad quality.

- [00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=1573) Realistic Vision is known to be best for realism, and it's really good, but I think that the

- [00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=1578) previous model were better than this one.

- [00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=1580) Okay, this is Realistic Digital Genius model, like this.

- [00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=1584) This is Realistic Fantasy Version 2, like this.

- [00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=1588) This is Realistic Version 6, okay, Realistic Version 6 and Realistic Version 5.1 has some

- [00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=1594) major difference, you see, Realistic Vision Version 6 has a huge amount of new training,

- [00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=1600) that's obvious.

- [00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=1601) Let's look at the Realistic Version 6, now this is good, this is really good, the only

- [00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=1605) problem is the face is almost the same, not much diversity, but the quality is really

- [00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=1611) decent.

- [00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=1612) Still, it's a choice, but this is looking pretty good, but I think I will prefer the

- [00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=1618) model that outputs different person in each image because that model is the most generalized

- [00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=1624) model.

- [00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=1625) This is Realistic Asians Version 7 model, it is decent, but not that great.

- [00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=1629) This is Real Life Version 4, this looks like another merged model.

- [00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=1633) This is Rev Animated Version 1.2.2, this model is not continuing anymore, but is a decent

- [00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=1641) model for that style.

- [00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=1642) This is RPG Version 5, this looks like biased to older persons, but it's decent, you see,

- [00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=1651) these are the images that it outputs.

- [00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=1653) This is Run Diffusion FX model, so if you want to train an older person, probably RPG

- [00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=1659) Version 5 will be a good choice, I think.

- [00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=1661) So this is Run Diffusion FX Photorealistic, let's see the quality, I see some noise, yes,

- [00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=1668) this model also has some noise, so I wouldn't prefer it.

- [00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=1671) This is Sals Realism, this is an extremely overfit model for like this fitness guys,

- [00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=1677) so this is not a generalized model.

- [00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=1678) Okay, this is Samaritan 3D Cartoon model, this is a really good model for this style,

- [00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=1684) I like it, a little bit looks like over trained, but if you are looking for this style, it

- [00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=1689) is pretty decent.

- [00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=1690) Okay, this is SDVN3 Real Art model, and you see, this is its output.

- [00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=1695) This is SDXL Unstable Diffusers Version 11 model, this is its name, but this is SD 1.5

- [00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=1701) based model, and this is the output it has.

- [00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=1705) This is Semi-Realistic Version 54, let's see the quality, not much like different, you

- [00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=1713) see, this is not a good one.

- [00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=1715) This is Serenity Version 2, it's also looking like the other models, a merged model probably.

- [00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=1721) This is Soft Realistic Version 155, it also looks like another merged model.

- [00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=1727) Okay, this is Stable Diffusion Version 1.5, which is the base model of all models that

- [00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=1732) you are seeing here, therefore it is a very bad quality, this is the official model.

- [00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=1737) This is Stoked Reality Version 2.2 model, you see the output is like this, not that

- [00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=1743) great.

- [00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=1744) This is Summershard Version 1, and it is pretty decent for this quality, this is a stylized

- [00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=1751) model.

- [00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=1752) This is SXZ Luma 0.9X model, you see, this is its output, not that great.

- [00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=1758) This is T3 2.5d Version 1 model, and not a great model.

- [00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=1764) This is 3T version 10 model.

- [00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=1767) Not a great one either.

- [00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=1769) This probably an Asian model.

- [00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=1771) This is the Truality Engine Pro model, the quality is like this, it is also looking like

- [00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=1776) another merged model.

- [00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=1778) This is TMND Mix SP Rainbow model, this is a decent model for this style, if you are

- [00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=1784) looking for that.

- [00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=1785) This is TMND Mix Version 7 model, it is like this.

- [00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=1790) Okay, this is Tooneame Version 1 model, and it is pretty decent quality too.

- [00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=1797) So this is another like toon models.

- [00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=1799) This is ToonYou model, this has a certain style, and it's a pretty decent good quality

- [00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=1805) model, as you are seeing right now.

- [00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=1806) This is Umbra Mix model, and this looks like another merged model, almost the same face.

- [00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=1813) This is Unyielding Grimoire model, you see it has a certain style, but it looks like

- [00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=1820) one of the models that we have seen.

- [00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=1822) This is 1.5 pruned CKPT, this is also the base model.

- [00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=1825) Okay, this is Vendo Photorealistic Version 2 model, and it doesn't look like that realistic.

- [00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=1832) This is Virtuos Mix Version 1 model, it has a certain style like this.

- [00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=1837) This is Wein Comic Version 1 model, and it is very decent for this style, if you are

- [00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=1842) looking for such style.

- [00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=1843) This is Wildcard X Version 2 model, looks like another merged model.

- [00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=1848) This is Wyvern Mix Version 9 model, this looks like a differently trained model, not like

- [00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=1855) a very merged model.

- [00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=1856) If you are going to need people like here, I think this is a decent model for such style.

- [00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=1863) Okay, this is XX Mix 9 Realistic model, and the output is like this, not very good.

- [00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=1869) This is YACAM SR16111 model, this looks like another merged model.

- [00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=1876) This is Yayoi Mix Version 2 model, not that a great model either.

- [00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=1880) This is Yes Mix model, it is not looking good.

- [00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=1884) This is Yazora Version 1 model, since it's a decent model, I think it is for this style.

- [00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=1891) And this is AniVerse Version 1 model, and it's also a pretty decent model, and the author

- [00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=1897) contacted me and told me that he is also going to release another one soon, and he said that

- [00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=1903) it will be even better.

- [00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=1905) Only this image is problematic, but the other ones are really decent quality.

- [00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=1909) So I am not going to also show all of the picture and image difference, but if you want

- [00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=1915) to see which models are more stylized, then you should try picture and image to see because

- [00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=1922) the prompt makes a difference.

- [00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=1925) When you use photo word, it will make the images more realistic.

- [00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=1928) So if you are going to compare stylized models, you will get much better results when you

- [00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=1934) type image of a man instead of photo of a man.

- [00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=1937) So this is the difference, I put them into the Patreon post, you can download them and

- [00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=1942) check them out.

- [00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=1943) You see, when I type image, the stylized models become much, much better because the photo

- [00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=1950) prompt will make them more like a realistic output, but when you make them image, you

- [00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=1956) will see the stylized models will get much better outputs.

- [00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=1960) So this is very crucial when you want to test stylized models versus realistic models.

- [00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=1966) For realistic models, you should test photo word; for stylized models, you should test

- [00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=1971) image or picture word.

- [00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=1973) You see, this is another image, this is another one, Raemu Mix.

- [00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=1977) So the stylized models will shine and look much better when you do image or picture prompt.

- [00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=1985) This is a really good tip for you, this is what I have discovered.

- [00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=1990) You see, when I type image, it is much better in this Samaritan model, so the image of a

- [00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=1996) man will perform much better for stylized 3D anime models.

- [00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=2001) That is the difference, this is ToonYou, you see the faces are different.

- [00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=2005) So this is a really, really important thing when you consider.

- [00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=2009) Okay, as a last step, I am going to compare 1024 to 1024, this is double the size of the

- [00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=2017) base resolution of SD 1.5 models.

- [00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=2020) However, if a model is already capable of higher resolution, that means that model has

- [00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=2027) more potential than the other models, but I will make my choice for SD 1.5 based on

- [00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=2033) 768 to 768 when I am searching for the best hyperparameters for DreamBooth training.

- [00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=2041) However, if a model has a base higher resolution, then it is better for us.

- [00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=2047) So what happens when you generate images in a higher resolution?

- [00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=2050) You will see repeating subject in the images, like here I typed photo of a man, but I got

- [00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=2056) two men here or two men here, so they are repeating, or you will see the anatomy is

- [00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=2062) broken like this, you see this is incorrect anatomy, incorrect anatomy, almost all images

- [00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=2067) are incorrect anatomy.

- [00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=2069) So the majority of the models cannot handle, as you are seeing right now, 1024 pixel images.

- [00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=2074) I noticed that the anime models are much better at high resolution, such as this one, but

- [00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=2080) the realistic models are usually generating very bad anatomy at 1024 to 1024, you see,

- [00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=2088) the anatomy is not that great, or here, the anime models are performing really good, but

- [00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=2093) they still also getting some errors.

- [00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=2095) Okay, you see bad anatomy, and let's check it out, another model, it also doesn't look

- [00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=2101) very accurate.

- [00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=2102) For example, this face, anime models performing good.

- [00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=2105) So in here, which model shines for the very best resolution?

- [00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=2110) Let's check it out quickly and I will tell you.

- [00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=2113) For example, this is also very bad one, and this is also bad one, the merge models will

- [00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=2118) all produce bad quality.

- [00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=2120) This is also another bad one.

- [00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=2121) Okay, this is also another.

- [00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=2123) Okay, yeah, this, some images are decent, but some are bad ones.

- [00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=2128) This also become very bad, you see, two persons, very bad anatomy, a lot of major errors.

- [00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=2134) This is also like that, major errors.

- [00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=2137) This is also very bad looking.

- [00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=2139) And let's see if there is any realistic model that can output at 1024 to 1024.

- [00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=2146) You see, major errors.

- [00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=2148) This will happen when you go with a very high resolution.

- [00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=2151) This was a decent model, but at 1024, it is also not very good.

- [00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=2155) The anime models are significantly performing better.

- [00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=2158) This is also very bad.

- [00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=2159) You see, this is also bad.

- [00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=2162) Very bad.

- [00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=2163) Okay, this is also bad anatomy.

- [00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=2164) You see, this was a bad anatomy.

- [00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=2167) There are some multiple subjects, bad anatomy.

- [00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=2169) Okay, this performed really, really bad.

- [00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=2172) Good.

- [00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=2173) This is Dark Sun model.

- [00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=2174) This is another model.

- [00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=2176) Uh, it's looking decent.

- [00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=2177) This is also erroneous, you see.

- [00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=2180) Deliberate.

- [00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=2181) Deliberate, let's see if there is a very good performing.

- [00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=2184) This is also bad.

- [00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=2186) Duc Haiten Retro.

- [00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=2188) Okay, this model significantly performs good for this resolution.

- [00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=2192) Duc Haiten, but the images are not like that we are looking for, and it also has some,

- [00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=2197) you see, this noise.

- [00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=2198) Okay, this is Epic PhotoGasm, which is one of the good models, and it is still performing

- [00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=2205) decent.

- [00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=2206) For example, the anatomy here is bad, but I think in this image, this one is looking

- [00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=2210) nice, and this one also looking nice.

- [00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=2213) So in some images, the anatomy is broken, but in some images, it is still good.

- [00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=2217) So this has a really high resolution having model.

- [00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=2219) Okay, this is Epic Realism Natural model, and the anatomy is not that great.

- [00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=2224) Okay, there are also some multiple subjects in this model.

- [00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=2228) This model, let's see.

- [00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=2241) the parts that you want because I have to be fast otherwise this will take hours, there

- [00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=2245) are just too many models.

- [00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=2248) Okay, this is Gui Realism Photo Version 1 model, this Guofeng model, and it came like

- [00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=2253) this at this resolution.

- [00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=2255) This is Hello Art Oil, wow, this model performed really good at this resolution, interesting.

- [00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=2265) So this is also another high-resolution model.

- [00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=2267) This has multiple subjects.

- [00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=2289) Hyperrealism Version 3 is really, really realistic, as you are seeing right now, I like it, it

- [00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=2295) handled this resolution perfect.

- [00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=2296) Okay, you see, this is also another merged model, and these merged models are epically

- [00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=2301) failing, as you are seeing right now.

- [00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=2303) Okay, this model also performed very well.

- [00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=2549) You see Realistic Vision Version 5 fails epically for anatomy, but Realistic Vision Version

- [00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=2554) 6 handles anatomy, but the problem is almost same person in every image.

- [00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=2558) You see, it is overfit.

- [00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=2561) Realistic Asians, yeah, here like this, not that great.

- [00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=2564) This is another merged model, it fails.

- [00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=2571) This model was epic, but it is not continuing.

- [00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=2574) Okay, this is all double subject, so this resolution was too big for this model.

- [00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=2581) Run Diffusion, not that great.

- [00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=2583) I see some major noise in every image, you see.

- [00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=2588) Noise, noise.

- [00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=2589) I don't know why they have it.

- [00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=2590) This model also all duplicated.

- [00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=2599) SDXL based version, you see all different images like these ones, but since this is

- [00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=2606) a very basic prompt, it is handling like this.

- [00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=2608) Refiner couldn't handle this resolution, interestingly.

- [00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=2610) This is SDVN3 Real Art, like this.

- [00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-oZn4H-aHQ&t=2616) So many major errors.
