OmniHuman will shake the AI world forever if get published and works as they claimed. This is literally the ultimate video model announced so far. It is not published yet but I will be following it very closely. I hope that they will publish models publicly so we can use locally hopefully. As soon as published I plan to make APP for this model hopefully and publish a tutorial.

The source of videos is here : [https://omnihuman-lab.github.io/](https://omnihuman-lab.github.io/)

The paper is here : [https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01061](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01061)

TL;DR: We propose an end-to-end multimodality-conditioned human video generation framework named OmniHuman, which can generate human videos based on a single human image and motion signals (e.g., audio only, video only, or a combination of audio and video). In OmniHuman, we introduce a multimodality motion conditioning mixed training strategy, allowing the model to benefit from data scaling up of mixed conditioning. This overcomes the issue that previous end-to-end approaches faced due to the scarcity of high-quality data. OmniHuman significantly outperforms existing methods, generating extremely realistic human videos based on weak signal inputs, especially audio. It supports image inputs of any aspect ratio, whether they are portraits, half-body, or full-body images, delivering more lifelike and high-quality results across various scenarios.

Generated Videos

OmniHuman supports various visual and audio styles. It can generate realistic human videos at any aspect ratio and body proportion (portrait, half-body, full-body all in one), with realism stemming from comprehensive aspects including motion, lighting, and texture details.

* Note that to generate all results on this page, only any single image and audio are required, except for the demo showcasing video and combined driving signals. For the sake of a clean layout, we have omitted the display of reference images, which are the first frame of the generated video in most cases.

Singing

OmniHuman can support various music styles and accommodate multiple body poses and singing forms. It can handle high-pitched songs and display different motion styles for different types of music. Please remember to select the highest video quality. The generated video quality also highly depends on the quality of the reference image.

Talking

OmniHuman can support input of any aspect ratio in terms of speech. It significantly improves the handling of gestures, which is a challenge for existing methods, and produces highly realistic results.

Diversity

In terms of input diversity, OmniHuman supports cartoons, artificial objects, animals, and challenging poses, ensuring motion characteristics match each style's unique features.

Compatibility with Video Driving

Due to OmniHuman's mixed condition training characteristics, it can support not only audio driving but also video driving to mimic specific video actions, as well as combined audio and video driving to control specific body parts like recent methods. Below, we demonstrate these capabilities.
