### Video Transcription


- [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvw8RnKRxj0&t=0) Another product made better&nbsp; by AI is Google Photos.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvw8RnKRxj0&t=4) We introduced it at IO in 2015. It was&nbsp; one of our first AI native products.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvw8RnKRxj0&t=11) Breakthroughs in machine learning made it possible&nbsp; to search your photos for things like people,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvw8RnKRxj0&t=17) sunsets or waterfalls. Of course, we want you to&nbsp; do more than just search photos. We also want to&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvw8RnKRxj0&t=24) help you make them better. In fact, every month,&nbsp; 1.7 billion images are edited in Google Photos.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvw8RnKRxj0&t=32) AI advancements give us more powerful ways to&nbsp; do this. For example, Magic Eraser, launched&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvw8RnKRxj0&t=39) first on Pixel, uses AI-powered computational&nbsp; photography to remove unwanted distractions.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvw8RnKRxj0&t=47) And later this year, using a combination of&nbsp; semantic understanding and generative AI,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvw8RnKRxj0&t=52) you can do much more with a new experience&nbsp; called Magic Editor. Let's have a look.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvw8RnKRxj0&t=60) Say you're on a hike and you stop to&nbsp; take a photo in front of a waterfall.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvw8RnKRxj0&t=64) You wish you had taken your bag off for the photo,&nbsp; so let's go ahead and remove that back strap.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvw8RnKRxj0&t=70) The photo feels a bit dark, so&nbsp; you can improve the lighting.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvw8RnKRxj0&t=75) And maybe you want to even get rid of some clouds&nbsp; to make it feel as sunny as you remember it.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvw8RnKRxj0&t=84) Looking even closer, you wish you had&nbsp; posed so it looks like you're really&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvw8RnKRxj0&t=88) catching the water in your hand.&nbsp; No problem, you can adjust that.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvw8RnKRxj0&t=101) There you go. Let's look at one more photo. This&nbsp; is a great photo, but as a parent, you always&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvw8RnKRxj0&t=108) want your kid at the center of it all. And it&nbsp; looks like the balloons got cut off in this one,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvw8RnKRxj0&t=113) so you can go ahead and reposition the birthday&nbsp; boy. Magic Editor automatically recreates parts of&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvw8RnKRxj0&t=121) the bench and balloons that were not captured in&nbsp; the original shot. As a finishing touch, you can&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvw8RnKRxj0&t=127) punch up the sky. It changes the lighting in the&nbsp; rest of the photo so the edit feels consistent.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvw8RnKRxj0&t=133) It's truly magical. We are excited to roll out&nbsp; Magic Editor in Google Photos later this year.
