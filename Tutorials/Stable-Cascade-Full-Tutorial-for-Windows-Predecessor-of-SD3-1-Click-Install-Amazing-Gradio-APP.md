Here summary of Stable Cascade Paper:

The paper titled "Wurstchen: An Efficient Architecture for Large-Scale Text-to-Image Diffusion Models," presented at ICLR 2024, introduces a novel text-to-image synthesis architecture named Wurstchen. The architecture is notable for its efficiency, significantly reducing the computational resources and time required for training while maintaining high image quality.

Key Contributions:

Novel Architecture: Wurstchen employs a three-stage architecture that drastically lowers computational demands. This is achieved by using a highly compressed latent space that guides the diffusion process, thereby reducing the dimensionality and complexity involved in image generation.

Efficiency and Effectiveness: The model is trained on a very low-dimensional latent space with a high compression ratio, which allows it to achieve state-of-the-art performance with considerably less computational cost‚Äîonly 24,602 A100-GPU hours compared to 200,000 GPU hours required by Stable Diffusion 2.1.

High-Quality Image Synthesis: Despite the reduced computational requirements, Wurstchen competes favorably in terms of image quality against other state-of-the-art models. It also features faster inference capabilities, significantly cutting down both costs and carbon footprint.

Architecture Details:

Stage C: Starts with a text-conditional Latent Diffusion Model (LDM) that generates a low-dimensional latent representation of the image.

Stage B: This representation conditions another LDM that operates in a higher-dimensional latent space.

Stage A: A Vector-quantized Generative Adversarial Network (VQGAN) decoder then decodes the latent image to produce the final high-resolution image.

Training and Evaluation:

The training process is conducted in reverse, starting from Stage A to C.

The model shows similar fidelity to other high-resource models in both visual and numerical evaluations.

Wurstchen was evaluated using automated metrics and human feedback, demonstrating its ability to generate high-quality images efficiently.

Environmental and Computational Efficiency:

The model significantly reduces the GPU hours and carbon emissions associated with training large-scale image synthesis models.

This efficiency makes Wurstchen a more accessible and environmentally friendly option for researchers and practitioners.

Conclusion:

The Wurstchen model represents a significant advancement in the field of text-to-image synthesis, emphasizing the importance of performance and computational efficiency. The authors believe this work will encourage further research into creating more sustainable and cost-effective generative models.

- [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cYhalUUsc&t=0) Greetings, everyone. In this video, I am going to&nbsp; introduce you to the latest Stability AI-released&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cYhalUUsc&t=7) Stable Cascade model. The weights are released.&nbsp; I know that there is Stable Diffusion 3, but&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cYhalUUsc&t=13) its weights are not released. Its models are not&nbsp; released yet. Therefore, today I am going to show&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cYhalUUsc&t=20) you how to use this amazing model. The weights,&nbsp; the models published by Stability AI. It is called&nbsp;as

- [00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cYhalUUsc&t=28) Stable Cascade, and it is really amazing. We have&nbsp; developed an amazing Gradio application for this&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cYhalUUsc&t=34) model. So this model right now works on even 5GB&nbsp; VRAM-having GPUs. Even on older GPUs. Therefore,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cYhalUUsc&t=43) even if you have a low VRAM-having GPU, you will&nbsp; be able to use this amazing model both locally,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cYhalUUsc&t=51) and if you don't have any GPU, you will be able&nbsp; to use it on the cloud. Because we also have cloud&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cYhalUUsc&t=58) installers. We also have a Kaggle notebook. So you&nbsp; can use this on your computer or on the cloud as&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cYhalUUsc&t=65) you wish. In today's video, I am going to show&nbsp; you how to one-click install this amazing Gradio&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cYhalUUsc&t=74) application and start using Stable Cascade on your&nbsp; computer on Windows. So the application that we&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cYhalUUsc&t=80) have developed for Stable Cascade is amazing.&nbsp; It includes all the features that you need.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cYhalUUsc&t=86) It supports multi-line prompting. You see, each&nbsp; line is treated as a separate prompt. It supports&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cYhalUUsc&t=92) negative prompt. It supports 275 different styles,&nbsp; so you can generate images in any style that you&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cYhalUUsc&t=99) wish. It supports "Loop all styles." This is a&nbsp; very necessary feature if you want to test all&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cYhalUUsc&t=105) of the styles on your prompt and see which one is&nbsp; performing best. It supports randomized seed. It&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cYhalUUsc&t=111) supports different resolutions. It supports batch&nbsp; size and also the number of images to generate. So&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cYhalUUsc&t=116) you can generate 100 images, 200 images with your&nbsp; prompts as you wish. It supports CFG values for&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cYhalUUsc&t=123) prior guidance scale and decoder guidance scale.&nbsp; Stable Cascade works with two steps. It is prior&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cYhalUUsc&t=130) steps and also decoder steps. There are also prior&nbsp; inference steps and decoder inference steps. So&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cYhalUUsc&t=136) the guidance scale determines how much it should&nbsp; follow the prompts, and the steps, as we know,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cYhalUUsc&t=142) how many steps it will take to render the image.&nbsp; Moreover, this application saves the metadata of&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cYhalUUsc&t=150) every generated image. So you can load any image&nbsp; from your outputs, and you can see the metadata of&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cYhalUUsc&t=160) that image like this. It also allows you to load&nbsp; and set metadata settings with one click. So all&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cYhalUUsc&t=167) the settings that you have used to generate that&nbsp; image will be loaded here. So how are we going to&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cYhalUUsc&t=173) install this application on Windows? To download&nbsp; and install this application on your Windows,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cYhalUUsc&t=179) you need to go to the very bottom of this post and&nbsp; download the latest version attached zip file. The&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cYhalUUsc&t=186) link to this post will be in the description of&nbsp; the video. So click the link at the bottom. This&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cYhalUUsc&t=191) is the attachment link. Then cut the downloaded&nbsp; zip file. Move into the folder wherever you want&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cYhalUUsc&t=197) to install. I'm going to install into my F drive. Right-click, extract the Stable Cascade version&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cYhalUUsc&t=202) 12, then enter inside here. So at this point,&nbsp; you just need to double-click windows_install.bat&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cYhalUUsc&t=209) file, and it will start the automatic installation&nbsp; for you. However, there are a few requirements&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cYhalUUsc&t=214) that you have to do before starting to install&nbsp; this amazing application. You need to have Python&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cYhalUUsc&t=221) 3.10 and Git to be installed. How are you going to be&nbsp; sure that you have installed them? When you type&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cYhalUUsc&t=228) "python," you should see 3.10.x. I suggest 11.&nbsp; 11 is working the best one. If you have multiple&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cYhalUUsc&t=236) Python versions but also installed Python&nbsp; Launcher, which is the default installation,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cYhalUUsc&t=242) it will still work. And you also need to have&nbsp; installed Git. So when you type "git" into a&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cYhalUUsc&t=247) CMD window, you should get a Git output like this.&nbsp; If you don't know how to install Python and Git,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cYhalUUsc&t=253) I have an excellent tutorial that covers all of&nbsp; these step by step. The link is here: Python, Git,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cYhalUUsc&t=258) FFmpeg, and C++ tools. Just follow this amazing,&nbsp; very recent tutorial and install everything shown&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cYhalUUsc&t=266) here exactly as that way. And you will be able&nbsp; to use all of these applications, very well,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cYhalUUsc&t=274) all of the AI applications, open-source applications, very well,&nbsp; excellent, without any issues. And meanwhile,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cYhalUUsc&t=281) our installer is working at the behind of the scenes. It is&nbsp; installing everything for us automatically. So the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cYhalUUsc&t=288) installation has been completed. Scroll to the top&nbsp; and see if there are any errors or not. And you&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cYhalUUsc&t=295) see there are no errors. The installation were very&nbsp; smooth. If you encounter any issues, right-click&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cYhalUUsc&t=301) here, edit, and select all, then right-click,&nbsp; edit, copy, and then send me the entire output&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cYhalUUsc&t=309) as an email or from Discord so I can see whether&nbsp; there are any errors or not. Then all you need&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cYhalUUsc&t=314) to do is go back to your installation folder and&nbsp; just double-click and start the application with&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cYhalUUsc&t=322) Windows_Start_App.bat file. It will ask you options.&nbsp; Depending on your VRAM select the option.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cYhalUUsc&t=330) So I have 3090. Therefore, I have 24 gigabytes. So&nbsp; I'm going to go with the default 1+1 option, which&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cYhalUUsc&t=338) is the best option. If you have 12 gigabytes,&nbsp; you can try this, but it may be slow. So you can&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cYhalUUsc&t=343) go with 1+2. If you have a 6-gigabyte GPU, you&nbsp; can go with 1+3. And the application interface&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cYhalUUsc&t=351) has started and is ready to use. When you first time generate&nbsp;something it will download all&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cYhalUUsc&t=358) of the models into the Hugging Face cache folder.&nbsp; Currently, I have already downloaded everything.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cYhalUUsc&t=365) And I have another instance. So I will close&nbsp; it because it is using my VRAM. And where are&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cYhalUUsc&t=370) these models downloaded? They are downloaded&nbsp; into my default Hugging Face cache folder.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cYhalUUsc&t=376) It is inside my R drive in here. So how many&nbsp; gigabytes are they? They are about 20 gigabytes&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cYhalUUsc&t=382) plus 10 gigabytes. So 30 gigabytes. If you don't&nbsp; know how to set your Hugging Face cache folder,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cYhalUUsc&t=388) I have an excellent tutorial video about it. So&nbsp; open this link. In this video, when you check&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cYhalUUsc&t=394) the description and search for "Hugging Face,"&nbsp; let me show you, you will that see where I have shown&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cYhalUUsc&t=401) how to set the Hugging Face cache folder. So you&nbsp; can follow this tutorial to learn more about it.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cYhalUUsc&t=407) And we got our output image. So we have a lot of&nbsp; presets that you can try. For example, let's try&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cYhalUUsc&t=414) "caricature" and generate. You can also do all of&nbsp; the styles and see which style is performing best.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cYhalUUsc&t=422) So from these values, which one should you change?&nbsp; You can change the width and height of the output.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cYhalUUsc&t=427) You can also increase decoder inference steps.&nbsp; This is improving the quality. I have played with&nbsp;a little bit

- [00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cYhalUUsc&t=434) prior inference steps count, prior guidance scale,&nbsp; and decoder guidance scale.

- [00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cYhalUUsc&t=439) They&nbsp;weren't that good to make changes. So it is&nbsp; up to you to play with them and see. You can&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cYhalUUsc&t=445) also randomize seed to get different outputs each&nbsp; time when you generate. Moreover, in the image&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cYhalUUsc&t=451) metadata, you can load the any image that you want,&nbsp; like this one, and click "Load and set metadata&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cYhalUUsc&t=459) settings" and regenerate the image. Okay, so&nbsp; click "Load and set metadata settings." Make sure&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cYhalUUsc&t=464) that "Randomize seed" is not selected, because it&nbsp; will use the same seed, hit generate, and it will&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cYhalUUsc&t=469) generate the same image with the same settings.&nbsp; This is very useful. Actually, I find that "Loop&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cYhalUUsc&t=476) all styles" is very useful as well. Moreover,&nbsp; "Randomize seed" is very useful as well. When you&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cYhalUUsc&t=482) generate more than one image, it will increment&nbsp; the seed, so it will generate different images&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cYhalUUsc&t=488) each time. And you see we got the same image.&nbsp; Let's generate this image with another style.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cYhalUUsc&t=494) We have 275 styles. Let's try "cell-shaded art"&nbsp; and let's generate three images and hit generate.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cYhalUUsc&t=502) Moreover, you can see what is happening on the CMD&nbsp; window. You see the final prompt became like this,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cYhalUUsc&t=507) and the final negative prompt became like this.&nbsp; It is also showing how many images it is going to&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cYhalUUsc&t=512) generate and this is the current image that&nbsp; is being generated. As soon as the image is&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cYhalUUsc&t=517) generated, it will be saved in the outputs&nbsp; folder. You can click this icon to load the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cYhalUUsc&t=522) outputs folder. However, if you are on RunPod or&nbsp; on a cloud service like Kaggle, it will not work.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cYhalUUsc&t=529) If you are using Massed Compute, it will work&nbsp; if you are using their thinlink client. I will&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cYhalUUsc&t=534) show in another video that I'm going to make. So&nbsp; you can open the generated images and look at them&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cYhalUUsc&t=540) as soon as they are generated. You don't need to&nbsp; wait for this process to be completed. They will&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cYhalUUsc&t=545) be immediately saved after whenever the generation&nbsp; has been completed. You can watch the status on&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cYhalUUsc&t=552) the CMD window, and you see images are getting&nbsp; generated. Each seed will generate different&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cYhalUUsc&t=558) images, as you are seeing, and all three images&nbsp; are generated. You can scroll them through from&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cYhalUUsc&t=565) here, you can see each one of them, you can&nbsp; click here to download them. So let's generate&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cYhalUUsc&t=569) with all styles and see what is the process is. Click&nbsp; generate. And you will see that it is generating&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cYhalUUsc&t=576) 828 images. Why? Because we set the application&nbsp; to generate three images for every style here,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cYhalUUsc&t=583) and the images are getting generated. So far, it&nbsp; has generated seven images. We can see the images&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cYhalUUsc&t=589) here. This will take, of course, a lot of time,&nbsp; so you can try this on your computer and see the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0cYhalUUsc&t=596) results. If you have any questions, any demand,&nbsp; reply to this video, message me from Patreon.&nbsp;&nbsp;
