Our tools significantly enhance the visual impact of presentations, advertisements, websites, and social media posts.

Is SupPixel AI free? What are the subscription plans for SupPixel AI?

SupPixel AI offers three subscription plans: Starter, Basic, and Pro. Due to the high computational costs, we currently cannot offer a free trial. However, for just $5, you can explore our top-tier image processing models with the Starter plan, which provides 100 credits. For users needing more credits, the Basic plan offers 2000 credits per month at $39. The Pro plan is designed for professional users who require a higher number of credits.

What does credit mean in SupPixel AI?

In SupPixel AI, service usage is measured in units of credits. Credit consumption is calculated based on the original image's pixel count and the upscale factor, ensuring fair usage. For example, processing a 1080p Full HD image typically costs 2 to 4 credits, while a 4K image costs around 15 to 20 credits. The formula for calculating credits is: (cost per AI computation) x (input image pixel count) x (upscaler factor)^2 / 1024^2.

How is SupPixel AI priced?

SupPixel AI utilizes the most advanced AI models, providing unique processing effects that require significant computing resources. Consequently, the pricing of SupPixel AI is primarily determined by the cost of computation.

### Video Transcription


- [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JajPVWMt2Lk&t=0) Greetings everyone. Today I am going to introduce&nbsp; you the SUPIR online by the SUPIR original&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JajPVWMt2Lk&t=6) developers. If you had watched my previous&nbsp; tutorials, you will know by now that the SUPIR&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JajPVWMt2Lk&t=14) is the ultimate upscaler that no one can compete&nbsp; with. Both in the paid upscalers or in the open&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JajPVWMt2Lk&t=23) source upscalers, from this image to this image&nbsp; is possible with SUPIR. It is just mind-blowing,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JajPVWMt2Lk&t=30) and now the original authors, the developers&nbsp; of the SUPIR, started an online website where&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JajPVWMt2Lk&t=37) you can use the SUPIR online on cloud without&nbsp; having any GPU. It is currently a paid service,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JajPVWMt2Lk&t=45) but they contacted me and told me that they&nbsp; are going to use the funds they generated on&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JajPVWMt2Lk&t=51) this service to develop SUPIR version 2 and most&nbsp; awaited SUPIR video. So I have prepared an amazing&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JajPVWMt2Lk&t=59) public Patreon article. The link will be in the&nbsp; description of the video. This is a public post;&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JajPVWMt2Lk&t=64) you don't need to be my Patreon member or you&nbsp; don't need to register Patreon. The link of&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JajPVWMt2Lk&t=69) SUPIR online is here. Just click this link to go&nbsp; to the website. You need to register and also set&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JajPVWMt2Lk&t=76) up some billing. Then you will be able to start&nbsp; using it. For using it, we have workbench here.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JajPVWMt2Lk&t=82) The link is here. The interface is very simple.&nbsp; You just upload your image which one you want to&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JajPVWMt2Lk&t=88) upscale. For example, this is the original image&nbsp; that I have used. You set the upscale factor from&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JajPVWMt2Lk&t=94) here. Since this is a very low resolution image,&nbsp; I am going to first upscale it. Then I am going to&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JajPVWMt2Lk&t=99) continue upscaling the original upscaled image.&nbsp; There are sampler, lighting, balance, ultimate&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JajPVWMt2Lk&t=106) perception, prioritizing, fidelity, quality. I have&nbsp; tested all of this, but by default settings it is&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JajPVWMt2Lk&t=112) working pretty good as well. So this image is&nbsp; originally 330 pixels to 277 pixels. Therefore,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JajPVWMt2Lk&t=120) I have upscaled it to 4x first with ultimate&nbsp; perception, the best quality, and the fidelity&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JajPVWMt2Lk&t=126) option here because I want the best resemblance&nbsp; to the original image with texture richness 1 and&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JajPVWMt2Lk&t=132) creativity 0. You also need to describe an image&nbsp; description. For image description, I have used&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JajPVWMt2Lk&t=140) the Claude 3.5. It is free on poe.com.&nbsp; The link is here. Just upload your image and&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JajPVWMt2Lk&t=148) you can use this simple prompt: "Caption this&nbsp; image in details," and the Claude will provide&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JajPVWMt2Lk&t=153) you a description for your image. The testing&nbsp; prompts are shown here. So let's copy this,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JajPVWMt2Lk&t=160) paste image description here and create, and it&nbsp; will upscale image for you. You don't need a GPU&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JajPVWMt2Lk&t=166) for this. So I already have done a huge amount of&nbsp; testing for this creature and this real image. The&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JajPVWMt2Lk&t=173) test results are posted on HuggingFace as a zip&nbsp; file. You can download from here and here. The&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JajPVWMt2Lk&t=178) zip files links are in the post. So what is inside&nbsp; this zip file? Inside this zip file, you will find&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JajPVWMt2Lk&t=184) all the generated images with their configuration.&nbsp; So what does this configuration mean? For example,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JajPVWMt2Lk&t=191) let's open this image, and this image turned&nbsp; that tiny image into this amazing image. You&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JajPVWMt2Lk&t=198) will notice that there will be some hallucinations&nbsp; like this. You can easily delete them and then you&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JajPVWMt2Lk&t=204) can remove the background. Let's also do this.&nbsp; For example, let's save this like this. Then for&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JajPVWMt2Lk&t=210) removing the background, we also have an amazing&nbsp; new state-of-the-art background remover BiRefNet.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JajPVWMt2Lk&t=216) Just click here. So you can download and use this&nbsp; background remover, or you can use any background&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JajPVWMt2Lk&t=222) remover as well. Let me start BiRefNet and show you&nbsp; how it is going to remove the background, but this&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JajPVWMt2Lk&t=229) is a very simple background so you can remove it&nbsp; with any software. Currently, it doesn't support&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JajPVWMt2Lk&t=233) upscaling without any background. So let's remove&nbsp; the background of this image. Let's just drag and&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JajPVWMt2Lk&t=240) drop this and we just need to do single image&nbsp; process. It is going to remove the background&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JajPVWMt2Lk&t=245) with maximum best possible quality, but since this&nbsp; is a simple image, you can use your tool to remove&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JajPVWMt2Lk&t=252) background. You can even use the Paint.NET like&nbsp; this. However, using such state-of-the-art AI&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JajPVWMt2Lk&t=259) model may yield better borders and results. This&nbsp; is also super fast background remover. Since we&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JajPVWMt2Lk&t=266) are first time running it, it is loading the&nbsp; model. Then and also since this image is huge,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JajPVWMt2Lk&t=271) it is going to take more time than usual. So&nbsp; what is the resolution of this image? This image&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JajPVWMt2Lk&t=276) resolution is 3960 pixels to 3324 pixels from 330&nbsp; pixels to 277 pixels. So this is the difference of&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JajPVWMt2Lk&t=287) upscale with SUPIR model. It is just mind-blowing&nbsp; and the background removed image is generated. So&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JajPVWMt2Lk&t=295) this is how this state-of-the-art model removes&nbsp; the background. If you own Photoshop, you can of&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JajPVWMt2Lk&t=301) course use Photoshop, but this model is able to&nbsp; remove such harder backgrounds as well. Anyway,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JajPVWMt2Lk&t=306) this is not the case of this tutorial. So I also&nbsp; have imgslis. Let's go to them. They are&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JajPVWMt2Lk&t=312) also in this post. So this post that I will&nbsp; share on the description is very important.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JajPVWMt2Lk&t=317) You will find almost all of the options here. So&nbsp; you can compare like the effect of creativity.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JajPVWMt2Lk&t=323) For example, let's select the ultimate fidelity&nbsp; standard texture 1 and let's select the ultimate&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JajPVWMt2Lk&t=329) fidelity standard texture 1 and creativity 1. With&nbsp; this way, you can compare the effect and impact of&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JajPVWMt2Lk&t=337) each feature on the SUPIR online website. So&nbsp; this will help you significantly to see the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JajPVWMt2Lk&t=345) difference of each option. I uploaded both the&nbsp; real image and also this creature image. So you&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JajPVWMt2Lk&t=352) can see the impact of each option on each type of&nbsp; image. For example, let's look at the texture 3&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JajPVWMt2Lk&t=359) and creativity 3 difference. You can see how much&nbsp; difference it makes. The texture 3 and creativity&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JajPVWMt2Lk&t=366) 3 adds a lot of more details. Of course, there&nbsp; will be some new features like this. So what&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JajPVWMt2Lk&t=372) you can do, you can reduce the creativity and go&nbsp; with higher texture. It will add lesser amount&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JajPVWMt2Lk&t=377) of details but it will reduce the hallucinations&nbsp; as well. Let's go with the texture 8 for example.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JajPVWMt2Lk&t=384) Okay, the texture 8 is adding a lot of details as&nbsp; you can see. This part is not important. You can&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JajPVWMt2Lk&t=390) remove them easily. I didn't remove so you can&nbsp; see how much details it adds. Let's compare with&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JajPVWMt2Lk&t=395) the original. So the left one was the original&nbsp; beginning image and the right one is the final&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JajPVWMt2Lk&t=401) image we get. It is just mind-blowing as you are&nbsp; seeing. This was a 2 times upscale. For some&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JajPVWMt2Lk&t=407) images, making 2 times upscale may be better,&nbsp; but for this real image I didn't find it better.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JajPVWMt2Lk&t=412) For example, I downscaled the original image then&nbsp; I upscaled it twice. The first upscale yielded&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JajPVWMt2Lk&t=419) this image, then the second time upscale yielded&nbsp; this image. So for this real image, 2 times&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JajPVWMt2Lk&t=427) upscale didn't work as expected, but going from&nbsp; original to the 3 times upscale yielded the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JajPVWMt2Lk&t=434) best results. However, for this creature, first I&nbsp; have upscaled it to 4 times like this from this&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JajPVWMt2Lk&t=441) left original to the 4 times upscale with&nbsp; maximum fidelity being loyal to the original&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JajPVWMt2Lk&t=448) image. Then I used this base image to upscale it&nbsp; 3 times more. So you just upload your image,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JajPVWMt2Lk&t=455) set the description, set the sampler. Ultimate is&nbsp; best. Set the prioritizing for such images like&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JajPVWMt2Lk&t=461) creature. The quality works better. Fidelity may&nbsp; work better for real images. Photo type standard&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JajPVWMt2Lk&t=468) and old photo. When you pick the old photo, if&nbsp; it is not an old photo, it will break the image.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JajPVWMt2Lk&t=475) Let me show you. So you will see that since&nbsp; this image is not an old photo, it breaks the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JajPVWMt2Lk&t=480) image like this. So use the standard. Texture&nbsp; richness adds texture details and creativity&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JajPVWMt2Lk&t=487) adds new features that doesn't exist. So it is&nbsp; pretty simple. Select the ultimate perception,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JajPVWMt2Lk&t=493) select the fidelity for real images, select the&nbsp; quality for images like this, use standard photo,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JajPVWMt2Lk&t=499) add more texture richness for such images&nbsp; like creature, or for real images you may&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JajPVWMt2Lk&t=505) want to reduce. You can also add creativity and&nbsp; make a good description of the image. Then when&nbsp;&nbsp;
