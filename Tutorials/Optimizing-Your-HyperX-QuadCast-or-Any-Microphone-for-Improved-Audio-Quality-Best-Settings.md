### Video Transcription


- [00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmI5amfgydA&t=1) Greetings, everyone. My name is Dr. Furkan&nbsp; Gözükara. This video is a follow-up to my&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmI5amfgydA&t=6) review and unboxing of the HyperX QuadCast&nbsp; HX-MICQC-BK microphone. In this video,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmI5amfgydA&t=12) I will demonstrate how to achieve the best&nbsp; sound quality with this microphone by using&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmI5amfgydA&t=17) the optimal settings and configuration.&nbsp; Currently, my microphone is set to Cardioid&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmI5amfgydA&t=22) mode with the sensitivity set to medium as shown&nbsp; in this image. Okay, as you can see right now,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmI5amfgydA&t=29) I do not have any audio input filters enabled in&nbsp; OBS Studio. However, NVIDIA Broadcast AI Assisted&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmI5amfgydA&t=36) Room Echo Removal and Noise Removal filters&nbsp; are turned on. As shown, as can be seen here.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmI5amfgydA&t=43) Let me quickly show you the settings of&nbsp; OBS Studio. Currently, I am recording.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmI5amfgydA&t=49) Okay, this is the settings of audio input. As&nbsp; you can see, sample rate is 48 kHz, channels are&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmI5amfgydA&t=58) stereo, and other settings are as default. Decay&nbsp; rate is fast, peak meter type is true, peak higher&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmI5amfgydA&t=64) CPU usage. The output mode is video bit rate.&nbsp; It is not important for the voice. Audio bit&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmI5amfgydA&t=71) rate is 192, as you can see, and I am using the&nbsp; other settings. For the properties audio input,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmI5amfgydA&t=79) you see the device is selected as microphone&nbsp; NVIDIA Broadcast. This is important. When you want&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmI5amfgydA&t=84) to use NVIDIA Broadcast, which I will explain, you&nbsp; need to set output for OBS Studio as like this,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmI5amfgydA&t=91) otherwise it won't work. And finally, I have&nbsp; no filters for audio input capture. Okay.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmI5amfgydA&t=101) So now I will test each one of the polar&nbsp; patterns and let's see how they are behaving.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmI5amfgydA&t=109) Okay, right now my microphone is set to&nbsp; stereo polar pattern, which is the first one,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmI5amfgydA&t=114) as can be seen here. Its sound direction&nbsp; is like this, and this is how it sounds.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmI5amfgydA&t=122) Okay, let's do some tests. 1, 2,&nbsp; 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. Okay.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmI5amfgydA&t=131) Okay, now I have turned off room echo&nbsp; removal and noise removal. So let's do&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmI5amfgydA&t=136) another test and we are currently still in the&nbsp; stereo mode. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmI5amfgydA&t=146) Okay, now our polar pattern is omnidirectional and&nbsp; the room echo removal and the noise removal are&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmI5amfgydA&t=155) activated. So let's do a test. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,&nbsp; 7, 8, 9, 10. Okay, I have the same with the room&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmI5amfgydA&t=165) echo removal and noise removal. We are still in&nbsp; the omnidirectional. Let's do another test. 1, 2,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmI5amfgydA&t=171) 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. Okay, now we are in the&nbsp; cardioid mode. In the cardioid mode. There is one&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmI5amfgydA&t=181) very important thing that you have to consider.&nbsp; The position of the microphone has to be like&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmI5amfgydA&t=188) this. Okay. This is the side that cardioid mode&nbsp; will work best. You see the cardioid mode gets&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmI5amfgydA&t=199) voice from the front and this is the front side of&nbsp; the microphone. Okay, if you turn it upside down,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmI5amfgydA&t=207) then your sound will be much worse. Let&nbsp; me do that. Okay, before doing that,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmI5amfgydA&t=212) let's make a test first. Okay, and 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,&nbsp; 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. Now I will reverse the microphone.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmI5amfgydA&t=223) Okay, the microphone is now positioned like&nbsp; this to me. Let's do another test. 1, 2, 3,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmI5amfgydA&t=230) 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. Okay, now the microphone&nbsp; is positioned like this and I have turned off&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmI5amfgydA&t=240) the room echo removal and the noise removal. So&nbsp; let's do a test. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmI5amfgydA&t=250) Okay, now we are at the bi-directional mode and we&nbsp; have enabled the room echo removal and the noise&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmI5amfgydA&t=255) removal. Let's do a test. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8,&nbsp; 9, 10. Okay, now I have turned off the room echo&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmI5amfgydA&t=264) removal and the noise removal. Let's do another&nbsp; test. We are still in the bi-directional mode. 1,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmI5amfgydA&t=270) 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. Okay, we are back&nbsp; to our best settings. So our best settings are&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmI5amfgydA&t=278) cardioid mode and room echo removal and&nbsp; noise removal are enabled. So how do you&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmI5amfgydA&t=284) install NVIDIA Broadcast? Just type to Google&nbsp; NVIDIA Broadcast like this and there is download&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmI5amfgydA&t=294) link as you can see here. You can download it&nbsp; and after you have opened it, just like this,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmI5amfgydA&t=302) set your microphone here and enable them. And&nbsp; don't forget to set your output to microphone&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmI5amfgydA&t=311) NVIDIA Broadcast from properties of OBS Studio.&nbsp; And for one final test, I will turn off the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmI5amfgydA&t=321) NVIDIA Broadcast and enable the noise filter&nbsp; of the OBS Studio. And so you can compare it.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmI5amfgydA&t=328) Okay, now the room echo removal and noise removal&nbsp; of the NVIDIA Broadcast is disabled. However,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmI5amfgydA&t=335) as can be seen in this image, noise suppression of&nbsp; the OBS Studio is enabled. And let's do a test. 1,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmI5amfgydA&t=344) 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. Alright, I hope&nbsp; you have enjoyed our video. Please subscribe&nbsp;&nbsp;
