### Video Transcription


- [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq9KUc4NnwE&t=0) One of my students asked me to how he can&nbsp; disable his ethernet card with C# code.

- [00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq9KUc4NnwE&t=5) So I have asked it to ChatGPT as you can see&nbsp; here. It has provided me an answer but it wasn't&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq9KUc4NnwE&t=12) working. So I said that and ni doesn't have&nbsp; disable method. So it generated another

- [00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq9KUc4NnwE&t=19) answer for me as can be seen here and then&nbsp; I have said that what is the using for&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq9KUc4NnwE&t=26) INetworkLinkLayerInfo? It was missing in the&nbsp; references. Then it has given me an answer but it&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq9KUc4NnwE&t=34) was still missing in System.Net.NetworkInformation. So I asked again and finally the ChatGPT has&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq9KUc4NnwE&t=42) fixed its all errors and provided the correct&nbsp; answer as can be seen here. This is how you can&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq9KUc4NnwE&t=50) utilize ChatGPT to improve the output of the&nbsp; code that it provides. Thank you for watching.
