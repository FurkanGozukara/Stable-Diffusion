#Firefly, #Adobe‚Äôs family of innovative generative AI models, launched six weeks ago with an initial focus on the generation of images and text effects. It has quickly became one of the most successful beta launches in Adobe‚Äôs history, with beta users generating over 100 million assets. Since its launch, Firefly has been expanded to support vector recoloring and generative fill.  Firefly‚Äôs first model is trained on Adobe Stock images, openly licensed content and other public domain content without copyright restrictions. Enterprises will be able to extend Firefly with their own inventive collateral in order to generate content that includes the company‚Äôs images, vectors and brand language. The integration of Firefly across Adobe Experience Cloud applications will allow marketing organizations to use Firefly to accelerate their content supply chain production.

What are some uses for AI generators?

AI generators like Firefly can enhance creativity by giving people new ways to imagine, experiment, and bring their ideas to life. Firefly is unique because Adobe intends it to be more than an AI text-to-image generator. As part of Creative Cloud, we plan for Firefly to supplement the creative tools Adobe creators know and love with text-based editing and generation of a variety of media, from still images to video to 3D, as well as ‚Äúcreative building blocks‚Äù like brushes, vectors, textures, and more.

For Firefly, the future vision is for creators to be able to use everyday language and other inputs to quickly be able to test out design variations, remove distractions from photos, add elements to an illustration, change the mood of a video, add texture to 3D objects, create digital experiences, and more ‚Äî then seamlessly customize and edit their content using a combination of Firefly and other Creative Cloud tools.

How do AI art generators work?

As a type of generative AI technology, AI art generators work similarly to other types of artificial intelligence, which use a machine learning model and large datasets to be able to produce a specific type of result. With generative AI, anybody can use everyday language and other inputs to produce images, videos, documents, digital experiences, and more. Adobe Firefly will be built into Creative Cloud to give people the tools to both generate results quickly and customize them to fit their unique vision.

How can I try out Generative Fill?

Download the Photoshop (beta) app to experiment with Generative Fill in Photoshop. The beta featuring Generative FIll is available to users with a Creative Cloud individual, teams, or enterprise license. Visit this page for information on how to try it today

What is Adobe doing to ensure AI-generated images are created responsibly?

With the Content Authenticity Initiative (CAI), Adobe is setting the industry standard for responsible generative AI. With more than 900 members today, the CAI is leading the conversation around digital content attribution. The CAI offers free, publicly available open source tools and is working on a widely adopted technical standard in collaboration with leading technology organizations through the nonprofit Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity (C2PA).

Firefly will automatically attach a tag in the embedded Content Credentials to make AI-generated art and content easily distinguishable from work created without generative AI.

Where does Firefly get its data from?

The current Firefly generative AI model is trained on a dataset of Adobe Stock, along with openly licensed work and public domain content where copyright has expired.

### Video Transcription


- [00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-1MWFoM2fY&t=5) initially on image and text effect generation.&nbsp; Firefly will offer new ways to ideate, invent,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-1MWFoM2fY&t=11) and communicate while significantly improving&nbsp; artistic workflows. Firefly is the natural&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-1MWFoM2fY&t=16) extension of the technology Adobe has produced&nbsp; over the past 40 years, driven by the belief that&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-1MWFoM2fY&t=22) people should be empowered to bring their ideas&nbsp; into the world precisely as they imagine them.&nbsp;

- [00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-1MWFoM2fY&t=27) Generative AI is a type of artificial intelligence&nbsp; that can translate ordinary words and other inputs&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-1MWFoM2fY&t=33) into extraordinary results. While the conversation&nbsp; around this technology has centered on AI image&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-1MWFoM2fY&t=39) and art generation, generative AI can do&nbsp; much more than generate static images from&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-1MWFoM2fY&t=44) text prompts. With a few simple words and the&nbsp; right AI generator, anyone can compose videos,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-1MWFoM2fY&t=49) documents, and digital experiences, as well&nbsp; as rich images and art. AI art generators can&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-1MWFoM2fY&t=55) also be useful for producing ‚Äúvisionary&nbsp; building blocks‚Äù like brushes, vectors,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-1MWFoM2fY&t=60) and textures that can add to or form&nbsp; the foundation of pieces of content.
