### Video Transcription


- [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=504f8S4MLTw&t=0) Greetings everyone. Today, I am going to introduce&nbsp; you to the most advanced state-of-the-art audio&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=504f8S4MLTw&t=6) generation model, MMAudio. So what does this&nbsp; model do is, it is able to generate audio&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=504f8S4MLTw&t=13) according to the input video, and also&nbsp; it is able to generate audio from text,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=504f8S4MLTw&t=17) and also it is able to generate from input image.&nbsp; So let me show you some of the examples and let's&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=504f8S4MLTw&t=23) begin this tutorial. As you have seen, I have&nbsp; uploaded this video and I have entered a prompt,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=504f8S4MLTw&t=34) and according to the video content and the&nbsp; prompt, it has generated this video. I will&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=504f8S4MLTw&t=39) show you how to write good prompts. Let's&nbsp; see several other examples. This is second&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=504f8S4MLTw&t=45) example. This is another amazing AI generated&nbsp; video and let's see the audio it generated.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=504f8S4MLTw&t=61) As you can see, the audio is perfectly matching&nbsp; to the input video and it is just mind-blowing.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=504f8S4MLTw&t=67) It is even better with the more realistic videos.&nbsp; Let's see how it generates. So the audio of this&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=504f8S4MLTw&t=77) video was generated with the MMAudio. Let me&nbsp; show you another example. Just purely amazing.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=504f8S4MLTw&t=91) And let's see an example of image upload and audio&nbsp; generation for that image. Just purely amazing.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=504f8S4MLTw&t=102) Finally, it is also able to generate audio from&nbsp; just text prompts. Let's see an example. Just&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=504f8S4MLTw&t=114) amazing. You see this is the prompt and this&nbsp; was the generation. Let's see another example.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=504f8S4MLTw&t=126) Just purely amazing. With a simple prompt&nbsp; and amazing output. So in this tutorial,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=504f8S4MLTw&t=131) I will show you how to install and run this&nbsp; application locally on your Windows computer&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=504f8S4MLTw&t=137) with full speed mode and also VRAM optimized&nbsp; mode. Moreover, I will show on Massed Compute,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=504f8S4MLTw&t=144) my favorite most affordable cloud platform. On&nbsp; Runpod, which is favorite of a lot of people,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=504f8S4MLTw&t=151) and on a free Kaggle account who is GPU poor and&nbsp; also doesn't want to pay any money to any cloud&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=504f8S4MLTw&t=156) services. The application I have developed is&nbsp; extremely advanced. I will show every feature of&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=504f8S4MLTw&t=162) it. So watch the Windows tutorial part, then you&nbsp; can run it either locally or on a cloud service&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=504f8S4MLTw&t=167) that you would like. So as usual, I have prepared&nbsp; an amazing instruction post. The link of this post&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=504f8S4MLTw&t=173) will be in the description of the video in below.&nbsp; So check it out. Once you entered to this post,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=504f8S4MLTw&t=179) you will see the latest installer zip file.&nbsp; I recommend you to read this post from top to&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=504f8S4MLTw&t=184) bottom. So click the latest zip file to download&nbsp; it. Before starting installation, make sure that&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=504f8S4MLTw&t=190) you have the requirements. These requirements&nbsp; are one-time follow. When you follow it, you will&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=504f8S4MLTw&t=195) be able to use all of the AI applications that I&nbsp; show you, that I teach you, that I share. So this&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=504f8S4MLTw&t=202) is one-time mandatory to follow. Once you have&nbsp; followed the requirements, move the downloaded&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=504f8S4MLTw&t=208) zip file into any disk that you want to install.&nbsp; Let's install it into my E drive and extract. Do&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=504f8S4MLTw&t=214) not install it into a shared drive like OneDrive,&nbsp; like Google Drive. So install it into your one of&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=504f8S4MLTw&t=221) the internal drive. Then double click Windows&nbsp; install.bat file, more info, run anyway. Do not&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=504f8S4MLTw&t=227) run anything as administrator. Always use double&nbsp; click or select and hit enter. This will download&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=504f8S4MLTw&t=234) and install everything automatically for you.&nbsp; Just wait for installation to be complete. This&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=504f8S4MLTw&t=240) Gradio application that I have developed working&nbsp; on RTX 5000 series as well, as well as with the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=504f8S4MLTw&t=246) older GPUs like RTX 4000 series, 3000 series,&nbsp; probably 2000, 1000 series. I haven't tested,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=504f8S4MLTw&t=253) but it should work. But it is working beginning&nbsp; from 3000 to above and it should work with the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=504f8S4MLTw&t=258) 2000 and older GPUs as well. When you see that&nbsp; virtual environment made and installed properly,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=504f8S4MLTw&t=264) the installation has been completed. Scroll up&nbsp; and see if there are any errors or not. If you&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=504f8S4MLTw&t=269) see any errors, select all of the logs,&nbsp; copy into a text file and just email me,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=504f8S4MLTw&t=275) message me from Patreon or from Discord. So I can&nbsp; see your error. So just click anything and it will&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=504f8S4MLTw&t=281) close. Once installed, you are ready to run it. So&nbsp; double click Windows start App.bat file, more info,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=504f8S4MLTw&t=288) run anyway and it will start the application.&nbsp; So if you have above 8 GB GPUs, select option&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=504f8S4MLTw&t=293) one. If you have below 8 GB GPUs, select option&nbsp; two. According to your GPU, select it. Wait for&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=504f8S4MLTw&t=299) application to start. Initially, it will download&nbsp; the models, then it will start the application.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=504f8S4MLTw&t=303) You see it is downloading the missing models right&nbsp; now. They will be all downloaded into this folder.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=504f8S4MLTw&t=309) This is one time only download, so it will not&nbsp; download again once they are downloaded. Okay,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=504f8S4MLTw&t=314) so the application has been started and&nbsp; this is our interface. First of all,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=504f8S4MLTw&t=319) it will generate the default configuration and&nbsp; load it, but you can always save your configs&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=504f8S4MLTw&t=324) and load them. It has 3 options, video to&nbsp; audio, text to audio and image to audio. So&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=504f8S4MLTw&t=330) let's begin with video to audio. Click here and&nbsp; select your input video. You can use any video,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=504f8S4MLTw&t=337) the videos that has already sound, it doesn't&nbsp; matter. So let's try this video for example.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=504f8S4MLTw&t=342) Let me play it. There is no sound. This is&nbsp; downloaded from CivitAI. So how you should&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=504f8S4MLTw&t=347) prompt this to generate? First of all, you don't&nbsp; need to prompt. It can already generate according&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=504f8S4MLTw&t=353) to the video. Let's try. Submit. You can see the&nbsp; status on the started CMD window always. This is&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=504f8S4MLTw&t=359) running on RTX 5090 right now. It is already very&nbsp; fast. As you see, it is showing the speed and&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=504f8S4MLTw&t=365) everything and it is generated. So you can click&nbsp; here to play it and it will start playing. Okay,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=504f8S4MLTw&t=375) so this is the audio it generated for this video&nbsp; without any prompt. So how you should prompt it? I&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=504f8S4MLTw&t=381) really recommend to use Google AI Studio. This is&nbsp; an amazing free to use AI right now. So select the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=504f8S4MLTw&t=389) Flash thinking experimental model. I like this and&nbsp; click plus icon, upload file. You can use this for&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=504f8S4MLTw&t=396) free and upload your video. Then you can use this&nbsp; prompt that I have prepared it for you. Paste it,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=504f8S4MLTw&t=402) wait for upload to be completed. You see, it is&nbsp; currently extracting the video. If your video&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=504f8S4MLTw&t=407) be too big, it may fail and it is uploaded. It&nbsp; is only using 1,300 tokens and run. Then this&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=504f8S4MLTw&t=414) will give us a very good prompt to generate audio&nbsp; for our models and it has given us this prompt.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=504f8S4MLTw&t=421) So let's copy this prompt. Let's copy and paste&nbsp; it here. Now you can generate multiple videos at&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=504f8S4MLTw&t=427) once. How you can do that? You see we have number&nbsp; of generations. Let's generate 10 videos. So it&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=504f8S4MLTw&t=433) will use different seeds and generate 10 audios&nbsp; for this video. You can also change number of&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=504f8S4MLTw&t=439) steps from here. Recommended is 25, but since it&nbsp; is really fast, I use 50. It will set it according&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=504f8S4MLTw&t=446) to your input video duration and you can also&nbsp; change the guidance strength. It will impact how&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=504f8S4MLTw&t=452) much prompt should be followed or not. Moreover,&nbsp; when you enable save generation parameters,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=504f8S4MLTw&t=458) it will save all the used parameters. I will show&nbsp; you. So let's hit submit and the generation has&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=504f8S4MLTw&t=464) been started. You see it is truncating video to&nbsp; generate accordingly and you will see the progress&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=504f8S4MLTw&t=471) like this. I have spent a lot of time to make&nbsp; this application perfect. It shows the step speed,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=504f8S4MLTw&t=476) it shows the generation status, the generation&nbsp; speed, the time it is going to take. So currently&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=504f8S4MLTw&t=483) it is generating 10 videos and it is taking around&nbsp; one minute to generate 10 different audios for&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=504f8S4MLTw&t=488) this input video. By the way, this is not the&nbsp; maximum speed because currently I am recording,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=504f8S4MLTw&t=493) but it is really really fast and it is also&nbsp; fast on RTX 3090 Ti as well. I will make a&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=504f8S4MLTw&t=498) comparison to show you. And the 10 videos has been&nbsp; generated. You can see all of them is displayed in&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=504f8S4MLTw&t=504) here. So you can click like this, then you can&nbsp; select videos to play them. Let me show you.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=504f8S4MLTw&t=523) So you can generate more audios until you find&nbsp; whatever you like most. This is so simple. Every&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=504f8S4MLTw&t=530) generation will be saved inside outputs folder.&nbsp; Click this open outputs folder and you see this is&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=504f8S4MLTw&t=536) where I have installed and it is inside outputs&nbsp; folder like this. So let's see the videos. So&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=504f8S4MLTw&t=542) these are the videos, the audios we have generated&nbsp; and when you open the params, it will show you all&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=504f8S4MLTw&t=548) of the used parameters like this, prompt, negative&nbsp; prompt, used seed, number of steps and whatever&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=504f8S4MLTw&t=553) there are. We also have batch processing&nbsp; feature. The batch processing is so simple,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=504f8S4MLTw&t=558) let me demonstrate you. So put the videos into a&nbsp; folder like this. You can define a separate prompt&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=504f8S4MLTw&t=565) for every video or you can just use the prompt&nbsp; written here. It is up to you. So how you can&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=504f8S4MLTw&t=571) define a prompt for each one? Generate a text&nbsp; file like this 1. This will be matching with&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=504f8S4MLTw&t=577) the first video and type a prompt like test 1.&nbsp; Then generate another text prompt for the second&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=504f8S4MLTw&t=583) video like 2 and this will be matching with the&nbsp; second video and let's not generate any prompt for&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=504f8S4MLTw&t=589) the third one and let's make this is the third&nbsp; video like this and it should use it. Then enter&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=504f8S4MLTw&t=594) your input folder like this and enter your output&nbsp; folder. Let's say B audio. And then click start&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=504f8S4MLTw&t=601) processing. You can also skip if existing and you&nbsp; can save generation parameters. Then follow what&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=504f8S4MLTw&t=607) is happening in the CMD window, but you need to&nbsp; be careful with something. When you have number&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=504f8S4MLTw&t=612) of generations here, it will still apply to&nbsp; your batch processing. So it is currently going&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=504f8S4MLTw&t=619) to generate 10 videos for every video. So let's&nbsp; open our target desired folder, which is inside&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=504f8S4MLTw&t=626) here and we can see that it is batch processing&nbsp; every video. Let's open the parameters. So we can&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=504f8S4MLTw&t=631) see it is using test 1. This is amazing. And&nbsp; the second video will be also test 1. However,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=504f8S4MLTw&t=636) it is using different seeds. So this is how batch&nbsp; processing works. This is the logic of it. Let's&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=504f8S4MLTw&t=641) cancel the batch processing. The batch processing&nbsp; should be canceled. Then let's make the number of&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=504f8S4MLTw&t=646) generations 1 and I will start batch processing&nbsp; again. Now it should start generating one time&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=504f8S4MLTw&t=652) for every video and you can watch the progress&nbsp; here. By the way, the batch processing will be&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=504f8S4MLTw&t=658) canceled once these 10 videos are done. So always&nbsp; pay attention to the number of generations. And&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=504f8S4MLTw&t=664) currently it is really slow because I am using a&nbsp; lot of VRAM with the other applications. So let&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=504f8S4MLTw&t=668) me close everything and restart. So what about&nbsp; text to audio? For text to audio, click here. It&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=504f8S4MLTw&t=673) is just taking prompts to generate audio files.&nbsp; I already have two examples here. For example,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=504f8S4MLTw&t=680) this one, just type it. How many you want to&nbsp; generate the same settings? Let's generate 3

- [00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=504f8S4MLTw&t=685) and click submit. It will generate 3 audio&nbsp; files with this prompt. You can always monitor&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=504f8S4MLTw&t=691) what is happening on CMD, remember that. You&nbsp; see I did restart and closed some of the other&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=504f8S4MLTw&t=695) applications and now it is faster. Let's play some&nbsp; of them. Yeah, it is really great. You can click&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=504f8S4MLTw&t=706) here and download or you can open outputs folder&nbsp; and you will see they are generated like this,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=504f8S4MLTw&t=712) 12 MP3, 13 MP3 or 14 MP3. This is also supporting&nbsp; batch processing. For batch processing, you need&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=504f8S4MLTw&t=719) to type prompts here. So let's copy these two and&nbsp; type here. You can also set an output folder for&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=504f8S4MLTw&t=726) the batch processing of the text to audio. Let's&nbsp; generate them inside here and let's say 3 and&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=504f8S4MLTw&t=732) start batch processing. It will skip if the line&nbsp; is empty or lesser than 2 characters. So don't&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=504f8S4MLTw&t=738) worry about that and now it is generating. We&nbsp; will see the results. Yes, it is completed.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=504f8S4MLTw&t=744) Let's open the folder inside here. Oh, by the&nbsp; way, still it is generating number of 3. So&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=504f8S4MLTw&t=750) I am always forgetting that, don't forget that.&nbsp; I can see that it is generating. You can also&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=504f8S4MLTw&t=755) see the used parameters, the prompt, the negative&nbsp; prompt, used seed and everything and it is already&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=504f8S4MLTw&t=761) done. It is super fast. This application is just&nbsp; super fast. Just double click and play. Okay,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=504f8S4MLTw&t=770) it is working as expected. So what about image to&nbsp; audio? Image to audio generates audio according to&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=504f8S4MLTw&t=777) the image. Let's upload an image for testing. For&nbsp; example, this image. Now you don't need to type&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=504f8S4MLTw&t=782) any prompt. Let's first try that way. Submit. The&nbsp; speed doesn't really change and it is generated.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=504f8S4MLTw&t=788) Let's play it. Okay, not very relative to the&nbsp; image. So we need to support it with a prompt,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=504f8S4MLTw&t=799) but sometimes it works. For example, let's try&nbsp; another one before I show you. For example,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=504f8S4MLTw&t=803) let's try this one. Submit. Okay, let's play.&nbsp; Yes, this one definitely more matching. So how&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=504f8S4MLTw&t=811) you can decide your prompt? Again, you can use&nbsp; this prompt on here. So let's clear this chat&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=504f8S4MLTw&t=817) and let's upload our image and see what it is&nbsp; giving to us. Okay, let's try this image. Wait&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=504f8S4MLTw&t=823) for upload to be completed and run. Okay, it gave&nbsp; us a prompt. So let's try copy it and paste it and&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=504f8S4MLTw&t=832) let's see. Let's play it. Okay, it is decent. You&nbsp; can always generate multiple and decide which one&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=504f8S4MLTw&t=842) is best. Image to audio is also supporting batch&nbsp; and the logic is exactly same as in the video&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=504f8S4MLTw&t=849) batch. So let me demonstrate you. Put the images&nbsp; into a folder and type prompts if you wish like&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=504f8S4MLTw&t=855) try like this one, let's say a dragon. You don't&nbsp; need to necessarily define and the same logic,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=504f8S4MLTw&t=862) let's say like this and let's see. Then start&nbsp; batch processing. It will process all the images&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=504f8S4MLTw&t=868) and generate audio and generate a video. The video&nbsp; will be static of course. Let's return back to&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=504f8S4MLTw&t=873) the folder and the files are generated like this.&nbsp; Let's play. As you can see, it is pretty cool. So&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=504f8S4MLTw&t=885) this is how you can do batch processing with image&nbsp; to audio. What about configuration? Let's say you&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=504f8S4MLTw&t=890) want to change configurations, for example,&nbsp; the duration for text to audio. For example,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=504f8S4MLTw&t=896) like this 10. Let's say you want to change image&nbsp; to audio number of steps like 100. Then you need&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=504f8S4MLTw&t=901) to go to here and set a config like test 1,&nbsp; save config and now it is selected and it is&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=504f8S4MLTw&t=908) set. So if you want to return back to the default,&nbsp; select the default and load config and it will be&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=504f8S4MLTw&t=914) default. If you want to get the default again, it&nbsp; is so easy. Go to the MMaudio, go to the folder&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=504f8S4MLTw&t=921) and you will see that there are configs folder.&nbsp; Just delete it and restart your application and it&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=504f8S4MLTw&t=925) will regenerate the default configuration. So now&nbsp; I will show speed comparison between RTX 5090 and&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=504f8S4MLTw&t=933) RTX 3090 Ti. I have both of the GPUs, so let me&nbsp; demonstrate you the speed comparison. Since when&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=504f8S4MLTw&t=939) recording a video, it takes a lot of GPU power, I&nbsp; will stop recording and I will make a comparison,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=504f8S4MLTw&t=946) but before stopping and making that comparison,&nbsp; let's make a live comparison. So I will copy paste&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=504f8S4MLTw&t=952) this to set GPU IDs. The first one will start&nbsp; on my first GPU. The second one, I will right&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=504f8S4MLTw&t=958) click and edit in Notepad++. And I will set CUDA&nbsp; visible devices 1. So it will use my second GPU.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=504f8S4MLTw&t=965) Let's start it and again the first option. We can&nbsp; see that it will load the models here. Okay, both&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=504f8S4MLTw&t=971) of the applications started on each of the GPU.&nbsp; So let's start a comparison. So let's try this&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=504f8S4MLTw&t=977) video on both of them. Upload. Let's get to our&nbsp; prompt. I will get the prompt from here since it&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=504f8S4MLTw&t=984) is saved. For example, this one. Type the prompt&nbsp; in both of the audio panel and let's generate 10&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=504f8S4MLTw&t=991) audio to see the speed difference. Okay, 10. Now&nbsp; we can see both of the applications will start&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=504f8S4MLTw&t=998) generation and we can see the speed comparison.&nbsp; So currently average of the 5090 Ti is 7 seconds.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=504f8S4MLTw&t=1007) 3090 Ti is like 9 seconds. This application is not&nbsp; able to fully utilize the GPU because it has other&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=504f8S4MLTw&t=1014) parts that uses the CPU, but it is really really&nbsp; fast when we consider the amount of the VRAM it&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=504f8S4MLTw&t=1022) uses and the time it takes to generate such audio&nbsp; with such amount of steps. I am using 50 steps,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=504f8S4MLTw&t=1029) but you can use 25 steps as well. So this is&nbsp; the live comparison. Now I will close the video&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=504f8S4MLTw&t=1035) recording, make a more fair comparison and show&nbsp; you the results. So I have made the generations&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=504f8S4MLTw&t=1041) and calculated the average. The average speed of&nbsp; the RTX 5090 is 16.5 IT second and the average&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=504f8S4MLTw&t=1050) of 3090 Ti is 13.61 IT second. If we calculate&nbsp; the difference, 16.5 over 13.61, it is around&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=504f8S4MLTw&t=1060) 20% faster for this application, but in some other&nbsp; applications we get 300% speed difference. On this&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=504f8S4MLTw&t=1068) application, there is not much difference. Now&nbsp; I will show you how you can use this application&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=504f8S4MLTw&t=1073) on cloud services. The using on cloud services&nbsp; is so easy. First of all, I will show on Massed&nbsp;&nbsp;
