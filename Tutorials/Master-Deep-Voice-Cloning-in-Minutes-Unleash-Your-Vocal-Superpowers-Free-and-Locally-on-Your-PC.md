- [00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=76) Are you wondering why this tutorial stands out from the rest?

- [00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=80) It is because with a simple drag and drop, your speech file can be transformed into your

- [00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=85) complete training data.

- [00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=86) Thanks to our chosen user friendly graphical user interface, you can set up all training

- [00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=92) parameters and launch your training with just a single click.

- [00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=96) Once the training is complete, my specially developed scripts will enable you to convert

- [00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=101) an entire text file into speech, again, just by dragging and dropping.

- [00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=106) What is more, each step is clearly documented and demonstrated in this tutorial video, making

- [00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=112) it incredibly easy for you to follow along.

- [00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=116) This tutorial offers a seamless and convenient process unlike any other.

- [00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=121) So are you ready to jump into the world of voice cloning?

- [00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=125) Let's get started.

- [00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=127) So there will be three parts of this tutorial.

- [00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=130) From now on, I will use our new GitHub repository to add these commands and other links instead

- [00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=137) of using Gist.

- [00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=139) The link of this file will be in the description and everything you need will be in this file.

- [00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=144) You see it is neatly organized.

- [00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=146) It is also much better looking.

- [00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=149) If you also start our repository and watch our repository, I would appreciate that very

- [00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=154) much.

- [00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=155) The first step is preparing training speech files.

- [00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=158) To do that, first you need to accept the license terms of this link.

- [00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=163) This is a segmentation model.

- [00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=165) Hugging Face requires to accept their license to use this.

- [00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=169) Currently, I am logged into my account.

- [00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=171) You can register for free to use Hugging Face.

- [00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=174) Then we will begin with cloning this repository.

- [00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=177) This is an open source tool that will allow us to preprocess the speech files.

- [00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=182) This is making our job very, very easy.

- [00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=185) Preprocessing of audio files is really hard and extremely important.

- [00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=190) So I will clone it into this directory, git clone, then we need to install it.

- [00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=196) For installation, you need to have Anaconda or Miniconda.

- [00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=199) The links are in here.

- [00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=201) Also, I have shown how to install in this tutorial.

- [00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=204) So when I type Ana, it displays me Anaconda prompt like this.

- [00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=209) That means that it is installed.

- [00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=211) Once you installed Anaconda or Miniconda, enter inside the Ozen Toolkit directory and

- [00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=217) double click set up Ozen.bat file.

- [00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=219) You see it says that it found Anaconda.

- [00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=221) However, since there is already virtual environment with the Ozen name, I have to delete it to

- [00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=227) reinstall.

- [00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=228) Now I will do that.

- [00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=230) So I will enter inside this folder and my Anaconda virtual environments are here.

- [00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=235) I will delete both of them.

- [00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=237) Okay the folders are deleted.

- [00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=238) Now I will run again the setup: Ozen.bat file.

- [00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=242) Okay.

- [00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=243) It says that it has found Anaconda.

- [00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=245) It made the Ozen virtual environment directory, and now it will collect all the packages and

- [00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=252) install them.

- [00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=253) This will take a while.

- [00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=254) So be patient.

- [00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=255) After a while, you will see that it is installing all the necessary libraries like this.

- [00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=260) Okay.

- [00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=261) The installation has been completed.

- [00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=263) Now I will show you what kind of output you are expecting.

- [00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=268) It will show all of the packages collected, installed like this.

- [00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=272) There isn't any error.

- [00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=274) Okay.

- [00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=275) In the bottom, you will see attempting to uninstall, found installation, installing.

- [00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=279) And in the very bottom, you should see a message like this.

- [00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=283) And in the end, it says that it is done.

- [00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=287) So hit the key to continue.

- [00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=289) Once the installation has been completed, now we are ready to preprocess our training

- [00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=294) data.

- [00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=296) So for preprocessing, all we need to do is drag and drop our speech file into here.

- [00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=301) However, there are some key issues.

- [00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=304) I will right click Ozen.py and I will edit it with Notepad++.

- [00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=309) So in this file, there are several settings that you may want to change.

- [00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=314) It will use Whisper for transcribing.

- [00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=316) I already have amazing Whisper tutorial on my channel if you are interested in it.

- [00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=322) I also put the link of that into this file.

- [00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=325) Whisper tutorial.

- [00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=326) So what about Whisper?

- [00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=328) It is by default using large version 2, which requires about 10 to 11 GB VRAM.

- [00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=334) If you don't have such graphic card, what can you do?

- [00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=337) You can use the other models written here.

- [00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=340) For example, medium.en, it will use about 5 GB VRAM memory, copy it.

- [00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=346) And for changing it, you need to just change the last part of it like this.

- [00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=351) And it will work.

- [00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=352) There is a trade-off that you need to make.

- [00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=355) If you don't have sufficient amount of VRAM memory, the transcribing quality will be lower.

- [00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=360) I will use a large model since I have RTX 3090.

- [00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=364) And there are also other settings.

- [00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=366) I am not changing any of the other settings because they are working.

- [00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=370) By the way, also, make sure to change the value in here as well.

- [00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=374) You can be ensured that both here and here are same for Whisper.

- [00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=379) However, there is one another option which will be much more slower.

- [00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=382) If you don't want to use medium model, you can change this default CUDA to CPU.

- [00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=388) When you do this, it will use CPU for transcribing.

- [00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=394) It will be significantly slower, but large model will also work on lower VRAM graphic

- [00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=400) cards.

- [00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=401) However, I would prefer medium model if I were you.

- [00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=405) Okay, as a next, I will move my speech file into here.

- [00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=408) Then all you need to do is drag and drop it into this CMD window like this.

- [00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=414) It will open a new CMD window and it will start processing files.

- [00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=420) Since we didn't set our Hugging Face token, we need to set it in here.

- [00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=425) To get your Hugging Face token, you can directly open this link.

- [00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=429) You need to have a free Hugging Face account.

- [00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=431) Then click New Token.

- [00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=434) Type anything you want.

- [00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=435) Generate Token.

- [00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=436) Copy Token.

- [00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=437) Right click and paste it here.

- [00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=439) Hit Enter.

- [00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=440) And it will start pre-processing your speech data.

- [00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=443) If your speech data is not a single file, what can you do?

- [00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=448) You can merge all of them into a single file.

- [00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=450) To merge multiple audio files into a single file you can use this ffmpeg -i command I

- [00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=458) have written here.

- [00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=459) You just need to give the file names inside a given folder.

- [00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=463) You will also get some warnings like this.

- [00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=466) You can ignore them.

- [00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=468) It will quite take a while in this screen.

- [00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=470) You won't see anything.

- [00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=472) However, you see, my CPU usage is 100% because the script is currently finding the speech-less

- [00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=481) parts in the given speech file.

- [00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=483) And then splitting the speech into small parts because the training depends on small speech

- [00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=491) files.

- [00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=492) Okay, after the script processed file, it started to whisper.

- [00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=495) However, I have an error because apparently the script owner didn't fix its Torch version

- [00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=502) installation.

- [00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=503) So what we are going to do is we will install Torch ourselves with CUDA enabled.

- [00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=509) To do that, first you need to activate this Ozen virtual environment.

- [00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=514) How to do that?

- [00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=516) Type anaconda.

- [00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=517) You will see this.

- [00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=518) Open it.

- [00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=519) Then type conda activate the virtual environment name like this.

- [00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=525) Okay, apparently since I also have mini conda, I need to open mini conda.

- [00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=530) So I will open mini conda 3.

- [00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=532) And now mini conda started.

- [00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=534) I am not deleting these parts because you may also encounter problems and this is how

- [00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=540) you are going to solve your problems.

- [00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=542) So type conda activate Ozen.

- [00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=545) Then we will do pip uninstall Torch.

- [00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=548) Okay, apparently 1.13 was installed.

- [00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=551) I will uninstall it.

- [00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=553) Then you need to execute this command.

- [00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=555) It will install Torch version 1.13 with CUDA support like this.

- [00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=560) Okay, new Torch installation has been completed.

- [00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=563) There is no error.

- [00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=565) Closing it.

- [00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=566) Then I will close this screen too.

- [00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=568) Then I will drag and drop the generated WAV file like this.

- [00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=572) It will start processing again.

- [00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=574) Each time when you preprocess a speech file, it will generate folders inside output folder.

- [00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=581) You see this is the previous one we made with the name of trainingspeech.mp3.

- [00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=585) When I open it, you will see WAVs folder here, train and valid txt here.

- [00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=592) These txt files will be written with the whisper transcription.

- [00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=595) Since the last time failed, they are empty.

- [00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=598) However, we can see the segmented WAV files here correctly.

- [00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=603) And now it is doing the segmentation once again.

- [00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=606) Okay, it is segmented.

- [00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=608) So it will start processing whisper with transcribing.

- [00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=611) Yes, we are seeing the whisper transcribing.

- [00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=615) While transcribing, you can open the text files and you will see the WAV files with

- [00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=619) their name and the transcription of them like this.

- [00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=624) The speech file will be split into small parts ss I said.

- [00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=627) When I click more, I will show you their duration.

- [00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=631) So I pick duration here.

- [00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=633) Okay, duration isn't empty.

- [00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=635) Let's add another sort option.

- [00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=638) Okay, the length is working.

- [00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=640) So these are the durations of the split files.

- [00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=644) Maximum duration is about 23 seconds.

- [00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=648) Let me open one of them to show you.

- [00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=651) It is exactly this problem which I am wrestling with at present in the basement of the house.

- [00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=655) So this is the 30 numbered file.

- [00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=658) Let's see, it's transcribing.

- [00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=659) Okay, here it's transcription.

- [00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=662) It is exactly this problem which I am wrestling with at present in the basement of the house.

- [00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=668) So let's listen again.

- [00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=669) It is exactly this problem which I am wrestling with at present in the basement of the house.

- [00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=673) As you see, it is correct.

- [00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=675) You will see the process here.

- [00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=677) It has segmented our entire speech file into 691 segments and then it will transcribe each

- [00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=685) one of them and add them into the text file.

- [00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=688) Without this repository, this would be a huge task to preprocess them.

- [00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=694) However, thanks to Ozen Public Library, it is done really fast with easiness.

- [00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=701) The transcribing of all of the files have been completed.

- [00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=706) Now before moving to the next part, there is a very important thing that I had to do

- [00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=712) a lot of research to find out.: Go to your output.

- [00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=715) Go to your folder.

- [00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=717) Open train.txt file.

- [00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=720) Select all with Ctrl A then Ctrl C copy.

- [00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=724) Then go to encoding.

- [00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=726) Make it UTF-8.

- [00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=728) I am using Notepad++ by the way.

- [00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=730) Then you may notice some of the characters are displayed like this.

- [00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=735) These are errors because of the encoding.

- [00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=738) Then paste it and they will be fixed and save it.

- [00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=741) Then open the valid.txt file as well.

- [00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=744) Ctrl A. Ctrl C. Go to encoding.

- [00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=748) Make it UTF-8.

- [00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=750) Ctrl V. Save and close.

- [00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=752) If you don't do this, then you will likely to encounter errors in the next part.

- [00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=758) So now we have our WAV files.

- [00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=760) We have our train and valid.txt files and we are ready.

- [00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=764) As the second part, we will install DL Art School for training.

- [00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=770) DL Art School is a fork of this one.

- [00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=774) So to install it, we will begin with doing a git clone.

- [00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=778) I open my folder.

- [00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=780) Open a new cmd.

- [00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=782) Clone it inside there.

- [00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=784) It is cloned.

- [00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=785) Then enter inside the folder and run setup DLAS.bat file like this.

- [00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=792) You see it has found Anaconda.

- [00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=795) It is generating DLAS virtual environment inside my miniconda installation.

- [00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=800) This will also take a while, so be patient.

- [00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=803) The installation has been completed.

- [00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=806) Now I will show you the messages that I have got.

- [00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=809) So in the end, you will see messages like this.

- [00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=812) Installation messages.

- [00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=813) Successfully installed.

- [00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=815) And then it will download autoregressive model.

- [00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=818) It may take a while depending on your download speed.

- [00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=821) And finally, all of the installations are completed.

- [00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=825) Press any key to continue.

- [00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=826) Then we are ready to start our training.

- [00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=829) To do that, click start DLAS.cmd file.

- [00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=833) And it will start this very nice graphical user interface for us.

- [00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=837) First, decide your project name.

- [00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=840) The files will be saved inside named as your project name folder.

- [00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=846) So let's say voiceclone like this.

- [00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=849) GPU IDs you can define.

- [00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=851) I will use my first GPU.

- [00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=853) You don't need to change any of these variables.

- [00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=856) Okay, the first very important thing is setting our data set path.

- [00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=861) Click three dots icon here.

- [00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=864) Got your ozen-toolkit directory.

- [00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=867) Inside here output.

- [00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=868) And this is my final training data set.

- [00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=871) I am picking the main folder like this.

- [00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=874) Not the WAVs files.

- [00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=877) Select folder.

- [00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=878) If you select incorrect folder, it will give you an error.

- [00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=881) Let me show you.

- [00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=882) For example, let's select here.

- [00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=883) You see data set folder is not valid.

- [00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=886) So you need to pick a valid data set folder like this.

- [00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=890) Then these variables what you should set.

- [00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=893) This is hard to decide actually.

- [00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=895) So as you increase your train batch size, it will be faster training because at each

- [00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=901) step it will train multiple files at the same time.

- [00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=906) However, it will also increase your VRAM usage.

- [00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=909) Since we need to do a lot of training, you should set both of these train batch size

- [00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=913) and validation batch size as much as possible.

- [00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=917) So you can try bigger values until you get out of memory error.

- [00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=922) I am clicking auto settings and it is setting some variables like this as you are seeing.

- [00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=927) Then there is one important thing.

- [00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=930) Logger settings.

- [00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=931) So we should save checkpoints.

- [00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=934) Because you may decide to interrupt your training.

- [00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=937) And if you don't save any checkpoint, then you won't have anything to use.

- [00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=943) If you also save states, it will save the state of the model training.

- [00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=947) But this will take a lot of space on your computer.

- [00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=950) So be careful.

- [00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=951) I will make print status 5, save checkpoints 5 and visual debug frequency 5.

- [00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=956) Then we are ready.

- [00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=958) We just need to click start training.

- [00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=961) After you click start training, you will see messages in your CMD window.

- [00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=965) Apparently, we have an error and it looks like Torch error.

- [00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=970) So now I will reinstall the Torch on the virtual environment of this repository.

- [00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=977) So first we will activate DLAS.

- [00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=980) I am copying this command, starting my mini conda, typing command activated the DLAS virtual

- [00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=987) environment.

- [00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=988) Then pip uninstall Torch like this.

- [00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=991) It has installed version 2.

- [00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=993) I will uninstall it.

- [00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=994) Then I will execute this command.

- [00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=996) This is the latest Torch version from PyTorque website.

- [00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1000) OK, the Torch installation has been completed.

- [00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1003) Let's restart.

- [00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1004) Double click start DLAS.cmd file.

- [00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1007) The user interface started.

- [00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1009) It will auto load all of the previous settings as you are seeing right now.

- [00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1013) Just click start training and the training is starting.

- [00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1016) It will display all of the parameters like this.

- [00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1020) Now I will explain number of steps, number of epochs and how it is working.

- [00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1026) You see it displays that number of training data elements is 552.

- [00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1032) This is automatically set and number of iterations is 4.

- [00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1036) So how did it come with these numbers?

- [00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1040) We did set our train batch size as 138.

- [00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1046) And we have 552 training sound files in the training data set.

- [00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1052) Therefore, with 4 steps it will be able to process 552 sound files.

- [00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1061) Because batch size is 138.

- [00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1063) And we did set number of maximum steps to 50,000.

- [00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1069) Therefore, it will do 50,000 steps training and with 4 step it will do 1 epoch.

- [00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1077) Which means it will do total 12,500 epochs.

- [00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1082) Just pause the video and read the description I have written in here and you will understand

- [00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1088) how the number of iterations, number of epochs, number of total steps are decided, calculated

- [00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1097) and printed on the screen.

- [00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1099) It took me a while to understand how it is working and you won't find this information

- [00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1105) anywhere else.

- [00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1106) You may get some warnings like this.

- [00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1108) You can ignore them.

- [00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1109) And finally, the training started.

- [00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1112) You see it is using autoregressive.pth file, which I said it was downloading.

- [00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1118) It is also located inside this folder under experiments.

- [00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1122) Okay, training is going on right now.

- [00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1125) It is using this much GPU.

- [00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1128) There are also other open applications such as video recording and other things.

- [00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1132) Therefore, this is probably higher than what it should be.

- [00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1136) As I said, if you reduce your batch size, it will use lesser VRAM.

- [00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1141) However, increasing your batch size to maximum possible batch size is better.

- [00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1146) Okay, the first epoch is completed and it has saved the files inside experiments inside

- [00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1154) my name which is voice clone.

- [00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1157) My project name inside models.

- [00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1159) You see this is 0_gpt.pth file.

- [00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1163) This is the file where our trained voice is.

- [00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1168) And since we are saving the states, the state file is also saved here.

- [00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1173) After the initial zero state, it will save after every five epochs.

- [00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1177) Why?

- [00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1178) Because it is the setting that we set.

- [00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1180) We set as save after every five epochs.

- [00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1184) So be careful with that because each file is like one gigabyte for state and for model

- [00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1191) checkpoints, it is like 1.6 gigabytes.

- [00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1195) So it will take a lot of space in your computer if you set it frequently saving checkpoints.

- [00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1200) Okay, we are over 40 epochs and we are ready to start generating our cloned voice.

- [00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1207) However, there are several important things that I want to explain you.

- [00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1212) As the training continue.

- [00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1214) You will notice that it displays epoch number, iteration count, and most importantly, loss

- [00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1221) values as you are seeing right now.

- [00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1223) So when the loss value staying same or gets increasing, that means that you have reached

- [00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1231) to the point where training is completed.

- [00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1235) Also in the upcoming part of the video, I will show how to compare different checkpoints.

- [00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1241) But this is important.

- [00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1242) We want to have as possibly as lower loss value and also do checkpoint comparison.

- [00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1250) And if you also carefully look with every epoch, you will see the loss value we are

- [00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1256) getting is decreasing.

- [00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1258) It starts with 2.97, then 2.92, then 2.89, then 2.85.

- [00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1268) The loss value is a term used in the machine learning.

- [00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1271) You can ask ChatGPT to learn more about this.

- [00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1275) Moreover, to display loss values as a graph, I prepared this script.

- [00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1281) The only part you need to change with this script is the this file path where the training

- [00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1289) log is located.

- [00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1291) Let me: run it and show you the results.

- [00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1293) I start a new CMD type Python and run the loss value.py and it will display this graph

- [00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1301) for me.

- [00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1302) You can save it.

- [00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1303) You can zoom it.

- [00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1304) For example, let's save the figure.

- [00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1307) Also from here you can make it bigger like this.

- [00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1309) This is really convenient to use and it will make your job and life easier to see how the

- [00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1316) loss values is getting decreased over time.

- [00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1320) This script will be also posted on our Patreon post, which I will explain in the upcoming

- [00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1326) chapter of the video.

- [00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1327) And also, it will be available in the GitHub file as well with the instruction how to use.

- [00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1333) OK, we have got 40 epoch checkpoint and now we are ready to start generating our cloned

- [00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1339) voice.

- [00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1340) However, there are several important things that I want to mention.

- [00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1344) First of all, if you have more training data and if they are higher quality, you will get

- [00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1350) better results.

- [00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1351) Moreover, your learning rate stepping would also matter, but I didn't test them, so I

- [00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1357) have used whatever the values the algorithm has given me with auto settings.

- [00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1362) So you can change this learning rate, learning rate stepping and other values here.

- [00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1367) Also, more training doesn't mean always better results.

- [00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1372) It may be over trained.

- [00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1374) Therefore, you should compare several checkpoints.

- [00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1377) If I were you, I wouldn't save these many checkpoints.

- [00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1381) Probably I would make save checkpoint frequency like 50 and then I would compare different

- [00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1388) checkpoints.

- [00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1389) I can't give you exact good values because I didn't have that much time to test every

- [00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1395) parameters, but these are the fundamentals.

- [00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1398) For part 3, generating cloned voice, we will use Tortoise TTS fast.

- [00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1404) Unfortunately, there is not a neaty UI for this, but I will provide a good .bat file

- [00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1411) that will make your life much easier.

- [00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1414) So we will begin with cloning the Tortoise TTS fast.

- [00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1418) Simply this repository.

- [00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1420) It is forked from the original Tortoise TTS.

- [00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1423) However, this repository is much faster than Tortoise TTS.

- [00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1428) So let's begin.

- [00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1429) I will clone it inside my same folder like this.

- [00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1433) After cloning done.

- [00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1435) We will make a new virtual environment because we don't want it to mess with our other installations.

- [00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1441) So enter inside Tortoise TTS folder or wherever you want to install the virtual environment.

- [00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1448) Open a new CMD type like this.

- [00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1451) I am using Python 3.10.9 version.

- [00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1454) So if you use Python 3.9 or if you use Python 3.11, it may not work.

- [00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1461) You should definitely use Python 3.10.x version, preferably the same version as me.

- [00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1468) Okay, virtual environment is generated.

- [00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1470) Now move into the virtual environment folder like this, or you can start new CMD inside

- [00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1476) there.

- [00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1477) Move to scripts, type activate.

- [00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1480) Now the new virtual environment is activated and we are ready to install the Tortoise TTS

- [00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1486) fast.

- [00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1487) So we will begin installation with Torch version 1.13.

- [00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1492) Just copy paste it.

- [00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1494) Be careful that you are in the activated virtual environment folder like this.

- [00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1499) Okay, torch installation is completed.

- [00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1501) Now as a next step, we need to move into the main installation folder.

- [00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1506) This one for me.

- [00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1508) So watch me cd.. and cd..

- [00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1512) And now I am in the main installation folder.

- [00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1515) And now I will run this installation command where while I am in the main folder and virtual

- [00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1522) environment is activated, hit enter.

- [00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1524) It will install every dependency inside your virtual environment folder.

- [00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1530) Okay, the installation has been completed.

- [00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1532) You may get some warning messages like this.

- [00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1535) You can ignore them.

- [00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1536) Now as a next step, we will install this one.

- [00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1539) Copy paste while virtual environment is activated.

- [00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1541) Okay, it has been also installed.

- [00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1545) Now we are ready to start using.

- [00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1547) There is a web UI in this repository.

- [00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1550) However, it is not working good, unfortunately.

- [00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1554) So we have to use command line interface.

- [00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1557) This is the base command that we will use.

- [00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1560) As I said, I will also share and show you a much better script.

- [00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1564) So let's begin with the simple command.

- [00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1567) Copy this.

- [00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1568) So this is the base command.

- [00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1569) But we need to do is we need to first give the checkpoint path here.

- [00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1574) My checkpoint is here.

- [00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1576) While hitting left shift key, I right click and copy as path.

- [00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1580) Then I paste it here.

- [00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1582) And then I need to give my prompt to generate voice.

- [00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1586) Let's generate such as welcome to the software engineering courses channel.

- [00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1591) There is also one more thing.

- [00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1593) You see you need to run this Python file inside script folder.

- [00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1598) So while virtual environment is activated, we need to move inside scripts folder like

- [00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1603) this.

- [00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1604) This is the folder where I need to run this command.

- [00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1607) So now I am ready.

- [00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1609) I will change this as Python and the command itself just copy pasted here.

- [00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1614) Okay, we are not in the correct folder.

- [00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1617) Let's check it out.

- [00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1618) You see there is a one single letter difference because their GitHub description is not up

- [00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1624) to date.

- [00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1625) The file name is not like this, but it is like this.

- [00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1628) So let's run it again.

- [00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1630) When generating a voice with Tortoise there is some important parameters.

- [00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1636) The most important one is the preset.

- [00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1639) So when we open this file, you will see all of the options it has.

- [00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1644) The preset it has ultra fast, fast, standard, high quality.

- [00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1650) So I tested standard and high quality.

- [00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1653) They really require a lot of VRAM.

- [00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1655) If you don't have such amount of VRAM, then you should use ultra fast preset.

- [00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1660) Fast is also working decent.

- [00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1662) Okay, since their repo is not up to date, there is no option as very fast.

- [00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1668) So we need to modify our command as preset fast and then run the command again and it

- [00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1676) will start.

- [00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1677) Okay, there is one more error.

- [00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1679) And the last error is the checkpoint.

- [00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1681) When we check out the file, we see that the checkpoint parameter is now like this.

- [00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1688) So this will be dash dash like this.

- [00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1691) Don't worry.

- [00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1692) I already put this into our GitHub file.

- [00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1696) So let's copy and run here.

- [00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1699) And it starts generating with our trained voice model.

- [00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1703) By the way, 40 epoch is very low.

- [00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1706) Therefore, the quality we are going to get will be probably pretty bad.

- [00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1711) Okay, the voice is generated.

- [00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1713) It only took 25 seconds as you are seeing here.

- [00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1716) The result will be saved inside scripts inside result folder and the random combined means

- [00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1724) that it combined all of the generated voices in one run.

- [00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1728) I will explain that.

- [00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1729) Don't worry.

- [00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1730) So let's run and see it.

- [00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1732) Welcome to the software engineering courses channel.

- [00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1735) So this is the voice we got.

- [00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1737) Let's also listen the original one.

- [00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1739) Okay, let's listen this one indeed.

- [00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1742) Yes, I'm trying to find out what's happening about luncheon.

- [00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1746) And let's also listen another original one.

- [00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1748) It is exactly this problem which I am wrestling with at present in the basement of the house.

- [00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1752) And let's listen our generated voice one more time.

- [00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1756) Welcome to the software engineering courses channel.

- [00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1759) Okay, this time I will use my pre trained model, which is at the 1480 epoch.

- [00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1766) So I will change this epoch file to this one and regenerate the voice.

- [00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1773) And let's compare the results.

- [00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1775) Okay, new file is generated.

- [00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1778) Let's listen it.

- [00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1779) Welcome to the software engineering courses channel.

- [00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1781) Now it is much better, but we can still improve it.

- [00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1785) How?

- [00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1786) We can improve it with standard quality.

- [00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1789) Let's test it.

- [00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1790) So instead of fast I will try standard.

- [00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1792) Okay, with standard quality, it took about one minute to generate.

- [00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1797) So let's listen it.

- [00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1799) Welcome to the software engineering courses channel.

- [00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1802) And this is the standard quality.

- [00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1804) There is one more parameter that we can use to improve quality, which is diffusion iterations.

- [00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1810) Let's also increase it.

- [00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1812) So to add that, what we need to do is --diffusion_iterations and let's set it as 500.

- [00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1819) And let's rerun.

- [00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1820) While it is running let me show you some of the other parameters here.

- [00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1824) There is low VRAM parameter.

- [00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1826) If you provide this as --low VRAM true, it will be enabled.

- [00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1832) There is also half parameters, half precision.

- [00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1835) All these will reduce your VRAM usage.

- [00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1839) Some of them may also reduce your speed such as low VRAM probably.

- [00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1844) The explanations are really, really good.

- [00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1846) So how did I open this file?

- [00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1848) This file is inside scripts and in here: Tortoise_TTS.py file.

- [00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1856) So you can read all of these parameters, see their description, and you can add them if

- [00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1861) you wish.

- [00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1863) So currently it is doing our 500 repetition.

- [00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1866) However, with this approach, it is very hard to generate long speeches.

- [00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1872) So I will show you which option and which script we are going to use to generate long

- [00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1879) speech consistently.

- [00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1880) Okay, the file is generated inside results.

- [00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1885) Welcome to the software engineering courses channel.

- [00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1887) Sometimes it may not be best.

- [00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1889) Okay, now time to move to our script that will generate entire speeches.

- [00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1895) For my script to work, we need to make a change in the inference.py file.

- [00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1900) So right click edit with notepad plus plus.

- [00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1905) Then find split text function like this and then copy this code.

- [00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1911) Go to your file, find split text.

- [00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1914) It is in the 37th line and replace it with my text.

- [00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1919) Then we are ready to use the script that I'm going to show now.

- [00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1924) Before starting my developed scripts, let me explain to you what this code change will

- [00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1931) make.

- [00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1932) With this way we will be able to provide multiple sentences, separating them with semicolon.

- [00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1939) So here I have a modified command line argument.

- [00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1942) This also takes output directory, so you will learn how to use it as well.

- [00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1948) Let's copy this.

- [00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1949) Let's also add several different sentences to this like I am showing you right now.

- [00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1956) So now I have three sentences separated with a semicolon as you are seeing right now.

- [00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1962) With this command, it will generate three separate voices and one combined voice.

- [00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1967) I will also add two more parameters to improve quality of the generated speech.

- [00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1972) The first one is changing preset to high quality, copy it and change the preset.

- [00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1978) And the second one is the diffusion iterations.

- [00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1981) So I will make the diffusion iterations to 1000 like this.

- [00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1985) I will also set my best epoch checkpoint.

- [00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1989) We need to provide text split argument for this command to work.

- [00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1994) So I will add it to the beginning --text_split.

- [00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=1998) And then you can write here anything like GG.

- [00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=2001) I also have modified the command here as well.

- [00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=2005) So you can check it out.

- [00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=2007) Copy by clicking here.

- [00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=2008) Then you can paste it into any text editor and modify the necessary variables such as

- [00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=2015) output directory, number of iterations you need, your text prompt that you want it to

- [00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=2022) convert into a speech, your checkpoint file.

- [00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=2025) Now I will activate virtual environment.

- [00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=2027) Activate, then move to the correct folders like this and paste the command.

- [00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=2033) It will start with loading TTS and this time you see it shows rendering one of three.

- [00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=2041) Why?

- [00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=2042) Because we have separated our prompt with semicolon and we have three sentences.

- [00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=2049) So you can give it a very big text and you can separate each speech part with a semicolon.

- [00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=2056) Why do you need this separation?

- [00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=2059) Because the model will start hallucinating if you provided a very long text.

- [00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=2064) By default it is split with 200 characters.

- [00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=2069) However, it is not optimal.

- [00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=2071) You should split sentences yourself or use the script that I will show you after this.

- [00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=2078) First file generation has been completed.

- [00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=2080) It automatically moves to second file.

- [00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=2083) It also shows which sentence it is turning into a speech file from here as you are seeing.

- [00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=2090) Generating autoregressive samples is the most time taking part of this methodology.

- [00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=2098) All three samples have been generated.

- [00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=2100) They are saved in this folder that we have provided.

- [00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=2105) So they are inside here.

- [00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=2106) Now let's listen to each one of them and their combined version.

- [00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=2111) Welcome to the software engineering courses channel.

- [00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=2129) If you have noticed that the last sentence was the most weird one.

- [00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=2135) Why?

- [00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=2136) Because this model is not able to generate either very long sentences or very small sentences.

- [00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=2142) Therefore, what can you do?

- [00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=2144) You can merge these two sentences into one sentence and it will significantly improve

- [00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=2149) the output.

- [00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=2150) Let's try again.

- [00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=2151) Since virtual environment is activated, I just copy paste the new command and just hit

- [00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=2156) enter.

- [00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=2157) By the way,: the script will overwrite the previous files if you don't change your output

- [00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=2163) folder.

- [00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=2164) Okay, new generation is completed.

- [00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=2166) Let's listen again.

- [00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=2168) Welcome to the software engineering courses channel.

- [00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=2180) We can further improve our generated speech files by using Adobe podcast.

- [00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=2186) Their service is free.

- [00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=2188) You only need to log in with an account.

- [00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=2191) That account can be a free account.

- [00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=2193) So let's drag and drop this file into here like this.

- [00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=2197) Okay, the enhanced file generated.

- [00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=2200) Let's listen it.

- [00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=2202) Welcome to the software engineering courses channel.

- [00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=2222) Okay, as you are seeing, you can improve your speech by using this Adobe podcast.

- [00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=2229) As you have seen so far, it is very hard to use this technology this way.

- [00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=2235) So we need some kind of automation for it.

- [00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=2238) Let's say you have a speech file like this and you want to process it with a single click.

- [00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=2245) Do not want to spend any time.

- [00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=2247) I have coded three script files as you are seeing right now.

- [00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=2252) They are posted on our Patreon page.

- [00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=2255) All you need is click this link.

- [00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=2258) Download the attached files like this.

- [00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=2261) Click the each file.

- [00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=2262) It will download each of the files.

- [00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=2264) Put them into the folder like this where you have installed.

- [00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=2268) Then follow the instructions written here.

- [00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=2271) I will also show you in a moment what are these files and how to use them.

- [00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=2277) Then modify the necessary parameters as you need as instructed here.

- [00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=2283) I have put every parameter here that you can change and written a great explanation for

- [00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=2289) each one of them.

- [00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=2290) I will also now show you each file and how it works.

- [00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=2295) So our non-Patreon members can also code them and use them.

- [00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=2300) So the very first file is pre-process given text file.py.

- [00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=2305) In this file what we are doing is simple.

- [00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=2308) This file will pre-process our speech file.

- [00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=2313) Let me run it and show you the output.

- [00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=2315) Python pre-process given text file and it is pre-processed.

- [00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=2320) So the speech file will become like this.

- [00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=2322) You see now they are separated with a semicolon.

- [00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=2325) If the sentence is too long then it will split the sentence with a semicolon.

- [00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=2332) Let me show you an example.

- [00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=2334) So I will make one of the sentences very long.

- [00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=2337) Such as let's make here and put a comma so it will separate from here.

- [00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=2342) Okay now you see it is separated from this point.

- [00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=2346) If there is no comma in the long sentence.

- [00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=2348) What will it do?

- [00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=2350) So let's remove the comma from here.

- [00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=2353) Now I will rerun and now this sentence is separated from here.

- [00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=2358) So this script will make your job much easier.

- [00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=2361) With this script.

- [00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=2362) You won't have to manually fix your text file to generate your speech.

- [00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=2367) This will also merge smaller sentences because the model works well with some duration.

- [00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=2375) If it is very small duration like two seconds speech.

- [00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=2379) Then it is not working very well.

- [00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=2380) Or if it is over 12 seconds, it's also not working very well.

- [00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=2385) So this script will also merge these lines as a single line instead of each one is unique

- [00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=2391) line.

- [00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=2392) So let's see the script.

- [00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=2393) The only parameter in this script that you need to modify is the split length.

- [00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=2398) By default it is suggested to split your text with 200 characters.

- [00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=2403) However I am using 175.

- [00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=2406) You can test different values as well.

- [00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=2409) Then we define split sentences function like this.

- [00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=2412) Then we have merge sentences function like this.

- [00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=2416) Then we have process sentences function like this.

- [00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=2419) You can pause the video and code them if you are not our Patreon supporter.

- [00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=2424) Then we have main function like this.

- [00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=2426) And finally, we call the main function here.

- [00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=2429) And let's look at the second file which will make our life much easier.

- [00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=2434) First let me demonstrate you what this script do.

- [00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=2438) Process given speech text.bat file.

- [00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=2441) I will just drag and drop this speech into this bat file and it will start a new cmd.

- [00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=2449) It will automatically preprocess the given text file and it will start generating speeches.

- [00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=2455) Let's see it in real time.

- [00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=2457) So you see with the parameters we did set in that bat file, it started processing the

- [00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=2463) speech.

- [00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=2464) It is generating the first line here.

- [00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=2467) It is one of 19 because our speech is split into 19 parts with semicolon.

- [00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=2474) So the first one is already generated because currently the settings are really fast.

- [00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=2479) You are seeing the IT per seconds.

- [00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=2481) It is really really fast.

- [00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=2483) It is in the fast mode.

- [00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=2484) This is not the best mode, but as you see, you can generate sound files very fast with

- [00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=2490) fast mode.

- [00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=2491) I will explain all of them in a moment.

- [00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=2493) Don't worry.

- [00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=2495) So it already processed five parts of the 19 parts and now let's see the script file.

- [00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=2502) As you are seeing this will make your life much easier.

- [00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=2504) With this script you will be able to generate very long audio files very easily.

- [00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=2511) Just writing your text file, drag and drop it into this script and you will be able to

- [00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=2517) generate your speech.

- [00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=2518) Okay so the script is starting like this.

- [00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=2521) So which parameters you need to change here?

- [00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=2524) In this part.

- [00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=2525) You don't need to change any parameter.

- [00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=2528) Just write it as it is looking.

- [00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=2530) In here I have a lot of explanation as you are seeing.

- [00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=2534) Now this part is important.

- [00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=2536) You need to change this path as in your installation folder.

- [00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=2541) You need to change this part to where you have installed your Tortoise TTS Fast library.

- [00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=2548) You need to change this with the path of your installation where your virtual environment

- [00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=2554) is installed.

- [00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=2555) Of course then you need to change the path here as well.

- [00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=2559) This is really important.

- [00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=2560) Then you need to set your output directory here.

- [00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=2563) This is where your generated speech files will be saved.

- [00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=2568) This is voice directory.

- [00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=2569) I am not sure if this is improving the speech quality or not, but here I am setting my generated

- [00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=2577) wav files as we have shown in the previous parts of the video.

- [00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=2582) Then here we are setting our checkpoint file of our training.

- [00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=2586) So with the other script, you can test multiple checkpoints and use the best one.

- [00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=2592) Then in here there are several parameters you can set.

- [00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=2595) If you have a lower VRAM graphic card.

- [00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=2598) You should start with low VRAM true like this.

- [00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=2602) If you are still failing.

- [00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=2604) You should make preset ultra fast.

- [00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=2606) You can also reduce number of diffusions, but this shouldn't affect your vram usage.

- [00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=2611) However it will make generation faster.

- [00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=2614) If you are still getting out of VRAM error.

- [00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=2617) With these settings, you can also set no cache to true.

- [00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=2622) And still, if you get out of memory error, then as a last step, you can make half true.

- [00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=2629) So the half will reduce your quality significantly.

- [00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=2632) The others will make your generation speed slower such as low vram or no cache.

- [00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=2639) The preset also significantly affects your training quality.

- [00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=2644) So you should try first the other presets like fast, standard.

- [00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=2649) And if you only get out of vram error out of memory error, you should try the lower

- [00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=2656) preset like ultra fast.

- [00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=2659) So these are all the parameters that you need to change.

- [00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=2663) I have written every parameters in our GitHub file so you see each one is written here.

- [00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=2671) And when you set all of them only one time, then you will be able to use same script again

- [00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=2677) and again without doing any other manual thing.

- [00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=2680) Let's say you have encountered a problem.

- [00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=2682) Then we have a Discord server.

- [00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=2685) Click it.

- [00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=2686) Join our server and then you can ask me any questions.

- [00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=2689) You see, we have over 2400 members with over 500 online members.

- [00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=2694) We are growing and I am expecting you to join as well.

- [00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=2698) I have uploaded the file to the Patreon with these settings.

- [00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=2702) No cache false, half false, low vram false, diffusion iterations count 250, preset standard.

- [00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=2711) But as I said, according to your graphic card, you should change them.

- [00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=2715) I think this script works with as low as 6 GB having GPUs maybe 4 GB I didn't test.

- [00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=2722) So it is up to you to do testing.

- [00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=2725) And the next script we have is epoch comparison.

- [00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=2729) This script is pretty much same.

- [00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=2731) You need to change the same parameters.

- [00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=2732) Additionally this script will take your checkpoints folder and then it will generate speech files

- [00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=2742) with each one of the checkpoints.

- [00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=2745) Let me demonstrate you.

- [00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=2746) So here I have a checkpoint tests folder.

- [00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=2750) As you are seeing right now I did put 19 files.

- [00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=2753) It is set as here.

- [00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=2755) Then the outbase directory is set as here.

- [00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=2759) All I need to do is then just drag and drop the speech file into epoch comparison.bat

- [00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=2765) file.

- [00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=2766) It will start with the first checkpoint path it finds.

- [00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=2770) Currently python is sorting with numbering so it starts from 1000.

- [00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=2775) You can change this behavior with adding 00 to each one of the files.

- [00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=2780) Then it will be sorted as expected.

- [00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=2784) Otherwise it will start from zeros like this.

- [00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=2787) And you see it started with the first checkpoint and then it will iteratively load each checkpoint

- [00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=2793) and generate speech files.

- [00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=2795) Now I will show results.

- [00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=2797) So I have done a comprehensive checkpoint comparison with the script.

- [00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=2802) You see, there are 55 checkpoint comparison folders.

- [00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=2807) Then I have written this simple python file to move all of the generated checkpoint sound

- [00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=2814) files into a new folder to be able to test them easily.

- [00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=2819) Here 54 checkpoint comparison generated speech files.

- [00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=2824) Now I will show you some of them and let's see how the output is changing as we do more

- [00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=2831) training.

- [00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=2833) The first numbers are the number of steps and in my case, every four step was one epoch.

- [00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=2840) Therefore 40 step is 10 epoch.

- [00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=2843) Let's begin with listening the 0 step.

- [00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=2848) Meta has introduced ImageBind an open source artificial intelligence model capable of combining

- [00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=2853) and learning from six different types of data or modalities.

- [00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=2857) Let's listen 40 steps 10 epoch.

- [00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=2861) Meta has introduced ImageBind an open source artificial intelligence model capable of combining

- [00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=2866) and learning from six different types of data or modalities.

- [00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=2871) You see.

- [00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=2872) In the end, you may get some hallucination like this because as you generate a bigger

- [00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=2879) speech, it tends to hallucinate.

- [00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=2881) So what you need to do is cutting those parts.

- [00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=2885) Let's listen 40 the epoch.

- [00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=2887) Meta has introduced ImageBind an open source artificial intelligence model capable of combining

- [00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=2893) and learning from six different types of data or modalities.

- [00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=2900) Okay let's listen 80 epoch.

- [00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=2902) Meta has introduced ImageBind an open source artificial intelligence model capable of combining

- [00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=2909) and learning from six different types of data or modalities.

- [00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=2916) Okay let's listen 150 epochs.

- [00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=2919) Meta has introduced ImageBind an open source artificial intelligence model capable of combining

- [00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=2926) and learning from six different types of data or modalities.

- [00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=2933) Let's listen 280 epochs.

- [00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=2935) This is one of the best that I have found personally.

- [00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=2939) Meta has introduced ImageBind an open source artificial intelligence model capable of combining

- [00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=2945) and learning from six different types of data or modalities.

- [00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=2949) Meta often modalities.

- [00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=2950) Unfortunately there is still hallucination, but we can cut that part and use the original

- [00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=2957) generated part.

- [00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=2959) Now I will show you some of the very bigger epoch counts and you will see how it gets

- [00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=2966) over-trained.

- [00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=2967) Let's listen 400 epochs.

- [00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=2969) Meta has introduced ImageBind an open source artificial intelligence model capable of combining

- [00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=2976) and learning from six different types of data or modalities.

- [00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=2980) This almost didn't have any hallucination, but the sound quality decreased.

- [00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=2986) Let's listen 530 epoch and you will see how the sound quality decreased.

- [00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=2992) The loss value of this one was below 0.1.

- [00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=2996) However the lower loss value doesn't always mean that it is better in machine learning

- [00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=3002) because there is a very significant problem described as over-training and as you do more

- [00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=3009) over-training the machine learning model in this case, our trained voice will lose its

- [00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=3016) generalization capability.

- [00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=3018) Therefore, the quality will decrease.

- [00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=3019) Okay let's listen it.

- [00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=3021) Meta has introduced ImageBind an open source artificial intelligence model capable of combining

- [00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=3027) and learning from six different types of data or modalities.

- [00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=3032) So before ending the video, I will show you all of the latest script files.

- [00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=3038) The files are posted on our Patreon.

- [00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=3041) The link will be in the description and also in the GitHub file.

- [00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=3045) You don't need these files to follow this tutorial and also generate speech, but these

- [00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=3052) files will make your job easier.

- [00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=3054) You can just follow our GitHub file this file and everything is also written here that you

- [00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=3060) need along with the options, parameters, commands.

- [00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=3065) So these files are optional.

- [00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=3068) So let's see each one of the files latest versions which are also shared here.

- [00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=3074) The first file is preprocess given text file.

- [00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=3077) I did some updates.

- [00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=3078) So split length that you need to set in this file.

- [00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=3081) You can pause video and type every code if you wish or just download from our Patreon

- [00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=3087) page.

- [00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=3088) So this is the main method as you are seeing right now.

- [00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=3091) I did some improvements, added some replacements.

- [00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=3095) Also one very important thing is limiting the total length because the command line

- [00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=3102) is not allowing you to use infinite number of characters in commands.

- [00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=3107) Therefore we need to limit the total length of the speech.

- [00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=3112) So 7900 is working pretty decent.

- [00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=3115) One another important thing is saving files with utf-8.

- [00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=3119) This is also important.

- [00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=3122) So this is the entire script of the preprocess given text file.

- [00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=3127) Now I will show you more zoomed version so if you want to type you can just pause video

- [00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=3131) and type.

- [00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=3132) Here another part.

- [00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=3133) I am just showing you with a little bit scrolling and here the last part.

- [00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=3139) If you be generous, become our Patreon supporter and download from Patreon.

- [00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=3143) I would appreciate that very much.

- [00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=3145) So the second file is process given speech text.bat file.

- [00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=3151) I have modified the input code.

- [00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=3153) Because it wasn't able to read exclamation character.

- [00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=3156) Therefore we have modified this part of this script.

- [00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=3160) This is improved script.

- [00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=3161) It is working very well.

- [00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=3164) So here you are seeing the other parts.

- [00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=3165) Don't forget to change this path.

- [00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=3168) Also this path.

- [00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=3170) These are important.

- [00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=3171) From this part of the code.

- [00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=3173) You don't need to change anything.

- [00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=3175) Also don't forget to change this path as well and also this path as well.

- [00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=3179) These are important.

- [00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=3180) You can also change the parameters here.

- [00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=3183) As you are seeing I have typed every one of the parameters.

- [00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=3187) Personally I find that turning off voice fixer with false and using Adobe speech enhancer

- [00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=3193) is working better.

- [00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=3194) This is posted on the GitHub file.

- [00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=3197) You see I said that you can turn off voice fixer and use podcast Adobe to enhance generated

- [00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=3203) speech file.

- [00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=3204) Also I have enabled low VRAM.

- [00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=3206) You can also change other settings.

- [00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=3208) All of them are written on here.

- [00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=3211) So read here carefully and set your parameters as you wish.

- [00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=3216) So this is the entire script.

- [00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=3218) This part.

- [00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=3219) This part.

- [00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=3220) And this part.

- [00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=3221) Just pause the video and write it if you wish.

- [00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=3224) Okay one another file is epoch comparison.

- [00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=3226) Epoch comparison is really important because finding the best epoch otherwise would take

- [00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=3233) a lot of time.

- [00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=3234) Therefore this is the beginning of the epoch comparison file.

- [00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=3238) Actually until this part it is exactly same as process given speech text.bat file.

- [00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=3245) So in here we have this part.

- [00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=3247) Okay in this script don't forget to change this path.

- [00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=3251) This is important.

- [00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=3252) Also don't forget to change this path.

- [00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=3254) This is important.

- [00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=3255) Don't forget to set your checkpoints directory.

- [00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=3258) Don't forget to change your output base directory here as well.

- [00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=3263) These are all important settings that you need to make for to use this script.

- [00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=3268) Also in here.

- [00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=3269) Again there are parameters like you are seeing right now.

- [00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=3272) You can use this.

- [00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=3274) You may wonder what is candidates.

- [00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=3276) Candidates is extremely important parameter.

- [00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=3279) I will show you in a moment.

- [00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=3280) So this is the end of the script.

- [00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=3283) Just pause the video and type them if you wish or download from our Patreon page.

- [00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=3288) So let me show you what does candidates do.

- [00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=3291) Here you are seeing 10 candidates generated for each speech sentence.

- [00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=3296) I will demonstrate them one by one.

- [00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=3299) So let's see several candidates for the first speech.

- [00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=3303) Hello and welcome one and all.

- [00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=3306) Today we are embarking on an exciting journey through the most intuitive and comprehensive

- [00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=3311) deep voice cloning tutorial you will find anywhere.

- [00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=3315) Our mission: let's see the second generated candidate for this speech.

- [00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=3320) Hello and welcome one and all.

- [00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=3323) Today we are embarking on an exciting journey through the most intuitive and comprehensive

- [00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=3329) deep voice cloning tutorial you will find anywhere.

- [00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=3334) Our mission: let's see the third candidate.

- [00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=3336) So by generating multiple candidates, you can pick the best generated voice and use

- [00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=3342) it.

- [00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=3343) This is the logic of it and it is also pretty fast because only the last diffusion part

- [00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=3348) is used to generate different candidates.

- [00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=3351) Hello and welcome one and all.

- [00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=3354) Today we are embarking on an exciting journey through the most intuitive and comprehensive

- [00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=3360) deep voice cloning tutorial you will find anywhere.

- [00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=3363) Our mission: you understand the logic.

- [00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=3366) So the last script that I will show you is move checkpoint sound files.

- [00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=3372) Because the checkpoint files are generated like this and we want to move all of them

- [00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=3376) into a single folder if we want to compare them easily.

- [00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=3380) So you see I have moved all of them here and let's open move checkpoint sound files.

- [00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=3386) So this is the script of the move checkpoint sound files.

- [00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=3390) Don't forget to change this path and also this path.

- [00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=3394) This is a pretty simple script.

- [00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=3396) One another important thing is your speech.txt file.

- [00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=3400) Make sure that its encoding is UTF-8.

- [00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=3403) This is important because if you don't use UTF-8 then the special characters won't be

- [00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=3411) saved.

- [00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=3412) Also try to avoid using special characters like this one because they are not correctly

- [00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=3417) read with the command line interface and also probably they won't be understood by the trained

- [00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=3424) voice model.

- [00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=3425) So use UTF-8 and also try to avoid using special characters.

- [00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=3431) One another very important thing is try to avoid writing abbreviations like PhD because

- [00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=3437) model is not able to understand all of the abbreviations.

- [00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=3441) So what can you do?

- [00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=3442) Instead of PhD you can write doctor of philosophy the full sentence of the abbreviation.

- [00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=3448) These are all important things.

- [00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=3450) I hope you have enjoyed.

- [00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMRlqcgDL0&t=3451) I have spent quite a bit time to prepare this tutorial about a one week.
