In this video I have intensively compared RTX 5090 speed on FLUX DEV, FLUX Fill, SD 3.5 Large, SD 3.5 Medium, Stable Diffusion XL (SDXL) and Stable Diffusion 1.5 (SD 1.5) models. For each benchmark, I have compared RTX 5090 against RTX 3090 TI so we see the speed improvement. Moreover, I have tested FP8 vs 16-bit precision for FLUX and SD 3.5 Large and SD 3.5 Medium models. Furthermore, I have tested the speed impact of changing prompt on FLUX DEV model since one of the follower had requested. Full specs of the system provided below.

I have used SwarmUI with ComfyUI backend so these benchmarks are literally done on ComfyUI you can think as. Currently no other interface / UI supporting RTX 5000 series as far as i know.

### Video Transcription


- [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHlGzaDLkto&t=0) Greetings everyone. Today, I am going to&nbsp; test RTX 5090 on SwarmUI with FLUX models,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHlGzaDLkto&t=8) Stable Diffusion XL, SDXL models, Stable&nbsp; Diffusion 3 model, and also Stable Diffusion&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHlGzaDLkto&t=16) 1.5 models. Currently, SwarmUI is not natively&nbsp; supporting RTX 5000 series yet, but don't worry,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHlGzaDLkto&t=26) at the end of the video, I will show you&nbsp; installation and download of the models. So,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHlGzaDLkto&t=31) as usual, I have added two backends. One of them&nbsp; is RTX 5090 and the other one is RTX 3090 Ti. And&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHlGzaDLkto&t=40) I did set the FLUX DEV parameters. The model&nbsp; is selected, 20 steps. I am going to generate&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHlGzaDLkto&t=46) 10 images, so let's see its speed with 1 megapixel&nbsp; resolution. Let's generate. Meanwhile, generating,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHlGzaDLkto&t=54) let's watch the values of the GPUs. So, let's&nbsp; reset, and let's also reset this one. Currently,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHlGzaDLkto&t=62) I am generating images with FP8 precision. When we&nbsp; go to the server and logs, we will see the speed&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHlGzaDLkto&t=70) of the generations and we are seeing the per step&nbsp; speed. Unfortunately, it is lower than what it is,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHlGzaDLkto&t=79) because I am recording a video right now.&nbsp; I will stop the video and generate again&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHlGzaDLkto&t=84) and show you its optimal speed when there is no&nbsp; recording. And the images are getting generated&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHlGzaDLkto&t=91) right now. I have generated few images while&nbsp; the video recording has been turned off and we&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHlGzaDLkto&t=98) can see that it is taking around 10 seconds&nbsp; for generating images on RTX 5090 and 25,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHlGzaDLkto&t=107) 26 seconds to generate on RTX 3090 Ti. So, the&nbsp; step speed is around 2.2 IT per second and 1.27&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHlGzaDLkto&t=119) seconds per IT. We can see that RTX 5090 is 2.5&nbsp; times faster at 8-bit precision. Now, I am going&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHlGzaDLkto&t=130) to change the precision to 16 bit from here, Now,&nbsp; I am going to change the precision to 16 bit from&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHlGzaDLkto&t=134) here, and I am also going to select the 16 bit&nbsp; precision Clip model from here. This is improving&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHlGzaDLkto&t=143) quality for sure, and let's see the new speed.&nbsp; Let's generate. Let's generate. This will not fit&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHlGzaDLkto&t=150) into VRAM of the RTX 3090 Ti possibly, especially&nbsp; if it is your primary GPU because your Windows&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHlGzaDLkto&t=159) will be also using VRAM. But let's see its&nbsp; speed. It will be doing some offloading probably,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHlGzaDLkto&t=167) so it will be possibly slower. Now, both of the&nbsp; GPUs are running. You see, this is the watt usages&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHlGzaDLkto&t=173) as you are seeing right now. Let's go to the&nbsp; server debug. So, these are the speeds. Now,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHlGzaDLkto&t=179) I will turn off video recording to get perfect&nbsp; timing. Alright, few images have been generated&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHlGzaDLkto&t=187) and we can see that RTX 5090 is faster in 16-bit&nbsp; precision. It is now 9.55 seconds for per image&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHlGzaDLkto&t=200) and RTX 3090 Ti is taking around 30 seconds&nbsp; for per image. So, RTX 5090 is 3 times faster&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHlGzaDLkto&t=211) than RTX 3090 Ti. Now, I am going to test FLUX&nbsp; fill dev model. Let's edit this image and let's&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHlGzaDLkto&t=221) inpaint somewhere of the image. Perhaps here,&nbsp; here, and let's say green car light. It is not&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHlGzaDLkto&t=230) important. We just want to see how it works. So,&nbsp; the model is selected. Init Image Creativity 1,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHlGzaDLkto&t=236) Init Image Reset To Norm to 1. And we also need&nbsp; to set the FLUX guidance scale as 30. And let's&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHlGzaDLkto&t=245) generate some images with the FLUX fill dev model.&nbsp; Okay, so the generations has been started. Now,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHlGzaDLkto&t=252) I will stop video recording and test its maximum&nbsp; performance. Let me also show you the status of&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHlGzaDLkto&t=262) the GPU and the usage and the watts, as you are&nbsp; seeing right now. It is almost using the maximum&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHlGzaDLkto&t=268) power and these are the power limits. We can also&nbsp; see the values here, the GPU temperature, hotspot&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHlGzaDLkto&t=276) and everything is displayed on the screen right&nbsp; now. You can just pause the video and check them&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHlGzaDLkto&t=281) out if you wish. Alright, the images have been&nbsp; generated. I slightly modified and made it bigger&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHlGzaDLkto&t=288) and we can see that the duration is almost same as&nbsp; the FLUX dev model with the FLUX fill model. Now,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHlGzaDLkto&t=297) I am going to test changing prompt speed because&nbsp; someone asked me to do that to see the difference&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHlGzaDLkto&t=305) between changing prompts or not. So, for this&nbsp; test, I am going to use FLUX dev model. I am&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHlGzaDLkto&t=312) going to generate two images. Let's load now. I&nbsp; will stop video recording to see its real impact&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHlGzaDLkto&t=319) when we change prompt, how much time it takes,&nbsp; how much difference it makes to compare it to&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHlGzaDLkto&t=326) generating multiple images with the same prompt.&nbsp; Alright, changing prompt added significant amount&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHlGzaDLkto&t=334) of duration to the generations from around 9.7,&nbsp; 9.6 second to 13.4, 12.5 second generation. So,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHlGzaDLkto&t=347) it increased the image generation duration around&nbsp; 30% whenever you change a prompt. We can see the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHlGzaDLkto&t=354) same behavior on RTX 3090 Ti as well. It is&nbsp; increased to 36, 37 seconds from 30 second,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHlGzaDLkto&t=365) 29.5 second. So, changing prompt has such dramatic&nbsp; impact because it is encoding the prompt with the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHlGzaDLkto&t=376) T5 XXL encoder model. Therefore, it is adding&nbsp; a delay whenever you change a prompt. Now,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHlGzaDLkto&t=383) I will show you the speed of the generations&nbsp; on SD 3.5 Medium model. So, I am selecting this&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHlGzaDLkto&t=393) model and let's see the generation speeds. Let's&nbsp; generate 10 images. I will set the CFG scale to 7&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHlGzaDLkto&t=401) and the rest is same. I am going to make the test&nbsp; with FP8 first, then I will test with FP16. Let's&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHlGzaDLkto&t=410) begin. In the first generation, I will show you&nbsp; the values, then I will turn off the recording&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHlGzaDLkto&t=416) and test again. So, let's see the values of the&nbsp; GPU. The generations has started. We can see that&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHlGzaDLkto&t=425) it is using lesser VRAM because currently we&nbsp; are at the FP8 precision. We can see the CPU&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHlGzaDLkto&t=433) usages as well. Let's reset. Okay, memory clock,&nbsp; GPU clock. The GPU clock is just mind blowing,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHlGzaDLkto&t=441) as you can see right now. Let's see the IT per&nbsp; second while recording a video. Yes, yes, it&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHlGzaDLkto&t=449) is just mind blowing 4.7 IT per second, as you are&nbsp; seeing on RTX 5090. And RTX 3090 Ti is 2.38 IT per&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHlGzaDLkto&t=459) second. All images have been generated with the SD&nbsp; 3.5 Medium model. We can see the generations. Now,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHlGzaDLkto&t=467) I will turn off video recording and test again.&nbsp; Alright, the generations has been completed. It&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHlGzaDLkto&t=473) is taking 3.88 seconds on RTX 5090 and 8.6 second&nbsp; on RTX 3090 Ti. Now, let's try the generation in&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHlGzaDLkto&t=486) 16 bit precision and let's see if there is any&nbsp; difference or not. The 16-bit precision image&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHlGzaDLkto&t=493) generations also took same amount of time.&nbsp; I didn't see any significant difference. So,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHlGzaDLkto&t=501) since both of them is fitting into the VRAM, there&nbsp; is no issues and there is no difference. I am&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHlGzaDLkto&t=507) downloading the large model as well and now I am&nbsp; going to test large model with the same way. Okay,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHlGzaDLkto&t=514) currently generating images with the SD 3.5 Large&nbsp; model and you can see that both of the GPUs are&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHlGzaDLkto&t=520) running with maximum performance. We can see that&nbsp; 100 percentage of usage. They are both fitting&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHlGzaDLkto&t=529) into the VRAM even at the 16 bit precision. We&nbsp; can see that it is using the entire GPU power. 575&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHlGzaDLkto&t=539) watts and 450 watts. If you want to see the GPU, I&nbsp; already made a tutorial video about it. It will be&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHlGzaDLkto&t=546) in the playlist that will be in the link of this&nbsp; video. So, I recommend to watch this first video&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHlGzaDLkto&t=553) to learn more information about the GPU and how I&nbsp; am using it in my machine. Alright, so 10 images&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHlGzaDLkto&t=561) have been generated while I am not recording and&nbsp; we can see that for Stable Diffusion 3.5 Large&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHlGzaDLkto&t=569) model, RTX 5090 is performing around 9 seconds&nbsp; for per image and RTX 3090 Ti is taking around&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHlGzaDLkto&t=579) 21 seconds for per image. Another thing is that I&nbsp; am running my RTX 5090 slightly overclocked. You&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHlGzaDLkto&t=589) can see plus 1,500 memory and plus 300 GPU&nbsp; clock. Now, I will repeat the test on SDXL&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHlGzaDLkto&t=599) and SD 1.5 model. All of the models are tested&nbsp; at 1 megapixel, except I will make the test with&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHlGzaDLkto&t=608) SD 1.5 with 768 to 768. For SDXL testing, I&nbsp; am going to use SDXL Juggernaut XL version 11&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHlGzaDLkto&t=619) and let's see. Okay, the tests are beginning very&nbsp; quickly. We can see the speed. Wow, the speed is&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHlGzaDLkto&t=627) almost real time. This is 20 steps. This is not a&nbsp; lightning model and real time you are watching the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHlGzaDLkto&t=634) speed of generation on RTX 5090. It is just mind&nbsp; blowing. Yes, already completed. Let's generate&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHlGzaDLkto&t=643) 20 more images. As you are seeing the values here.&nbsp; It is just too fast and yes, the images are just&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHlGzaDLkto&t=651) popping up. Let's see the IT per second. Wow. Wow,&nbsp; it is just amazing 8.8 IT per second. I mean just&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHlGzaDLkto&t=662) mind blowing. So, to see the real speed, I will&nbsp; now stop recording and let's see then. Alright,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHlGzaDLkto&t=669) SDXL is taking only 2.2 second on RTX 5090 and 5&nbsp; second on RTX 3090 Ti. We are doing 20 steps so&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHlGzaDLkto&t=681) far. Let's see the step speeds in the debug menu.&nbsp; Yes. So, we see that it is 10.1 IT per second for&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHlGzaDLkto&t=692) RTX 5090 on SDXL and 4.2 IT per second on RTX&nbsp; 3090 Ti for SDXL. It is time to test SD 1.5. For&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHlGzaDLkto&t=705) SD 1.5, I am going to test SD 1.5 Realistic Vision&nbsp; version 6. I am going to change the resolution to&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHlGzaDLkto&t=713) 768 to 768, otherwise it is too big resolution&nbsp; for SD 1.5 and let's see the speed. Okay, yes,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHlGzaDLkto&t=723) even this resolution is sometimes too big, but the&nbsp; speed is just mind blowing as you are seeing. Yes,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHlGzaDLkto&t=731) you see? They are just popping up, popping up,&nbsp; almost instant. Wow, just mind blowing. Now,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHlGzaDLkto&t=738) let me stop the video and see. Alright, the speed&nbsp; is just mind blowing. We can see that 1.2 seconds&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHlGzaDLkto&t=747) for RTX 5090 and 2.2 seconds for RTX 3090 Ti.&nbsp; Let's see the step speed. These speeds are just&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHlGzaDLkto&t=756) mind blowing and yes, we can see that it is 19 IT&nbsp; per second, almost 10 IT per second. So, these are&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHlGzaDLkto&t=766) the speeds for SD 1.5 at 768 to 768 resolution.&nbsp; This is just amazing. So, I have prepared a table&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHlGzaDLkto&t=776) for you to see everything in a single place. I&nbsp; have made some extra testing. Stable diffusion&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHlGzaDLkto&t=784) 1.5 at 512 pixel resolution. So, the average image&nbsp; generation takes 1.14 seconds for RTX 3090 Ti and&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHlGzaDLkto&t=800) 0.64 seconds for RTX 5090. These are all 20 steps.&nbsp; The step speeds are also calculated based on the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHlGzaDLkto&t=812) average times. So, actually they are little bit&nbsp; faster because it doesn't include VAE decoding.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHlGzaDLkto&t=821) So, with the SD 1.5 at 768 pixel resolution, the&nbsp; timing increases average to 2.23 second for 3090&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHlGzaDLkto&t=832) Ti and 1.2 seconds for the RTX 5090. You can&nbsp; see that the speed differences are also like&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHlGzaDLkto&t=842) this. Especially we see more difference as we&nbsp; go to the more demanding models. For example,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHlGzaDLkto&t=849) SDXL, the RTX 5090 is 2.35 times faster than RTX&nbsp; 3090 Ti. With Stable Diffusion 3 Large model,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHlGzaDLkto&t=861) when we run it at FP8 precision, it is 2.42&nbsp; times faster. When it is 16-bit precision, it&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHlGzaDLkto&t=871) is 2.5 times faster. Especially when we run FLUX&nbsp; at 16-bit precision, which is the highest quality,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHlGzaDLkto&t=881) RTX 5090 is 3.08 times faster. Yes, this is a&nbsp; really, really significant speed difference. We&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHlGzaDLkto&t=893) can see that it is taking on average 10.67 second&nbsp; to generate one image. The lowest generation is&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHlGzaDLkto&t=902) 9.39 second and the highest generation took 20.68&nbsp; second. This is probably not very accurate. I used&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHlGzaDLkto&t=913) AI to parse the logs, but it was on average around&nbsp; 9 to 10 seconds as we have seen. So, the relative&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHlGzaDLkto&t=923) speeds are probably very accurate. So, this is the&nbsp; table. Just pause the video and look carefully if&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHlGzaDLkto&t=930) you wish. Now, how you can install SwarmUI and&nbsp; make it compatible with RTX 5090 series, this is&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHlGzaDLkto&t=940) the part where I will explain how to install it.&nbsp; For installation, there is a post on this GitHub&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHlGzaDLkto&t=948) repository. You can follow this post. However, I&nbsp; have prepared one click installer as well. The one&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHlGzaDLkto&t=955) click installer is included in our SwarmUI easy&nbsp; ultra fast and robust unified downloader. The&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHlGzaDLkto&t=962) link will be in the description of the video&nbsp; and in this post, just download this SwarmUI&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHlGzaDLkto&t=968) model downloader version 20 zip file. Extract it&nbsp; into any folder you wish. Let's extract into my E&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHlGzaDLkto&t=976) drive and once you extract the content, you will&nbsp; see that there is SwarmUI installation. SwarmUI&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHlGzaDLkto&t=984) Windows installer. This will start the official&nbsp; installation. Let me demonstrate you quickly. So,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHlGzaDLkto&t=990) it is starting. It is starting to install. It is&nbsp; pretty fast. This is the official installation as&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHlGzaDLkto&t=996) I said. The installation started, you see, it&nbsp; is started at this URL. You can also see that&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHlGzaDLkto&t=1001) it is started here. Then agree, just actually&nbsp; let's say customize settings, modern dark, next,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHlGzaDLkto&t=1009) just yourself, ComfyUI local. I am not going to&nbsp; download anything and yes, I am sure to install.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHlGzaDLkto&t=1016) Wait for installation to be completed. Meanwhile,&nbsp; you can also download any models that you want.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHlGzaDLkto&t=1022) We have very fast downloader. You see Windows&nbsp; download models.bat file. Double click it and&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHlGzaDLkto&t=1028) run anyway. We have downloading feature for all&nbsp; these models. Just read here. You see FP16 FLUX&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHlGzaDLkto&t=1038) Dev, FP8 FLUX Dev, FP16 Stable Diffusion 3.5&nbsp; Large, FP8 scaled Stable Diffusion 3.5 Large,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHlGzaDLkto&t=1047) T5 XXL FP16 version, FP8 scaled T5 version,&nbsp; which works better. Stable diffusion 3.5 Medium,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHlGzaDLkto&t=1058) FP8 scaled Stable Diffusion 3.5 Medium. If it is&nbsp; scaled, it means that its weights are optimized.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHlGzaDLkto&t=1065) So, it is in half precision, but it is improved&nbsp; than the half precision. We have the segmentation&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHlGzaDLkto&t=1073) models. We have text to video model Genmo Mochi&nbsp; 1. This is also still working. We have FLUX Redux,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHlGzaDLkto&t=1080) Depth, Canny, FLUX fill model for inpainting&nbsp; and outpainting. We have the newest better&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHlGzaDLkto&t=1086) clip large model. In my all experimentation so&nbsp; far, this works better than the default clip&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHlGzaDLkto&t=1092) large model. We have the very best deterministic&nbsp; upscale models, which I recommend. So, you can&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHlGzaDLkto&t=1099) download all of them, just type whichever you want&nbsp; to download like this and it will download all of&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHlGzaDLkto&t=1104) them with amazing speed. Let me demonstrate you.&nbsp; So, the first file is small one, it is slower,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHlGzaDLkto&t=1111) then it will become very, very fast when&nbsp; downloading a bigger file. Yes, it is downloading&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHlGzaDLkto&t=1116) with 100 megabytes, 200 megabytes per second.&nbsp; So, this is depending on your internet speed,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHlGzaDLkto&t=1123) of course, but this is optimized to use your&nbsp; entire network speed, 200 megabytes per second,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHlGzaDLkto&t=1130) 300 megabytes per second. You can use this&nbsp; downloader to download anything you wish. Okay,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHlGzaDLkto&t=1136) let's see our installation. I think it is&nbsp; completed. Yes, the SwarmUI has been loaded. Now,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHlGzaDLkto&t=1143) what I am going to do is I will upgrade the&nbsp; ComfyUI backend automatically for you so that&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHlGzaDLkto&t=1150) it will work with the RTX 5090 series, RTX 50&nbsp; series. It can be RTX 5080, 5070, 5060. Currently&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHlGzaDLkto&t=1161) natively, it is not supported, so you need to&nbsp; do this. So, let's close this. Then double click&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHlGzaDLkto&t=1167) SwarmUI upgrade Torch. This is going to download&nbsp; the pre-made ComfyUI backend into the accurate&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHlGzaDLkto&t=1175) folder. You see, it is downloading with 8 threads,&nbsp; so it is super fast. Then it will delete the older&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHlGzaDLkto&t=1182) one. Be careful with that because if you have&nbsp; other extensions, installations or other stuff,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHlGzaDLkto&t=1188) they will be all deleted in the ComfyUI backend,&nbsp; not anywhere else. So, you can also make a new&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHlGzaDLkto&t=1195) fresh installation and install it there. So, which&nbsp; folder this is going to delete? This is going to&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHlGzaDLkto&t=1200) delete the DBL backend, ComfyUI, Python embedded.&nbsp; This is going to delete this folder. You see,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHlGzaDLkto&t=1208) it deleted it, then it will extract the&nbsp; content and it will not do anything else. So,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHlGzaDLkto&t=1214) whatever installed inside this Python embedded&nbsp; folder will be deleted and will be replaced&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHlGzaDLkto&t=1219) with pre-made by ComfyUI developers themselves.&nbsp; And the SwarmUI will start supporting RTX 5000&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHlGzaDLkto&t=1228) series. This is all for today. Hopefully, I will&nbsp; be making much more AI related and other test&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHlGzaDLkto&t=1236) videos for RTX 5090. Keep watching. It will be&nbsp; inside the playlist. You see RTX 5090 benchmarks,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHlGzaDLkto&t=1243) tests and experiments. So, stay subscribed,&nbsp; make a reply and tell me which videos, which&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHlGzaDLkto&t=1250) AI models you would like to see and hopefully I&nbsp; will try to make them. See you later. Thank you.
