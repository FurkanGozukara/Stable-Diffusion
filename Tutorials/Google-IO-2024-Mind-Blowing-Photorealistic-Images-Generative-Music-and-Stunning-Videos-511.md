### Video Transcription


- [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4EGp1vcKMs&t=0) Okay, we continue to the Google I.O. 2024 with the part 5.

- [00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4EGp1vcKMs&t=12) Thanks, Demis.

- [00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4EGp1vcKMs&t=14) Over the past few months, we've been working hard to build a new image generation model from the ground up.

- [00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4EGp1vcKMs&t=21) With stronger evaluations, extensive red teaming, and state-of-the-art watermarking with Synth ID.

- [00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4EGp1vcKMs&t=28) Today, I'm so excited to introduce Imagine 3. It's our most capable image generation model yet.

- [00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4EGp1vcKMs&t=36) Imagine 3 is more photorealistic. You can literally count the whiskers on its snout.

- [00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4EGp1vcKMs&t=42) With richer details, like this incredible sunlight in the shot, and fewer visual artifacts or distorted images.

- [00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4EGp1vcKMs&t=50) It understands prompts written the way people write. The more creative and detailed you are, the better.

- [00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4EGp1vcKMs&t=56) And Imagine 3 remembers to incorporate small details like the wildflowers or small blue bird in this longer prompt.

- [00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4EGp1vcKMs&t=64) Plus, this is our best model yet for rendering text, which has been a challenge for image generation models.

- [00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4EGp1vcKMs&t=71) In side-by-side comparisons, independent evaluators preferred Imagine 3 over other popular image generation models.

- [00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4EGp1vcKMs&t=79) In sum, Imagine 3 is our highest quality image generation model so far.

- [00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4EGp1vcKMs&t=83) You can sign up today to try Imagine 3 in ImageFX, part of our suite of AI tools at labs.google.

- [00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4EGp1vcKMs&t=90) It'll be coming soon to developers and enterprise customers in Vertex AI.

- [00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4EGp1vcKMs&t=96) Another area full of creative possibility is generative music.

- [00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4EGp1vcKMs&t=101) I've been working in this space for over 20 years, and this is by far the most exciting year of my career.

- [00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4EGp1vcKMs&t=107) We're exploring ways of working with artists to expand their creativity with AI.

- [00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4EGp1vcKMs&t=111) Together with YouTube, we've been building Music AI Sandbox, a suite of professional music AI tools that can create new instrumental sections from scratch, transfer styles between tracks, and more.

- [00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4EGp1vcKMs&t=124) To help us design and test them, we've been working closely with incredible musicians, songwriters, and producers.

- [00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4EGp1vcKMs&t=131) Some of them made even entirely new songs in ways that would have not been possible without these tools.

- [00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4EGp1vcKMs&t=137) Let's hear from some of the artists we've been working with.

- [00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4EGp1vcKMs&t=139) Let's hear from some of the artists we've been working with.

- [00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4EGp1vcKMs&t=147) I'm going to put this right back into the Music AI tool.

- [00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4EGp1vcKMs&t=153) What happens if Haiti meets Brazil?

- [00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4EGp1vcKMs&t=156) Dude, I have no clue what's about to be spread out.

- [00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4EGp1vcKMs&t=160) This is what excites me.

- [00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4EGp1vcKMs&t=166) As a hip-hop producer, we dug in the crates.

- [00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4EGp1vcKMs&t=169) We're playing these vinyls, and the part where there's no vocal, we pull it, we sample it, and we create an entire song around that.

- [00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4EGp1vcKMs&t=177) So right now we're digging in an infinite crate. It's endless.

- [00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4EGp1vcKMs&t=180) Where I found the AI really useful for me, this way to like fill in the sparser sort of elements of my loops.

- [00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4EGp1vcKMs&t=187) Okay, let's try bongos. We're going to put viola. We're going to put rhythmic clapping.

- [00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4EGp1vcKMs&t=194) And we're going to see what happens there.

- [00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4EGp1vcKMs&t=196) And it makes it sound, ironically, at the end of the day, a little more human.

- [00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4EGp1vcKMs&t=201) So then this is entirely Google's loops right here. These are gloops.

- [00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4EGp1vcKMs&t=209) It's like having like this weird friend that's just like, try this, try that.

- [00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4EGp1vcKMs&t=214) And then you're like, oh, okay, yeah, no, that's pretty dope.

- [00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4EGp1vcKMs&t=216) The tools are capable of speeding up the process of what's in my head getting it out.

- [00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4EGp1vcKMs&t=229) You're able to move light speed with your creativity.

- [00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4EGp1vcKMs&t=232) This is amazing.

- [00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4EGp1vcKMs&t=234) That right there?

- [00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4EGp1vcKMs&t=236) I think this really shows what's possible when we work with the artist community on the future of music.

- [00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4EGp1vcKMs&t=249) You can find some brand new songs from these acclaimed artists and songwriters on their YouTube channels now.

- [00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4EGp1vcKMs&t=255) There's one more area I'm really excited to share with you.

- [00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4EGp1vcKMs&t=259) Our teams have made some incredible progress in Genitive Video.

- [00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4EGp1vcKMs&t=263) Today, I'm excited to announce our newest, most capable Genitive Video model called Veo.

- [00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4EGp1vcKMs&t=274) Veo creates high quality 1080p videos from text, image and video prompts.

- [00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4EGp1vcKMs&t=281) It can capture the details of your instructions in different visual and cinematic styles.

- [00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4EGp1vcKMs&t=286) You can prompt for things like aerial shots of a landscape or time lapse

- [00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4EGp1vcKMs&t=289) and further edit your videos using additional prompts.

- [00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4EGp1vcKMs&t=293) You can use Veo in our new experimental tool called Video FX.

- [00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4EGp1vcKMs&t=297) We're exploring features like storyboarding and generating longer scenes.

- [00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4EGp1vcKMs&t=302) Veo gives you unprecedented creative control.

- [00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4EGp1vcKMs&t=307) Techniques for generating static images have come a long way, but generating video is a different challenge altogether.

- [00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4EGp1vcKMs&t=314) Not only is it important to understand where an object or subject should be in space,

- [00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4EGp1vcKMs&t=319) it needs to maintain this consistency over time, just like the car in this video.

- [00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4EGp1vcKMs&t=325) Veo builds upon years of our pioneering Genitive Video model work,

- [00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4EGp1vcKMs&t=330) including GQN, Finaki, Walt, Video Poet, Lumiere and much more.

- [00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4EGp1vcKMs&t=336) We combine the best of these architectures and techniques to improve consistency, quality and output resolution.

- [00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4EGp1vcKMs&t=343) To see what Veo can do, we put it in the hands of an amazing filmmaker.

- [00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4EGp1vcKMs&t=347) Let's take a look.

- [00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4EGp1vcKMs&t=352) Well, I've been interested in AI for a couple of years now.

- [00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4EGp1vcKMs&t=356) We got in contact with some of the people at Google and they had been working on something of their own.

- [00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4EGp1vcKMs&t=361) So we're all meeting here at Google Farms to make a short film.

- [00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4EGp1vcKMs&t=365) The core technology is Google DeepMind's Generative Video model

- [00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4EGp1vcKMs&t=370) that has been trained to convert input text into output video.

- [00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4EGp1vcKMs&t=375) It looks good.

- [00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4EGp1vcKMs&t=377) We are able to bring ideas to life that were otherwise not possible.

- [00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4EGp1vcKMs&t=382) We can visualize things on a time scale that's 10 or 100 times faster than before.

- [00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4EGp1vcKMs&t=387) When you're shooting, you can't reiterate as much as you wish.

- [00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4EGp1vcKMs&t=390) And so we've been hearing the feedback that it allows for more optionality, more iteration, more improvisation.

- [00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4EGp1vcKMs&t=397) But that's what's cool about it. It's like you can make a mistake faster.

- [00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4EGp1vcKMs&t=400) That's all you really want at the end of the day. At least in art, it's just to make mistakes fast.

- [00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4EGp1vcKMs&t=404) So using Gemini's multimodal capabilities to optimize the model training process,

- [00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4EGp1vcKMs&t=409) Vio is able to better capture the nuance from prompts.

- [00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4EGp1vcKMs&t=412) So this includes cinematic techniques and visual effects, giving you total creative control.

- [00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4EGp1vcKMs&t=419) Everybody's going to become a director and everybody should be a director.

- [00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4EGp1vcKMs&t=423) Because at the heart of all of this is just storytelling.

- [00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4EGp1vcKMs&t=425) The closer we are to being able to tell each other our stories, the more we'll understand each other.

- [00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4EGp1vcKMs&t=430) These models are really enabling us to be more creative and to share that creativity with each other.

- [00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4EGp1vcKMs&t=452) Over the coming weeks, some of these features will be available to select creators through video effects at labs.google.

- [00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4EGp1vcKMs&t=458) And the wait list is open now.

- [00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4EGp1vcKMs&t=461) Of course, these advances in generative video go beyond the beautiful visuals you've seen today.

- [00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4EGp1vcKMs&t=467) By teaching future AI models how to solve problems creatively or in effect simulate the physics of our world,

- [00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4EGp1vcKMs&t=474) we can build more useful systems that can help people communicate in new ways and thereby advance the frontiers of AI.

- [00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4EGp1vcKMs&t=482) When we first began this journey to build AI more than 15 years ago,

- [00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4EGp1vcKMs&t=486) we knew that one day it would change everything.

- [00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4EGp1vcKMs&t=490) Now that time is here.

- [00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4EGp1vcKMs&t=492) And we continue to be amazed by the progress we see and inspired by the advances still to come on the path to AGI.

- [00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4EGp1vcKMs&t=500) Thanks and back to you Sundar.
