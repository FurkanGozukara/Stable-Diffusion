### Video Transcription


- [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-lZ_5DsuTE&t=0) For Programming, we will use IDE, which&nbsp; is Integrated Development Environment.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-lZ_5DsuTE&t=5) Let's check it from Wikipedia. All the features&nbsp; you need C-Sharp provides you. However, of course,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-lZ_5DsuTE&t=14) there are different programming languages&nbsp; for different tasks. So in this course,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-lZ_5DsuTE&t=18) we will use Microsoft Visual Studio as&nbsp; an Integrated Development Environment.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-lZ_5DsuTE&t=24) This IDE is free. So I will show you&nbsp; how to install Microsoft Visual Studio&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-lZ_5DsuTE&t=31) in this lecture and we will start programming in&nbsp; the next lecture. So I am going to click download&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-lZ_5DsuTE&t=36) Microsoft Visual Studio Community Edition.&nbsp; Community Edition is free for individuals,&nbsp;&nbsp;
