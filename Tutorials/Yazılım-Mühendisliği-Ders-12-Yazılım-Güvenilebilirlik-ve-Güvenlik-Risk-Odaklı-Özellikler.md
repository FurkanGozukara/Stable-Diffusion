- [00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=3) Hello everyone,

- [00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=7) welcome to our Software Engineer 12 course. Today's topic is reliability and security features. We've

- [00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=10) reliability and security features. We've combined the topics we've covered here. Risk-

- [00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=14) combined the topics we've covered here. Risk- focused features,

- [00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=15) focused features, security specifications, software

- [00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=18) security specifications, software reliability specifications, and what we

- [00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=21) reliability specifications, and what we call specifications here are security-

- [00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=24) call specifications here are security- related features. Details and similar.

- [00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=28) related features. Details and similar. Yes, reliability requirements

- [00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=31) Yes, reliability requirements

- [00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=39) include error control and recovery capabilities and functional requirements to define protection against system failures. There are requirements that exist, or requirements that don't exist. By "reliability," we mean not meaning it's

- [00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=40) are requirements that exist, or requirements that don't exist. By "reliability," we mean not meaning it's

- [00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=45) useless or useful,

- [00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=47) or useful, meaning it has a function. Is it

- [00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=50) meaning it has a function. Is it passive or not passive?

- [00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=54) passive or not passive? For example, the operating system running a server

- [00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=59) For example, the operating system running a server is a non-functional feature.

- [00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=62) is a non-functional feature. Why? Because, more accurately,

- [00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=65) Why? Because, more accurately,

- [00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=69) let me put it this way. The operating system running a university is a non-functional feature. Why? Because there's no difference in how that website

- [00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=72) feature. Why? Because there's no difference in how that website works, or

- [00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=74) works, or in terms of the functions the website offers to people. It

- [00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=76) in terms of the functions the website offers to people. It

- [00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=81) 's running in the background, but even if it's a non-functional feature, it's a very special and important

- [00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=83) even if it's a non-functional feature, it's a very special and important feature. Sometimes, function

- [00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=86) feature. Sometimes, function is more important than features, or

- [00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=89) is more important than features, or how fast its composition works is

- [00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=91) how fast its composition works is a non-functional but very important

- [00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=93) a non-functional but very important feature. Non-functional requirements that define the system's necessary

- [00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=95) feature. Non-functional requirements that define the system's necessary reliability and usability are

- [00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=97) reliability and usability are

- [00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=101) already mentioned here.

- [00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=104) What is the Turkish term for reliable? The

- [00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=110) conditions and situations that should not arise from the recognized requirement for its reliability and usability are excluded from the recognized requirement. So, here, we

- [00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=113) requirement for its reliability and usability are excluded from the recognized requirement. So, here, we

- [00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=118) know that reliability requirements are listed. We, Kozaklı, have

- [00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=120) Kozaklı, have cooled down the critical system features. This approach should be risk-focused.

- [00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=122) cooled down the critical system features. This approach should be risk-focused. This approach is widely used in safety and security-

- [00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=125) This approach is widely used in safety and security- critical systems. The

- [00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=127) critical systems. The

- [00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=132) purpose of the specific fortune specification process should be to understand the risks faced by the system,

- [00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=134) risks faced by the system, such as safety and security, and to

- [00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=137) such as safety and security, and to identify these risks when necessary.

- [00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=139) identify these risks when necessary. Also, friends,

- [00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=143) Also, friends, what is there between risk and security?

- [00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=146) what is there between risk and security? There is a trade-off. What does this mean?

- [00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=150) There is a trade-off. What does this mean?

- [00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=155) You can't get unlimited security. Why? Because this time we will achieve it. It reduces profitability. That's

- [00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=159) will achieve it. It reduces profitability. That's why a certain balance

- [00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=160) why a certain balance needs to be established. Risk and security.

- [00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=162) needs to be established. Risk and security. Of course,

- [00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=168) Of course, costs increase significantly in systems where human life is involved.

- [00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=171) costs increase significantly in systems where human life is involved. Security needs to increase.

- [00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=173) Security needs to increase. That's why such a risk-focused

- [00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=176) That's why such a risk-focused feature is good. Defining the channel is

- [00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=179) feature is good. Defining the channel is aimed. We are going through the stages of analysis.

- [00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=183) aimed. We are going through the stages of analysis. Disk identification.

- [00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=186) Disk identification. Identify possible risks that may arise. What

- [00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=188) Identify possible risks that may arise. What could happen? What could happen? What could happen?

- [00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=191) could happen? What could happen? What could happen? What could happen?

- [00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=194) What could happen? Everyone uses Facebook at that age. What

- [00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=197) Everyone uses Facebook at that age. What happens sometimes? Facebook's entire business is

- [00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=199) happens sometimes? Facebook's entire business is stolen. What could happen if information

- [00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=201) stolen. What could happen if information is stolen? What could happen to me?

- [00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=203) is stolen? What could happen to me? We will use the message from you. Istanbul İSKİ. We

- [00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=204) We will use the message from you. Istanbul İSKİ. We need to think, for example. Of course,

- [00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=208) need to think, for example. Of course, Facebook's owner. What will he think? Here's

- [00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=210) Facebook's owner. What will he think? Here's this information. What happens if I remove it? Should

- [00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=212) this information. What happens if I remove it? Should

- [00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=217) I take a security measure accordingly for my company? Risk analysis and classification. Assess the severity of each risk.

- [00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=220) classification. Assess the severity of each risk.

- [00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=224) That needs to be assessed and classified. We need to take a position based on the

- [00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=226) needs to be assessed and classified. We need to take a position based on the importance of the risk, the damage it will cause, and

- [00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=230) importance of the risk, the damage it will cause, and the requirements needed to prevent it.

- [00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=232) the requirements needed to prevent it.

- [00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=237) Risk separation separates the old ones to discover potential root causes.

- [00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=239) old ones to discover potential root causes.

- [00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=245) That old reduction assessment. Define how each risk should be

- [00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=247) how each risk should be eliminated or reduced when designing a risk-focused system.

- [00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=248) eliminated or reduced when designing a risk-focused system.

- [00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=255) Yes, let's see what the risk is for Aydan Turkey, that is, the identification of risk,

- [00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=260) for Aydan Turkey, that is, the identification of risk, the definition of risk for riscript.

- [00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=263) the definition of risk for riscript. After that, comes the old analysis.

- [00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=265) After that, comes the old analysis. Risk analysis, then the old

- [00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=268) Risk analysis, then the old assessment, the valuation. Here's

- [00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=448) it, and there's hardware. This is a system that should be truly safe. Why?

- [00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=450) a system that should be truly safe. Why? Because it can cause human death and health damage.

- [00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=454) Because it can cause human death and health damage. Now, look at

- [00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=457) Now, look at the risks here, one by one. We

- [00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=459) the risks here, one by one. We

- [00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=464) need to take precautions against all of them. When can insulin over-friendly occur? Service failure, that is, if the internal

- [00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=467) occur? Service failure, that is, if the internal software overdoses

- [00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=469) software overdoses and service failures lead to a risk of

- [00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=473) and service failures lead to a risk of underdosing. Again, service failure, again, software failure. A

- [00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=476) underdosing. Again, service failure, again, software failure. A dead battery. Power outage due to electricity.

- [00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=497) this the device that probably performs the insulin injection process?

- [00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=501) the device that probably performs the insulin injection process? Yes, it flows, or an

- [00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=504) Yes, it flows, or an actuator. It's

- [00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=506) actuator. It's a type of motor that controls and moves the system. Stop, it's

- [00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=509) a type of motor that controls and moves the system. Stop, it's powered by an energy source.

- [00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=510) powered by an energy source. This source is electricity. Fluid

- [00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=513) This source is electricity. Fluid pressure or pneumatic is simple, and some of

- [00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=515) pressure or pneumatic is simple, and some of its rackets are converted into energy. So,

- [00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=520) its rackets are converted into energy. So, what is it? If the sensor is weak,

- [00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=525) what is it? If the sensor is weak, we can't judge what happens. If there's

- [00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=527) we can't judge what happens. If there's damage, what happens? The pump won't work properly, not

- [00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=530) damage, what happens? The pump won't work properly, not enough people are pumping, and similarly, what is

- [00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=535) enough people are pumping, and similarly, what is this? This is physical damage.

- [00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=539) this? This is physical damage. Parts of the machine break in the body.

- [00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=542) Parts of the machine break in the body. What? If you are doing something, here is a movement.

- [00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=544) What? If you are doing something, here is a movement. This is physical damage. This is

- [00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=547) This is physical damage. This is

- [00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=551) infection caused by the entrance of the machine. Look, this is biological damage.

- [00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=552) damage. There are different types of damage. We will know all of them. We

- [00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=554) There are different types of damage. We will know all of them. We

- [00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=561) need to calculate them all and take as many precautions as possible. This is where this happens. Why? Because it

- [00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=563) this happens. Why? Because it needs to go under the skin so that you can

- [00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=565) needs to go under the skin so that you can inject insulin into the body with a needle.

- [00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=568) inject insulin into the body with a needle. What

- [00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=571) What can happen at the entrance? An infection can occur. You. This is a

- [00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=574) can happen at the entrance? An infection can occur. You. This is a biological risk.

- [00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=577) biological risk. Allergic reaction to materials or insulin. What is this? This is a

- [00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=579) Allergic reaction to materials or insulin. What is this? This is a biological disk again. Yes, hazard

- [00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=583) biological disk again. Yes, hazard assessment. Now, what do we do?

- [00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=585) assessment. Now, what do we do? We have done the risks. We

- [00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=588) We have done the risks. We have written down the FIFA deck rays. Now

- [00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=592) have written down the FIFA deck rays. Now we will evaluate the hazard. The process is about understanding the probability of a risk

- [00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=594) we will evaluate the hazard. The process is about understanding the probability of a risk occurring and the possible consequences that could

- [00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=596) occurring and the possible consequences that could arise in the event of an accident or incident.

- [00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=598) arise in the event of an accident or incident.

- [00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=603) So, look, what are we analyzing? We

- [00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=610) are analyzing both the probability of occurrence and what would happen if it did occur. We are evaluating the risks as follows.

- [00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=612) We are evaluating the risks as follows. Unbearable.

- [00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=615) Unbearable. In other words, this risk occurring is

- [00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=618) In other words, this risk occurring is unacceptable. It should never occur. It

- [00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=621) unacceptable. It should never occur. It

- [00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=626) should never occur or cause an accident. We will do our best to minimize these types of risks.

- [00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=628) We will do our best to minimize these types of risks.

- [00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=635) A L R P. What does this mean? Let's look at the English version right away. Gezi numbered is stuck.

- [00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=644) look at the English version right away. Gezi numbered is stuck. So let's say m o p o Okade Yes,

- [00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=651) So let's say m o p o Okade Yes, friends, considering the practicality of the low

- [00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=654) friends, considering the practicality of the low cost and program constraints, the

- [00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=656) cost and program constraints, the probability of risk should be

- [00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=659) probability of risk should be minimized. So, if this risk

- [00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=665) minimized. So, if this risk occurs, we

- [00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=667) occurs, we can accept it. But why? We minimize it as much as

- [00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=670) can accept it. But why? We minimize it as much as possible.

- [00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=672) possible. So, the probability of this risk occurring is

- [00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=674) So, the probability of this risk occurring is reasonably high, and what is

- [00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=677) reasonably high, and what is acceptable is acceptable. The consequences of the disk are

- [00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=679) acceptable is acceptable. The consequences of the disk are acceptable, and

- [00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=681) acceptable, and no extra costs should be incurred to reduce the probability of danger.

- [00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=683) no extra costs should be incurred to reduce the probability of danger. Why? Because the

- [00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=686) Why? Because the damage I will suffer when it occurs is less than the resources we

- [00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=688) damage I will suffer when it occurs is less than the resources we will spend to prevent that risk.

- [00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=691) will spend to prevent that risk. For example,

- [00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=696) For example, if we suffer a very small loss in a power outage, we

- [00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=699) if we suffer a very small loss in a power outage, we

- [00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=706) may not go and buy a noodle power supply that will cause more damage. For example, what is involved in the maintenance of the risk triangle?

- [00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=712) what is involved in the maintenance of the risk triangle? Acceptable for it to find Diss to tolerate throwing it at itself.

- [00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=714) Acceptable for it to find Diss to tolerate throwing it at itself. Actually, this is an inverted three-sided

- [00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=718) Actually, this is an inverted three-sided pyramid. Why? Because the highest area. That is, it

- [00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=721) pyramid. Why? Because the highest area. That is, it creates the area of ​​ greatest impact of risk.

- [00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=724) creates the area of ​​greatest impact of risk. Unacceptable errors are at the top.

- [00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=727) Unacceptable errors are at the top. What is there next? Risk toilet tone. The first

- [00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=730) What is there next? Risk toilet tone. The first result is plastic. Chlorine is

- [00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=733) result is plastic. Chlorine is excessively expand. So,

- [00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=737) excessively expand. So, we reduce the risk as much as possible, but

- [00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=741) we reduce the risk as much as possible, but when we reduce it below that, preventing that risk

- [00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=747) when we reduce it below that, preventing that risk is no longer sustainable.

- [00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=749) is no longer sustainable. For example, it far exceeds your cost and

- [00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=751) For example, it far exceeds your cost and becomes more costly than the device, of course.

- [00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=753) becomes more costly than the device, of course. So, what happens if we lose money?

- [00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=755) So, what happens if we lose money? We cannot produce a device, but

- [00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=758) We cannot produce a device, but we can do it in the toilet. So, consider that. We can take it

- [00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=761) we can do it in the toilet. So, consider that. We can take it if you don't want it, there are also when using medication. It's

- [00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=763) if you don't want it, there are also when using medication. It's always like this in the prospectus. The author is 1/1

- [00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=766) always like this in the prospectus. The author is 1/1 and there are many, many dangerous things,

- [00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=770) and there are many, many dangerous things, but what do we do because the risk is very low

- [00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=772) but what do we do because the risk is very low and the benefit is very high, we

- [00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=773) and the benefit is very high, we take that risk. I mean, I mean, I

- [00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=777) take that risk. I mean, I mean, I happened to a car, it

- [00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=780) happened to a car, it happened to that person, in the end, I

- [00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=782) happened to that person, in the end, I mean, death could happen, God forbid, or

- [00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=784) mean, death could happen, God forbid, or disability could happen, etc., but

- [00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=793) because fasting is low and it will benefit us a lot in the game, we take that old one, think about it, call me at 6 Access The Bridge

- [00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=796) think about it, call me at 6 Access The Bridge in netglobal, so we can ignore

- [00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=799) in netglobal, so we can ignore it, what happens? For example,

- [00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=800) it, what happens? For example, you take medication, it causes stomach aches,

- [00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=803) you take medication, it causes stomach aches, it causes joint pain, it causes fever,

- [00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=807) it causes joint pain, it causes fever, and so on. We

- [00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=810) and so on. We can tolerate it, we can miss it.

- [00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=812) can tolerate it, we can miss it. Yes, the social

- [00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=816) Yes, the social acceptability of a risk

- [00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=819) acceptability of a risk

- [00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=824) is determined by human, social, and political considerations. As you know, here, we determine whether the

- [00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=828) As you know, here, we determine whether the

- [00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=834) risk is accepted by the combination of these three different things.

- [00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=839) In many societies, the boundaries between regions are raised over time, meaning the collective is

- [00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=842) are raised over time, meaning the collective is less willing to accept it. For

- [00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=849) example, the cost of cleaning up pollution

- [00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=854) may be less than the cost of preventing it, but this may not be socially acceptable. So,

- [00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=857) may not be socially acceptable. So, even if society knows this, it may not accept it

- [00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=859) even if society knows this, it may not accept it and say For example,

- [00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=866) don't clean it, brother. Risk assessment is subjective, meaning it varies from person to person.

- [00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=869) is subjective, meaning it varies from person to person. 3D Nascar

- [00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=872) 3D Nascar is defined as possible, unlikely, etc. This assessment

- [00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=875) is defined as possible, unlikely, etc. This assessment depends on who is doing it. Yes, this is also an important

- [00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=878) depends on who is doing it. Yes, this is also an important element. How likely is the risk of burya?

- [00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=882) element. How likely is the risk of burya? For example, it should be 1/100,000. Of course, there are

- [00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=884) For example, it should be 1/100,000. Of course, there are

- [00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=891) systems developed for these. What can we say? There are rules. But ultimately, when Nihal

- [00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=895) There are rules. But ultimately, when Nihal decides, the risk assessment depends on the

- [00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=898) decides, the risk assessment depends on the

- [00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=904) probability of risk and the severity of the risk. Estimate the probability of risk and the severity of the risk. What is the percentage of the risk,

- [00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=907) risk. What is the percentage of the risk, the prevalence, etc., and this

- [00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=909) the prevalence, etc., and this risk, and in what range, is it completely unacceptable? Is it

- [00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=913) risk, and in what range, is it completely unacceptable? Is it reasonably

- [00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=916) reasonably acceptable or directly acceptable?

- [00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=918) acceptable or directly acceptable? Normally, it

- [00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=920) Normally, it is not possible to do this exactly. Therefore, it

- [00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=923) is not possible to do this exactly. Therefore, it is unlikely, rare, very high.

- [00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=926) is unlikely, rare, very high. We use relative values. The goal

- [00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=929) We use relative values. The goal

- [00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=934) should be to exclude the risk that is likely to occur or that has high severity. For us, this is to find the most critical risks and

- [00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=938) For us, this is to find the most critical risks and eliminate them. Our goal is to eliminate them.

- [00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=941) eliminate them. Our goal is to eliminate them. Look, the insulin pump

- [00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=945) Look, the insulin pump classification is made as follows. The

- [00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=947) classification is made as follows. The defined danger is insulin overdose

- [00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=950) defined danger is insulin overdose calculation. If an overdose calculation

- [00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=951) calculation. If an overdose calculation is made, what would happen? Look at the hazard room. The

- [00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=955) is made, what would happen? Look at the hazard room. The accident

- [00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=958) accident severity is high. If an accident occurs,

- [00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=962) severity is high. If an accident occurs, it could cause very serious damage.

- [00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=964) it could cause very serious damage. We estimate high acceptability.

- [00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=967) We estimate high acceptability. So, never. Insulin pump

- [00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=971) So, never. Insulin pump overdose calculation should be done. Why? Because it's

- [00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=972) overdose calculation should be done. Why? Because it's

- [00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=981) an insulin underdose calculation that could possibly kill or incapacitate someone.

- [00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=985) Here, in the danger room, there's still an environment, but the accident severity is low. Why? Because when you

- [00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=988) but the accident severity is low. Why? Because when you submit the file, the patient

- [00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=991) submit the file, the patient doesn't die immediately or

- [00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=993) doesn't die immediately or doesn't cause serious damage. For example, in this case, the patient's blood sugar may drop. For example, they

- [00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=996) doesn't cause serious damage. For example, in this case, the patient's blood sugar may drop. For example, they might get upset,

- [00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=998) might get upset, faint, I don't know the exact

- [00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1000) faint, I don't know the exact estimated risk. That's why it's low, so it's

- [00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1003) estimated risk. That's why it's low, so it's acceptable. So, which of these two risks

- [00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1007) acceptable. So, which of these two risks will we eliminate? Which one will we

- [00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1008) will we eliminate? Which one will we try to eliminate? Of course, as an

- [00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1011) try to eliminate? Of course, as an overfriendly calculation, this hardware monitoring

- [00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1013) overfriendly calculation, this hardware monitoring system malfunction is moderately dangerous,

- [00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1016) system malfunction is moderately dangerous, but the common accident severity common estimated

- [00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1019) but the common accident severity common estimated risk is low. How

- [00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1022) risk is low. How acceptable is the Michael level? Let's change the e a l a r p year

- [00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1027) acceptable is the Michael level? Let's change the e a l a r p year as we wrote.

- [00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1031) as we wrote. As low as reasonably practical. Yes, a

- [00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1039) As low as reasonably practical. Yes, a power outage, meaning what happens if the battery dies

- [00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1042) power outage, meaning what happens if the battery dies ? What would happen if the

- [00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1043) ? What would happen if the accident severity is low? A

- [00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1046) accident severity is low? A low acceptable one.

- [00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1051) low acceptable one. So, here in the danger room, muscle strain.

- [00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1054) So, here in the danger room, muscle strain. What probability could this happen? The

- [00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1058) What probability could this happen? The battery dies with a high probability.

- [00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1059) battery dies with a high probability. But even

- [00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1062) But even if it's profitable, and your estimates are

- [00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1064) if it's profitable, and your estimates are low, what does this look like? It's

- [00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1068) low, what does this look like? It's similar to an insulin underfriendly calculation. Why?

- [00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1070) similar to an insulin underfriendly calculation. Why? Because then, if it gives a low fresh, if

- [00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1073) Because then, if it gives a low fresh, if the power goes out, we won't give them any work.

- [00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1075) the power goes out, we won't give them any work. This machine is incorrectly installed, see. This is

- [00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1078) This machine is incorrectly installed, see. This is dangerous. It's actually high, so it's very It's

- [00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1080) dangerous. It's actually high, so it's very It's a mistake that can be made. The severity of the accident

- [00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1083) a mistake that can be made. The severity of the accident is also high if it's installed incorrectly, and the estimated

- [00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1086) is also high if it's installed incorrectly, and the estimated risk is high. That's why it's unpredictable. The

- [00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1088) risk is high. That's why it's unpredictable. The

- [00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1094) machine should be designed to allow for incorrect installation. This disease's machine breakage has been examined. The

- [00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1096) This disease's machine breakage has been examined. The risk is low, meaning it's very rare for the

- [00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1098) risk is low, meaning it's very rare for the insulin

- [00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1100) insulin pump system to break. However, the accident

- [00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1103) pump system to break. However, the accident is high. If it does happen,

- [00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1106) is high. If it does happen, it could harm the patient. The estimated risk is medium. So,

- [00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1110) it could harm the patient. The estimated risk is medium. So, what happens?

- [00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1113) what happens? Why is it acceptable at a reasonable level? Because,

- [00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1114) Why is it acceptable at a reasonable level? Because, look, this rate is low, because the probability of danger is

- [00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1119) look, this rate is low, because the probability of danger is low, because

- [00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1121) low, because this ethamine injection is medium,

- [00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1124) this ethamine injection is medium, I'll look at something in English here. Hazard

- [00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1128) I'll look at something in English here. Hazard probability, that is, the danger is likely.

- [00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1130) probability, that is, the danger is likely. I like the opposite. The severity of the accident is correct. The

- [00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1134) I like the opposite. The severity of the accident is correct. The prediction is correct. All are correct. Yes,

- [00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1141) prediction is correct. All are correct. Yes, the machine causes infection in the patient.

- [00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1144) the machine causes infection in the patient. How did it come about? The severity of the accident is

- [00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1147) How did it come about? The severity of the accident is averaged. The prediction is discord.

- [00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1149) averaged. The prediction is discord. This is also a reasonable level of electrical

- [00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1155) This is also a reasonable level of electrical interference.

- [00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1158) interference. This isn't development here, but the internet

- [00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1162) This isn't development here, but the internet wanted money. Electrical. What should we call it? We

- [00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1165) wanted money. Electrical. What should we call it? We weren't talking about interaction before, I guess we weren't there. Let's call it interference.

- [00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1176) Yes, let's call it more money. Look, the probability of this happening

- [00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1180) Look, the probability of this happening is low,

- [00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1182) is low, and that profit is high, and the estimated risk is

- [00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1186) and that profit is high, and the estimated risk is medium. That's why this is damalka. It's allergic. The reaction is

- [00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1191) medium. That's why this is damalka. It's allergic. The reaction is low, most people have an allergic reaction. A

- [00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1194) low, most people have an allergic reaction. A very few people have it. The severity of the accident is low.

- [00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1197) very few people have it. The severity of the accident is low. It can be treated. I guess

- [00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1200) It can be treated. I guess it's tight, so it's acceptable,

- [00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1206) it's tight, so it's acceptable, but there are some medications that the

- [00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1209) but there are some medications that the eye can't detect, for example, allergies to the penis. Because it

- [00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1212) eye can't detect, for example, allergies to the penis. Because it can kill people in a very short time. So,

- [00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1213) can kill people in a very short time. So,

- [00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1218) what do we do when we get a penicillin-derived drug? You need to establish a fully equipped facility or at least a facility that can intervene immediately in the event of an allergic reaction.

- [00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1220) or at least a facility that can intervene immediately in the event of an allergic reaction.

- [00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1228) For example, in a hospital, at home, outside of a hospital. Why shouldn't it be done?

- [00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1232) home, outside of a hospital. Why shouldn't it be done? Because right away, if you

- [00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1234) Because right away, if you say you're allergic, you

- [00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1236) say you're allergic, you need to be taken to the hospital immediately. Like this.

- [00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1239) need to be taken to the hospital immediately. Like this. Yes, hazard analysis is

- [00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1242) Yes, hazard analysis is a system development. Gene

- [00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1244) a system development. Gene deals with discovering the root causes.

- [00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1247) deals with discovering the root causes. Analysis of a hazard. Threats are mostly

- [00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1251) Analysis of a hazard. Threats are mostly

- [00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1256) derived from safety-critical systems. There's inductive, for example. Bottom-up techniques.

- [00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1277) determine the possible causes.

- [00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1283) Yes, in one case, we start with a failure and evaluate the hazards that may arise from the throat.

- [00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1284) hazards that may arise from the throat. In the other, we

- [00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1301) a deductive top-down technique. Put it at the root of the tree. So, A is at the

- [00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1304) Put it at the root of the tree. So, A is at the top. Now, when we say Tree,

- [00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1308) top. Now, when we say Tree, what happens in Jetta computer language tree notation? It

- [00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1311) what happens in Jetta computer language tree notation? It starts from the root at the top and

- [00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1314) starts from the root at the top and works its way down. Think about it that way,

- [00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1323) when appropriate, these and or conditions should be related to the

- [00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1326) conditions should be related to the target system failure. The target system failure

- [00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1329) target system failure. The target system failure

- [00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1335) should be to minimize the number of Tekin reasons in maintenance. That is, when an error occurs in a single thing.

- [00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1336) That is, when an error occurs in a single thing. If a failure occurs, sometimes

- [00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1339) If a failure occurs, sometimes several failures occur in the realization of the probability.

- [00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1341) several failures occur in the realization of the probability. It is more difficult, rare, and

- [00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1345) It is more difficult, rare, and more important. They said it belongs to the first two.

- [00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1349) more important. They said it belongs to the first two. What do we do? We clone. If one

- [00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1352) What do we do? We clone. If one tooth breaks down, the other one

- [00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1354) tooth breaks down, the other one remains intact.

- [00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1356) remains intact. What can we do immediately by changing it?

- [00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1360) What can we do immediately by changing it? Yes, we can continue here. For example,

- [00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1363) Yes, we can continue here. For example, what is required for the failure to occur? At least two

- [00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1366) what is required for the failure to occur? At least two disks must fail simultaneously.

- [00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1367) disks must fail simultaneously. Tekir is not the reason.

- [00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1369) Tekir is not the reason. If there are three disks, it is the reason for the triple error. Let's

- [00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1374) If there are three disks, it is the reason for the triple error. Let's write an example of the error. What

- [00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1377) write an example of the error. What is there, for example, incorrect dose.

- [00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1380) is there, for example, incorrect dose. So, when an incorrect insulin

- [00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1384) So, when an incorrect insulin dose is administered to the patient,

- [00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1388) dose is administered to the patient, look here. What is there, there is a gate there.

- [00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1391) look here. What is there, there is a gate there. Oryan i or. When any of these

- [00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1394) Oryan i or. When any of these occur,

- [00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1397) occur, this event can occur. Now,

- [00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1401) this event can occur. Now, I will explain the following events. This is the

- [00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1403) I will explain the following events. This is the gate or gate. First, look at the

- [00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1405) gate or gate. First, look at the sugar level in the patient's blood. If the patient has a blood sugar level, it must be triple. If we

- [00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1408) sugar level in the patient's blood. If the patient has a blood sugar level, it must be triple. If we measure the blood level incorrectly,

- [00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1411) measure the blood level incorrectly, what happens? We give the wrong thing.

- [00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1414) what happens? We give the wrong thing. Naturally, another situation is if

- [00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1418) Naturally, another situation is if

- [00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1423) this file is given at the wrong time, like the Korean doses, the runtime. We calculated it correctly, but we

- [00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1426) calculated it correctly, but we calculated the time of administration incorrectly. Or,

- [00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1428) calculated the time of administration incorrectly. Or, now I calculated it should be given immediately, but the machine

- [00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1430) now I calculated it should be given immediately, but the machine went and gave it an hour later. So,

- [00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1432) went and gave it an hour later. So, what happens then? This is again an incorrect

- [00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1436) what happens then? This is again an incorrect friend.

- [00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1440) friend. Look, or

- [00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1442) Look, or what happens when any of these happen? The

- [00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1445) what happens when any of these happen? The wrong insulin dose is given to the patient. 3D

- [00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1449) wrong insulin dose is given to the patient. 3D WD Live systemfehler, meaning

- [00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1452) WD Live systemfehler, meaning they will inject the patient.

- [00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1454) they will inject the patient. What happens if there is an error in the injection system? It either gives too little, or too much, or

- [00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1457) What happens if there is an error in the injection system? It either gives too little, or too much, or not at all. This again causes an incorrect

- [00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1460) not at all. This again causes an incorrect insulin dose to be given.

- [00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1463) insulin dose to be given. Look, these also act on themselves below.

- [00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1466) Look, these also act on themselves below. For example, in what situations does an incorrect blood sugar

- [00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1470) For example, in what situations does an incorrect blood sugar level calculation

- [00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1472) level calculation occur? For example, it occurs when the sensor malfunctions,

- [00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1476) occur? For example, it occurs when the sensor malfunctions,

- [00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1483) or, thank God for the Computer, Ertuğrul, there is a sugar calculation error,

- [00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1485) calculation error, sugar attack sugar error calculation. So,

- [00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1488) sugar attack sugar error calculation. So, in what situations does this happen? If

- [00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1490) in what situations does this happen? If there is an error in this algorithm, then it

- [00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1492) there is an error in this algorithm, then it occurs. Or, numerical, even

- [00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1496) occurs. Or, numerical, even mathematical operation errors,

- [00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1497) mathematical operation errors, arithmetic houses. Now

- [00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1501) arithmetic houses. Now let's look at our second situation. So,

- [00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1506) let's look at our second situation. So,

- [00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1512) when the correct file is injected at the wrong time. No, when can this happen? This is more of a timing error. It

- [00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1515) can this happen? This is more of a timing error. It can also happen that we3 error is the

- [00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1519) can also happen that we3 error is the cheese in the delivered system. So what happens to the

- [00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1522) cheese in the delivered system. So what happens to the success of the system that injects the patient?

- [00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1524) success of the system that injects the patient? This also happens in two cases and in

- [00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1527) This also happens in two cases and in oily cases.

- [00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1530) oily cases.

- [00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1535) This error can occur when the pump signals are faulty. Another situation is

- [00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1538) Another situation is insulin or complete Jin denial. So, the person's error can occur. If

- [00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1542) insulin or complete Jin denial. So, the person's error can occur. If the calculation is incorrect, it could be years.

- [00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1545) the calculation is incorrect, it could be years. You're very good at it. When can the main error in the calculation

- [00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1548) You're very good at it. When can the main error in the calculation occur?

- [00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1550) occur? This is on Algöz's table or arithmetic error,

- [00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1553) This is on Algöz's table or arithmetic error, meaning a mathematical operation error.

- [00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1562) meaning a mathematical operation error. Yes, now, friends, we've

- [00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1574) Yes, now, friends, we've analyzed the error tree here. We've also included it as a text.

- [00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1578) analyzed the error tree here. We've also included it as a text.

- [00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1584) You can't give the wrong insulin dose. There are three possible situations that could lead to error tree analysis. Incorrect blood sugar

- [00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1586) three possible situations that could lead to error tree analysis. Incorrect blood sugar level measurement. Delivery

- [00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1588) level measurement. Delivery system failure. Injecting insulin into the body during a friendly delivery at the wrong time. The

- [00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1590) system failure. Injecting insulin into the body during a friendly delivery at the wrong time. The

- [00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1601) main causes of these software-related hazards are: algorithm error, arithmetic error, Ata, meaning

- [00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1605) error, arithmetic error, Ata, meaning if you make a mistake while calculating numbers, it

- [00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1606) if you make a mistake while calculating numbers, it becomes an arithmetic error in programming.

- [00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1610) becomes an arithmetic error in programming. That's what it's like, here's an example.

- [00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1612) That's what it's like, here's an example. You might say "experience," but if you treat it like a drum, it's like an

- [00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1615) You might say "experience," but if you treat it like a drum, it's like an integer, or if

- [00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1618) integer, or if you treat it like an Atasay, it

- [00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1620) you treat it like an Atasay, it could be an error. Risk reduction. So, how do we reduce risk? The

- [00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1623) could be an error. Risk reduction. So, how do we reduce risk? The purpose of this process is to

- [00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1627) purpose of this process is to determine how risk should be managed

- [00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1629) determine how risk should be managed and to ensure that accidents and incidents

- [00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1632) and to ensure that accidents and incidents don't occur.

- [00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1634) don't occur.

- [00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1640) Risk reduction strategies include risk avoidance, risk detection and

- [00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1645) risk avoidance, risk detection and elimination, and damage limitation.

- [00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1656) Normal use of risk reduction strategies. Normally,

- [00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1661) a mix of risk reduction strategies is used in critical systems. So, we

- [00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1663) So, we use a mixture of all three. In a chemical radio control

- [00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1666) use a mixture of all three. In a chemical radio control system, look at this chemical test system. Okay, it

- [00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1670) system, look at this chemical test system. Okay, it

- [00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1674) will naturally contain sensors to detect and correct overpressure. However, here he

- [00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1677) However, here he said chemical, but daddy, please look to

- [00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1690) said chemical, but daddy, please look to the right. Kemal Kaplan

- [00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1693) the right. Kemal Kaplan

- [00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1700) also has an independent protection system that opens a relief valve when dangerously high pressure is detected. Look,

- [00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1704) Look, there's an additional system here that's completely independent of that system. So,

- [00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1709) there's an additional system here that's completely independent of that system. So, where does the pressure build up? It's in the reactor. Let's

- [00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1712) where does the pressure build up? It's in the reactor. Let's see a little bit about our Turkey. Is that right?

- [00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1714) see a little bit about our Turkey. Is that right? Yes, that's right. Go here and there.

- [00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1717) Yes, that's right. Go here and there. There are three other independent systems. They're completely unrelated.

- [00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1719) There are three other independent systems. They're completely unrelated.

- [00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1726) They open the relief valve. This way, they can monitor each other.

- [00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1730) they can monitor each other. Yes, the insulin pump has written risks.

- [00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1732) Yes, the insulin pump has written risks. Arithmetic error can cause a calculation to

- [00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1735) Arithmetic error can cause a calculation to overflow the value of a variable. This

- [00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1738) overflow the value of a variable. This could be overflow or

- [00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1740) could be overflow or insufficient. Maybe every arithmetic

- [00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1743) insufficient. Maybe every arithmetic error can include an exception handler in the process.

- [00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1745) error can include an exception handler in the process. Algorithmic. Even

- [00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1748) Algorithmic. Even the algorithm is what

- [00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1750) the algorithm is what software developers do. Compare the dose to be given

- [00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1753) software developers do. Compare the dose to be given with the previous dose or safety

- [00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1755) with the previous dose or safety maximum doses. Take a low

- [00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1757) maximum doses. Take a low dose too high. If it's too high, reduce the dose.

- [00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1759) dose too high. If it's too high, reduce the dose. So, here are the algorithmic

- [00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1763) So, here are the algorithmic and arithmetic measures you

- [00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1764) and arithmetic measures you need to add from the control.

- [00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1768) need to add from the control. Examples of safety requirements. SR11 is the

- [00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1773) Examples of safety requirements. SR11 is the

- [00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1781) only system where the maximum dose specified for a system user is greater than the specified maximum dose. A friend won't give a herd. So, no matter what arithmetic value we

- [00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1784) So, no matter what arithmetic value we calculate, it's not an algorithm. No

- [00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1786) calculate, it's not an algorithm. No matter what we calculate, what

- [00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1789) matter what we calculate, what will we do? We will set a maximum letter limit,

- [00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1792) will we do? We will set a maximum letter limit, and the system will never

- [00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1795) and the system will never give a dose greater than this. Two systems will not give

- [00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1800) give a dose greater than this. Two systems will not give

- [00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1806) a cumulative daily insulin dose that is less than the specified maximum daily dose for a system user. What is this?

- [00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1809) What is this? Our system

- [00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1810) Our system doesn't give more than the maximum dose at a time, but

- [00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1813) doesn't give more than the maximum dose at a time, but we collect the doses given throughout the day

- [00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1816) we collect the doses given throughout the day and look at the daily maximum dose if it exceeds that

- [00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1819) and look at the daily maximum dose if it exceeds that again. After that, it won't give more.

- [00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1822) again. After that, it won't give more. We will cut it off. 13. The system will be run at least four times an hour

- [00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1828) We will cut it off. 13. The system will be run at least four times an hour

- [00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1833) until a hardware diagnosis is made. That is, at least, and the hardware will be

- [00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1839) and the hardware will be analyzed and diagnosed hourly. So, here's the

- [00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1843) analyzed and diagnosed hourly. So, here's the hardware. What should we call hardware control? It would

- [00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1845) hardware. What should we call hardware control? It would even be better if we called control verification.

- [00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1852) even be better if we called control verification. Yes, the system table should

- [00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1855) Yes, the system table should

- [00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1860) contain an exception handler for all Muslims defined here. The table is processed. But of course, this is completely true. A

- [00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1862) table is processed. But of course, this is completely true. A table in the book. 5. If any

- [00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1867) table in the book. 5. If any hardware and software abnormality

- [00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1870) hardware and software abnormality is detected, an audible alarm will sound, and a

- [00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1872) is detected, an audible alarm will sound, and a diagnostic message will be displayed as complete in the table.

- [00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1874) diagnostic message will be displayed as complete in the table. What is the diagnosis here? This

- [00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1876) What is the diagnosis here? This will indicate the malfunction. What

- [00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1879) will indicate the malfunction. What is the alarm? It's important because this

- [00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1881) is the alarm? It's important because this way, patient B

- [00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1886) way, patient B will easily understand that there is a malfunction. 61

- [00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1889) will easily understand that there is a malfunction. 61 is in the alarm state. Until the user resets the system and

- [00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1891) is in the alarm state. Until the user resets the system and clears the alarm, insulin

- [00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1893) clears the alarm, insulin will be suspended. This means that

- [00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1898) will be suspended. This means that when the alarm occurs, the system will

- [00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1900) when the alarm occurs, the system will stop delivering insulin. The user will then

- [00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1902) stop delivering insulin. The user will then restart the system and follow up until the error is resolved.

- [00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1904) restart the system and follow up until the error is resolved. Anyway, I didn't like the key

- [00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1908) Anyway, I didn't like the key points. A risk analysis is an important activity in determining safety and

- [00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1910) points. A risk analysis is an important activity in determining safety and reliability requirements. It

- [00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1912) reliability requirements. It

- [00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1921) involves identifying risks that could cause accidents or incidents.

- [00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1925) A hazard-focused approach can be used to understand the safety requirements of a system. You can identify potential hazards

- [00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1928) can be used to understand the safety requirements of a system. You can identify potential hazards and isolate

- [00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1930) and isolate them using methods such as error detection to identify root causes. To

- [00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1932) them using methods such as error detection to identify root causes. To

- [00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1938) prevent hazards and accidents, or if this is impossible,

- [00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1942) or if this is impossible, to limit the damage caused by system failure, safety

- [00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1944) to limit the damage caused by system failure, safety requirements should

- [00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1946) requirements should be included according to safety requirements. Yes, that's how it is. 12

- [00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1958) But now, system reliability is a measurable system

- [00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1962) a measurable system feature. It can be measured. Therefore,

- [00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1965) feature. It can be measured. Therefore, non-functional reliability

- [00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1967) non-functional reliability requirements can

- [00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1968) requirements can be quantified. If you want to see what was

- [00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1971) be quantified. If you want to see what was functional, it's not useless.

- [00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1974) functional, it's not useless. These define the acceptable number of failures during normal system use

- [00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1976) These define the acceptable number of failures during normal system use

- [00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1981) or the time the system should be present. For

- [00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1989) example, if the system has at most one failure per year, it should be present. For example, it

- [00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1995) should be operational for 23 hours and 55 minutes per day. Functional reliability requirements are

- [00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=1998) Functional reliability requirements are mock-ups. We've passed the year. Now, we

- [00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=2000) mock-ups. We've passed the year. Now, we

- [00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=2007) define the system and software processes that prevent, detect, or tolerate errors in software. Thus, this is the system and software processes that prevent, detect, or tolerate errors.

- [00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=2013) For example, if you want to give insulin, which is a reliability

- [00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=2016) want to give insulin, which is a reliability error, it's because

- [00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=2018) error, it's because injecting it is already

- [00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=2021) injecting it is already a functional feature of the system.

- [00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=2024) a functional feature of the system.

- [00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=2029) Software reliability requirements can also be

- [00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=2031) reliability requirements can also be included to cope with hardware or operator error. A reliability specification

- [00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=2035) included to cope with hardware or operator error. A reliability specification process begins with risk identification.

- [00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=2037) process begins with risk identification.

- [00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=2042) Identify the types of system failures that can lead to economic losses. Which failures lead to economic losses? For

- [00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=2045) failures lead to economic losses? For example, Yusuf: Is there an economic loss in the system?

- [00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=2048) example, Yusuf: Is there an economic loss in the system? Normally, if you

- [00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=2052) Normally, if you provide a warranty, if there's a situation that

- [00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=2054) provide a warranty, if there's a situation that could cause failure during the warranty period,

- [00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=2057) could cause failure during the warranty period, preventing it

- [00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=2059) preventing it can certainly lead to some caution. Because the

- [00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=2061) can certainly lead to some caution. Because the product comes with a lower warranty, but

- [00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=2062) product comes with a lower warranty, but other than that, there's no other way. But what's there? Health risks,

- [00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=2067) other than that, there's no other way. But what's there? Health risks, environmental risks, and more important risk

- [00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=2071) environmental risks, and more important risk analysis. Apps estimate

- [00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=2073) analysis. Apps estimate the costs and consequences of different types of software failures.

- [00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=2075) the costs and consequences of different types of software failures. Now, when a patient

- [00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=2077) Now, when a patient dies, what happened this time?

- [00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=2078) dies, what happened this time? If you do this, what happens in the table?

- [00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=2081) If you do this, what happens in the table? A very serious economic coffee will be reached.

- [00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=2082) A very serious economic coffee will be reached. If we think so,

- [00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=2086) If we think so, identify the root causes of system failure,

- [00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=2098) including quantitative requirements that define acceptable risk reduction levels. Create reliable reliability specifications, including

- [00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=2101) reliable reliability specifications, including system failure types,

- [00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=2107) system failure types, failure version description, service

- [00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=2110) failure version description, service loss, failure type, system

- [00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=2113) loss, failure type, system unavailability or service failure, and

- [00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=2115) unavailability or service failure, and the mother is now very

- [00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=2117) the mother is now very famous. Let me give an example: what's

- [00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=2119) famous. Let me give an example: what's cryptocurrency? There are exchanges, cryptocurrency

- [00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=2123) cryptocurrency? There are exchanges, cryptocurrency exchanges, for example. For example,

- [00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=2125) exchanges, for example. For example, what happens when people make large sales? They immediately

- [00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=2127) what happens when people make large sales? They immediately close their transactions because they

- [00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=2129) close their transactions because they can't cover that sale. There needs to be a very rapid outflow of money.

- [00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=2131) can't cover that sale. There needs to be a very rapid outflow of money. What is this, this

- [00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=2135) servant? Meanwhile, the stock market monetary system is currently experiencing a significant positive decline. 370% is a significant

- [00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=2137) monetary system is currently experiencing a significant positive decline. 370% is a significant positive. That

- [00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=2145) recommend you never enter. When the consequences of a failure in non-critical services are

- [00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=2150) less than the consequences of a critical service failure, you

- [00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=2159) can separate this into the loss of critical services and the loss of non-critical services. We are at fault. The system is

- [00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=2162) The system is providing the correct service to users. The correct service is not provided.

- [00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=2165) providing the correct service to users. The correct service is not provided. Again, this credit criticality can be identified among

- [00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=2168) Again, this credit criticality can be identified among minor and major errors or errors in the provision of services.

- [00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=2170) minor and major errors or errors in the provision of services.

- [00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=2184) One of the errors there is an error in the presentation.

- [00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=2187) is an error in the presentation. That other is a flat error. Yes,

- [00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=2191) That other is a flat error. Yes, system failure, system failure damages the system

- [00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=2195) system failure, system failure damages the system itself or data. This is

- [00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=2198) itself or data. This is generally only necessary, but

- [00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=2200) generally only necessary, but will it be linked to other types of failures.

- [00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=2203) will it be linked to other types of failures. Yes, security metrics and reliability

- [00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=2208) Yes, security metrics and reliability metrics are units of measurement for system reliability.

- [00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=2211) metrics are units of measurement for system reliability. System reliability is

- [00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=2213) System reliability is

- [00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=2226) measured by counting the number of operational failures and, where appropriate, by correlating these with the requests made to the system and the time the system has been operating. How are people dying? We count the

- [00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=2228) people dying? We count the number of operational failures.

- [00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=2231) number of operational failures.

- [00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=2238) We also measure it by correlating these with the requests made to the system and the time the system has been operating.

- [00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=2241) A long-term measurement program is necessary to assess the reliability of critical systems.

- [00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=2253) probability of failure on demand, that is, the probability of failure resulting from demand on demand,

- [00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=2256) failure resulting from demand on demand, and the occurrence of the

- [00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=2258) and the occurrence of the failure itself.

- [00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=2262) failure itself. Let me see,

- [00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=2263) Let me see, my dear. Hey, are you here now?

- [00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=2271) my dear. Hey, are you here now? So, you requested service, and

- [00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=2274) So, you requested service, and a failure occurred when you requested it.

- [00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=2276) a failure occurred when you requested it. I haven't dealt with the probability of this

- [00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=2281) I haven't dealt with the probability of this happening yet. The rate of failures is the average

- [00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=2285) happening yet. The rate of failures is the average time until failure, how much

- [00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=2287) time until failure, how much trouble occurs in the mouth, and how

- [00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=2291) trouble occurs in the mouth, and how long it takes. It obviously means the same thing until the next failure.

- [00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=2294) long it takes. It obviously means the same thing until the next failure.

- [00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=2341) relatively infrequently. This is useful for protection systems where the service is requested and the

- [00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=2344) This is useful for protection systems where the service is requested and the service is not delivered.

- [00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=2631) not only the number of system failures but also the consequences of these failures. This means that a

- [00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=2633) but also the consequences of these failures. This means that a small error

- [00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=2636) small error may occur in large numbers, but this

- [00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=2639) may occur in large numbers, but this may not have a significant consequence. If a single, very serious

- [00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=2641) may not have a significant consequence. If a single, very serious error occurs, this

- [00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=2644) error occurs, this can lead to fatal errors, even fatal errors. If serious

- [00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=2648) can lead to fatal errors, even fatal errors. If serious failures are

- [00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=2650) failures are

- [00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=2657) clearly more damaging than those where recovery is simple, and even if the number is small, they can lead to much worse consequences.

- [00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=2659) lead to much worse consequences.

- [00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=2664) Therefore, in some cases, different reliability

- [00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=2666) different reliability specifications can be defined for different types of failures.

- [00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=2670) specifications can be defined for different types of failures. Over-specification of reliability is

- [00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=2673) Over-specification of reliability is probably not exceeded, but

- [00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=2677) probably not exceeded, but to me, yes, Arto, we will rely on

- [00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=2682) to me, yes, Arto, we will rely on those who see it. Over-specification is

- [00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=2685) those who see it. Over-specification is a situation where reliability is determined to be high.

- [00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=2695) we said is a trade-off between the two. There is a red dot in Bodrum. It is cheaper to

- [00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=2698) in Bodrum. It is cheaper to accept errors rather than prevent them and deal with them. In other words,

- [00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=2700) accept errors rather than prevent them and deal with them. In other words,

- [00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=2705) we accept that errors can occur and what will we do in case of an error? How will our device handle it? We

- [00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=2814) Transient failures, which can take user actions such as recalibration of the machine, can be accepted at a relatively low t&amp;a value.

- [00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=2817) failures, which can take user actions such as recalibration of the machine, can be accepted at a relatively low t&amp;a value. For example,

- [00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=2820) For example, a failure of 0.002 means that a failure can occur for every 500 TL.

- [00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=2823) a failure of 0.002 means that a failure can occur for every 500 TL. Permanent failures require

- [00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=2825) Permanent failures require re-examination by the software manufacturer.

- [00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=2827) re-examination by the software manufacturer.

- [00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=2839) This should not be more than once a year. Therefore, TW-2002 should be less than the number of requests received per year. If you

- [00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=2841) requests received per year. If you

- [00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=2844) receive 100 billion requests in the new year, there should be a lower reason.

- [00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=2846) there should be a lower reason. For example, a

- [00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=2849) For example, a functional, reliable, reliability

- [00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=2852) functional, reliable, reliability requirement should lead to a mouth. Defining the requirements to ensure that

- [00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=2855) requirement should lead to a mouth. Defining the requirements to ensure that incorrect data is detected before opening,

- [00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=2857) incorrect data is detected before opening,

- [00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=2862) checking the requirements to ensure that the system is recovered after a failure. My

- [00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=2868) recovery requirements should be included. The requirements specifying the system's backup

- [00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=2870) included. The requirements specifying the system's backup features will

- [00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=2872) features will be used to help recover the system. The

- [00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=2874) be used to help recover the system. The security process

- [00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=2877) security process should also be included. Important mental

- [00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=2882) should also be included. Important mental health hospital management systems should also require me to

- [00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=2886) health hospital management systems should also require me to request mental health patient management. If

- [00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=2893) request mental health patient management. If security-oriented maintenance works, the

- [00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=2895) security-oriented maintenance works, the functional ones should be included. Let's see what the

- [00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=2899) functional ones should be included. Let's see what the predefined A101 interval for all operator entries is. The

- [00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=2902) predefined A101 interval for all operator entries is. The system should check that all

- [00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=2904) system should check that all operator entries

- [00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=2906) operator entries are entered within this predefined interval. Is the

- [00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=2908) are entered within this predefined interval. Is the control system?

- [00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=2915) control system? Copies of the patient database

- [00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=2918) Copies of the patient database will be stored on the server located in the same building for two months.

- [00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=2920) will be stored on the server located in the same building for two months. Recovery redundancy. The

- [00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=2923) Recovery redundancy. The current version of the programming braking

- [00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=2926) current version of the programming braking control system will be used to implement the

- [00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=2928) control system will be used to implement the redundancy process. A secure subset of the island should be

- [00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=2932) redundancy process. A secure subset of the island should be implemented and checked using static analysis.

- [00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=2934) implemented and checked using static analysis.

- [00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=2942) Let's see what the English translation of this process is. For example, all your operator entries are

- [00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=2955) For example, all your operator entries are here. So, all operators said, "All operators."

- [00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=2958) here. So, all operators said, "All operators."

- [00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=2965) We developed an entire operation for all operators to enter any information. So, suddenly, my mother and I, for example, let me

- [00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=2972) my mother and I, for example, let me

- [00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=2987) look at the return of copies of the book for patients, like this medication dosage. Okay, let me see if the hospital stores two copies in two different

- [00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=2989) the hospital stores two copies in two different buildings.

- [00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=2991) buildings. Why? Because if a fire breaks out in such a building

- [00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=2993) Why? Because if a fire breaks out in such a building and you're storing two copies

- [00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=2998) and you're storing two copies there, what happens? Both are the

- [00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=3000) there, what happens? Both are the version that fixes the problem. Let's

- [00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=3003) version that fixes the problem. Let's look at the latest version here. So, the

- [00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=3010) look at the latest version here. So, the message system is like two different versions of the

- [00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=3013) message system is like two different versions of the system. What happens to the control system

- [00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=3027) system. What happens to the control system application? For example, if one system goes down, the

- [00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=3029) application? For example, if one system goes down, the other system can step in and

- [00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=3031) other system can step in and control it. Mom, that's what's

- [00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=3032) control it. Mom, that's what's done in airplanes. They even have different teams developing the aircraft's

- [00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=3036) done in airplanes. They even have different teams developing the aircraft's software in different programming languages.

- [00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=3038) software in different programming languages.

- [00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=3041) There's a main system, and then there's the main system. After that, there's another subsystem

- [00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=3043) After that, there's another subsystem like Istanbul.

- [00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=3047) like Istanbul. A secure subset of the island should be

- [00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=3049) A secure subset of the island should be checked frequently and instantly. What is this? HD

- [00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=3057) checked frequently and instantly. What is this? HD subscribers, I wonder.

- [00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=3064) And this isn't Ada in Turkish. I couldn't figure it out later. Let's move on.

- [00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=3072) couldn't figure it out later. Let's move on. Security features, security

- [00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=3075) Security features, security specifications, security requirements

- [00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=3077) specifications, security requirements specifications have something in common.

- [00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=3081) specifications have something in common. Look, there's a security requirement in

- [00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=3084) Look, there's a security requirement in both cases. Your concern is

- [00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=3086) both cases. Your concern is to prevent something bad from happening. There are four major differences.

- [00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=3090) to prevent something bad from happening. There are four major differences. So, what are these security issues? The

- [00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=3092) So, what are these security issues? The software is a coincidence. The enemy

- [00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=3095) software is a coincidence. The enemy doesn't work in an iron environment. In terms of security,

- [00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=3099) doesn't work in an iron environment. In terms of security,

- [00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=3105) shouldn't you assume that attackers have knowledge of system vulnerabilities? Look carefully, one is security.

- [00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=3111) Look carefully, one is security. One is either voice or security. Let's say the

- [00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=3115) One is either voice or security. Let's say the Vocational High School Police Department.

- [00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=3119) Vocational High School Police Department. Yes, safety is one,

- [00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=3124) Yes, safety is one, safety is another. So, for example,

- [00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=3132) safety is another. So, for example, what's the pump system? There's no one in the pump system. It's

- [00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=3136) what's the pump system? There's no one in the pump system. It's not an enemy to us. It's

- [00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=3139) not an enemy to us. It's attached to our own bodies and it's working.

- [00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=3142) attached to our own bodies and it's working. Therefore, rather than an external intervener, an

- [00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=3143) Therefore, rather than an external intervener, an error can occur within itself.

- [00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=3145) error can occur within itself.

- [00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=3150) But for example, what we said is a chemical production facility. An

- [00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=3155) a chemical production facility. An external attack could occur.

- [00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=3157) external attack could occur. So, the system

- [00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=3159) So, the system needs to have vulnerabilities. For example,

- [00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=3162) needs to have vulnerabilities. For example, I gave a harmful example in the last lesson. What did they do recently?

- [00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=3165) I gave a harmful example in the last lesson. What did they do recently? They added it to oil processing facilities. They

- [00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=3169) They added it to oil processing facilities. They encrypt information with ransone and

- [00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=3171) encrypt information with ransone and

- [00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=3177) are said to receive very serious cryptocurrency payments. This means there

- [00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=3181) was a vulnerability, a weakness somehow. Hackers used it and caused serious damage and

- [00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=3183) used it and caused serious damage and made a significant amount of money.

- [00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=3188) made a significant amount of money. When failures occur,

- [00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=3190) When failures occur,

- [00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=3194) you can search for the root cause or weakness that caused the failure. The failure is intentional and the attacker can

- [00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=3196) failure is intentional and the attacker can

- [00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=3201) hide the cause of the failure. In other words, the attacker can

- [00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=3203) attacker can prevent it. Closing a system is a

- [00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=3206) prevent it. Closing a system is a security-related failure.

- [00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=3207) security-related failure. It can prevent a shutdown. An

- [00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=3210) It can prevent a shutdown. An attack can have a purpose. Look at two

- [00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=3212) attack can have a purpose. Look at two situations. It could also be that

- [00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=3215) situations. It could also be that your computer got infected by your mother, here

- [00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=3217) your computer got infected by your mother, here is the doc If you close it immediately, you can

- [00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=3219) is the doc If you close it immediately, you can

- [00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=3224) prevent further file encryption and recover it. But shutting down the system for the purpose of attack

- [00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=3227) shutting down the system for the purpose of attack will already have succeeded. Security-

- [00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=3230) will already have succeeded. Security- related events are not created by a clever enemy.

- [00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=3232) related events are not created by a clever enemy. Look, if the security

- [00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=3234) Look, if the security system is a spontaneous

- [00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=3236) system is a spontaneous event that harms us and our environment, an attacker

- [00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=3239) event that harms us and our environment, an attacker

- [00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=3245) can investigate the weaknesses that end with time to discover them. But when there is an 18 error, what is he doing there? He

- [00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=3248) when there is an 18 error, what is he doing there? He is investigating the system's vulnerability. These security

- [00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=3251) is investigating the system's vulnerability. These security requirements are defined.

- [00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=3253) requirements are defined. Requirements, authentication

- [00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=3255) Requirements, authentication requirements, see what we have. What is there to define? Unnecessary authentication requirements,

- [00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=3258) requirements, see what we have. What is there to define? Unnecessary authentication requirements,

- [00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=3262) authorization requirements, immunity requirements,

- [00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=3274) security audit requirements, system maintenance, security is necessary.

- [00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=3277) maintenance, security is necessary. Oh, there is a pre-approved assessment process for security developments.

- [00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=3280) Oh, there is a pre-approved assessment process for security developments. Hasret

- [00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=3285) Aynen Tevfik has his wife. So, we are evaluating our assets one by one.

- [00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=3290) So, we are evaluating our assets one by one. Why do we have them? Forgive us.

- [00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=3292) Why do we have them? Forgive us. Foil assessment, that is, we

- [00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=3297) are moving on to another of our assets. What types of dangers do we have for TV Tay lace pique?

- [00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=3299) What types of dangers do we have for TV Tay lace pique? This is the danger for Asian Expojur

- [00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=3304) This is the danger for Asian Expojur Assassin. So, how much of this assessment has

- [01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=3945) helps identify problems, inconsistencies, and deficiencies in these requirements. So, identifying errors before starting a project

- [01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=3947) identifying errors before starting a project really reduces costs. Because

- [01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=3950) really reduces costs. Because after the start, correction is much more difficult

- [01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=3952) after the start, correction is much more difficult and costly. Since the specification

- [01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=4058) define a form and control it. So,

- [01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=4061) So, you can think of it as an algorithm and programming language. If

- [01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=4070) you use a formal method like the ben method, you can transform the official specification into a correct program. If it is

- [01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=4094) understand the specification and therefore

- [01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=4098) can't evaluate whether it's accurately represented and formally developed. However,

- [01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=4101) However, assessing the costs of developing it is easy,

- [01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=4111) may be reluctant to invest in formal methods, so we're more interested in the benefits.

- [01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ct8-hjcEG4&t=4114) we're more interested in the benefits. This approach isn't for software engineers.
