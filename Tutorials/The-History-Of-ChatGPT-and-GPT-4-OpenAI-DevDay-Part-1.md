### Video Transcription


- [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypZLlWMb6SA&t=0) But first, I'd like to take a minute to talk&nbsp; about some of the stuff that we've done over&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypZLlWMb6SA&t=4) the past year. About a year ago, November 30th,&nbsp; we shipped ChatGPT as a lowkey research preview,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypZLlWMb6SA&t=12) and that went pretty well. In March, we&nbsp; followed that up with the launch of GPT-4,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypZLlWMb6SA&t=19) still the most capable model out in the world.&nbsp; And in the last few months, we launched voice&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypZLlWMb6SA&t=31) and vision capabilities, so that ChatGPT&nbsp; can now see, hear, and speak. There's a lot,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypZLlWMb6SA&t=39) you don't have to clap each time. And more&nbsp; recently, we launched DALL E3, the world's most&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypZLlWMb6SA&t=44) advanced image model. You can use it, of course,&nbsp; inside of ChatGPT. For our enterprise customers,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypZLlWMb6SA&t=51) we launched ChatGPT. ChatGPT Enterprise, which&nbsp; offers enterprise-grade security and privacy,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypZLlWMb6SA&t=56) higher-speed GPT-4 access, longer context windows,&nbsp; a lot more. Today, we've got about 2 million&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypZLlWMb6SA&t=63) developers building on our API for a wide variety&nbsp; of use cases, doing amazing stuff. Over 92% of&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypZLlWMb6SA&t=70) Fortune 500 companies building on our products.&nbsp; And we have about 100 million weekly active users&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypZLlWMb6SA&t=77) now on ChatGPT. And what's incredible on that&nbsp; is we got there entirely through word of mouth.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypZLlWMb6SA&t=86) People just find it useful and tell their friends.&nbsp; OpenAI is the most advanced and the most widely&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypZLlWMb6SA&t=92) used AI platform in the world now. But numbers&nbsp; never tell the whole picture on something like&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypZLlWMb6SA&t=99) this. What's really important is how people&nbsp; use the products, how people are using AI.
