### Video Transcription


- [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTzlQ0tjxj0&t=0) Greetings everyone. Today I am going to show you&nbsp; the latest method, the most accurate, and the most&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTzlQ0tjxj0&t=7) performant method of generating images and videos&nbsp; on your Windows local computer with the one-click&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTzlQ0tjxj0&t=15) installation and setup. I am going to show you&nbsp; how to use SwarmUI and how to download models&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTzlQ0tjxj0&t=22) and start using them immediately on your Windows&nbsp; computer. This will be an epic tutorial that will&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTzlQ0tjxj0&t=30) make your local image and video generation many&nbsp; times easier and with the maximum optimization.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTzlQ0tjxj0&t=38) Maybe you heard of the ComfyUI. The ComfyUI is&nbsp; so hard to use, but we can still leverage its&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTzlQ0tjxj0&t=46) performance, its features with the SwarmUI. And&nbsp; my installation even supports out-of-the-box Sage&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTzlQ0tjxj0&t=53) Attention. Maybe you also heard of it. It is the&nbsp; fastest attention that makes your generations way&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTzlQ0tjxj0&t=60) faster for both image and video generation.&nbsp; And I will introduce you the application&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTzlQ0tjxj0&t=67) that I have developed for downloading models&nbsp; with the maximum speed and maximum easiness.&nbsp;

- [00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTzlQ0tjxj0&t=73) So far we have two model bundles: Flux model&nbsp; bundle and High Dream L1 model bundle. With just&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTzlQ0tjxj0&t=81) clicking these buttons, it will download all the&nbsp; necessary files into your SwarmUI installation.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTzlQ0tjxj0&t=87) Moreover, we have all kind of models with&nbsp; one-click to download. So you will not&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTzlQ0tjxj0&t=93) spend time for finding models, downloading&nbsp; them into the accurate folders. Moreover,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTzlQ0tjxj0&t=98) I also have how-to-use links. So when we go&nbsp; to these links, we will learn how to use this&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTzlQ0tjxj0&t=105) application, this model in the SwarmUI itself. You see, we support High Dream, we support&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTzlQ0tjxj0&t=110) Stable Diffusion 1.5 models, we support Stable&nbsp; Diffusion XL models, we support Stable Diffusion&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTzlQ0tjxj0&t=116) 3.5 large models. We support YOLO Face inpainting&nbsp; models. We support text encoder models, T5-XXL,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTzlQ0tjxj0&t=124) UMT T5-XXL, Clip models, LLM text encoder. We&nbsp; support video generation models: Wan 2.1, Hunyuan,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTzlQ0tjxj0&t=134) Fast Hunyuan models. We support SkyReels. And you&nbsp; see that we support GGUF and also BF16 and FP16,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTzlQ0tjxj0&t=143) FP8 versions. We support Genmo Mochi 1, Lightricks LTX video, VAE model.&nbsp;

- [00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTzlQ0tjxj0&t=150) And this application will get better and better&nbsp; as you make requests to me. So you can tell me&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTzlQ0tjxj0&t=156) that add to this model, add to that model,&nbsp; and hopefully I will update it. In the very&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTzlQ0tjxj0&t=160) top of the application, you can also search&nbsp; and filter with the model name. So it is so,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTzlQ0tjxj0&t=167) so easy to use and so easy to install. Using SwarmUI with a manually installed ComfyUI&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTzlQ0tjxj0&t=174) backend is working better than the pre-compiled&nbsp; ComfyUI backend. So today I will also show you&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTzlQ0tjxj0&t=181) how to use properly installed ComfyUI backend in&nbsp; the SwarmUI for maximum performance. By the way,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTzlQ0tjxj0&t=187) these images that you are seeing right now are&nbsp; being generated with High Dream L1 Dev GGUF&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTzlQ0tjxj0&t=194) Q8 model. GGUF Q8 is almost same quality as the&nbsp; highest quality BF16 model itself. Currently I am&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTzlQ0tjxj0&t=203) generating with my dual GPUs. I have RTX 5090 and&nbsp; I have RTX 3090 Ti. So you see both of the GPUs&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTzlQ0tjxj0&t=212) are running almost at full power. And also I am&nbsp; recording a video right now, so you see my PC is&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTzlQ0tjxj0&t=219) under heavy load. However, SwarmUI with ComfyUI&nbsp; backend is still able to handle generations&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTzlQ0tjxj0&t=227) really, really fast. They are getting generated&nbsp; right now live as you are seeing right now.&nbsp;

- [00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTzlQ0tjxj0&t=232) So, let's begin the tutorial and how&nbsp; to install and use these applications.&nbsp;

- [00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTzlQ0tjxj0&t=237) So, we have SwarmUI one-click installer with&nbsp; the SwarmUI Unified Model Downloader. But this&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTzlQ0tjxj0&t=244) Unified Model Downloader can also be used&nbsp; for ComfyUI or for other applications that&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTzlQ0tjxj0&t=250) you use as well. It supports custom folder&nbsp; paths and also ComfyUI installer. The links&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTzlQ0tjxj0&t=256) of these installers will be in the description&nbsp; of the video, so check them out. First of all,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTzlQ0tjxj0&t=260) let's begin with downloading the latest SwarmUI&nbsp; Model Downloader zip file. So, latest zip file&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTzlQ0tjxj0&t=266) is SwarmUI Model Downloader version 29. I have&nbsp; just updated it to the latest version. It is&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTzlQ0tjxj0&t=273) downloaded. Let's also download the manual&nbsp; installer of ComfyUI. By manual, I mean that&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTzlQ0tjxj0&t=279) we are not using pre-compiled. We are going to&nbsp; install with our installers. Move the downloaded&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTzlQ0tjxj0&t=284) files into any of your drives. I will use my E&nbsp; drive. First of all, let's extract the ComfyUI&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTzlQ0tjxj0&t=292) installation. This will be used as a backend. And&nbsp; why not use the pre-compiled backend? Because this&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTzlQ0tjxj0&t=299) is way better. When you use the pre-compiled&nbsp; backend, it is not very up-to-date, it causes&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTzlQ0tjxj0&t=305) problems when installing new libraries. So I&nbsp; will use the windows_install.bat file. This is&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTzlQ0tjxj0&t=312) by default supporting xFormers, Flash Attention,&nbsp; Sage Attention, Triton, whatever you need. And it&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTzlQ0tjxj0&t=319) works on all GPUs including RTX 5000 series. I recommend to use Python 3.10. You need to&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTzlQ0tjxj0&t=327) have Python installed on your computer. So if you&nbsp; are using another version, you can select it. I&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTzlQ0tjxj0&t=333) really recommend Python 3.10. So I will select&nbsp; option 1. So you can choose Flash Attention,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTzlQ0tjxj0&t=339) Sage Attention, or both attentions. Let's&nbsp; choose the both of the attentions. And it&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTzlQ0tjxj0&t=344) will also install the xFormers as well. This is&nbsp; going to install with latest official Torch 2.7.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTzlQ0tjxj0&t=351) Don't worry, it will work on all GPUs and also&nbsp; pre-compiled Flash Attention, Sage Attention,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTzlQ0tjxj0&t=358) xFormers. I have compiled myself xFormers&nbsp; and Flash Attention, and the Sage Attention&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTzlQ0tjxj0&t=363) and Triton is from our legendary woct0rdho. Maybe&nbsp; you heard this guy. This guy is the sole developer&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTzlQ0tjxj0&t=373) of Triton and Sage Attention for Windows. So, meanwhile this is getting installed,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTzlQ0tjxj0&t=378) we can also install SwarmUI. We don't need to&nbsp; wait. So let's just extract the SwarmUI Model&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTzlQ0tjxj0&t=383) Downloader. Extract all, and here. So let's&nbsp; begin with installing SwarmUI. You see we have&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTzlQ0tjxj0&t=389) windows_install_swarmui.bat file. This is from&nbsp; the official repository, nothing is special here.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTzlQ0tjxj0&t=394) It will just start the installation like this. The&nbsp; options that you are going to choose is important.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTzlQ0tjxj0&t=400) We are going to choose Agree, Customize Settings,&nbsp; Yes. Modern Dark or whatever the you wish,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTzlQ0tjxj0&t=408) just yourself. And this is the most crucial&nbsp; part. We are not going to use ComfyUI Local.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTzlQ0tjxj0&t=414) This is pre-installed, pre-compiled ComfyUI. I&nbsp; do not recommend this. So let's go with None,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTzlQ0tjxj0&t=420) and Next. You can download, but I don't recommend.&nbsp; Our downloader is faster. Next, and Yes,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTzlQ0tjxj0&t=426) I am sure to install and installed. That's it. So the SwarmUI has been installed. Let's look&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTzlQ0tjxj0&t=431) at the ComfyUI installation. It is still getting&nbsp; installed as you are seeing right now. All right.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTzlQ0tjxj0&t=436) The ComfyUI has been installed. You see, press&nbsp; any key to continue. And the SwarmUI has been&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTzlQ0tjxj0&t=441) started. Now what we need to do is adding backend.&nbsp; So click Server, click Backends, and get to this&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTzlQ0tjxj0&t=449) page and click ComfyUI Self-Starting. Click OK.&nbsp; And it shows two backends. This is a bug. Let's&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTzlQ0tjxj0&t=456) refresh and it is fixed. So let's check this,&nbsp; click this green icon for editing. We need to&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTzlQ0tjxj0&t=463) give path of the ComfyUI here. So let's return&nbsp; back to our ComfyUI installation. It was here.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTzlQ0tjxj0&t=469) Enter inside the ComfyUI and you see there is&nbsp; main.py file here. So let's copy like this, and&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTzlQ0tjxj0&t=476) /main.py file. This is the backend. If you want&nbsp; to use Sage Attention, --use-sage-attention like&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTzlQ0tjxj0&t=486) this. Sage Attention works only RTX 3000 and newer&nbsp; GPUs. So like 4080 or 5060. So 3000, 4000 and 5000&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTzlQ0tjxj0&t=496) series are supporting. But don't worry, if your&nbsp; GPU is not supporting, it will use either xFormers&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTzlQ0tjxj0&t=503) or it will use the Torch attention itself. So wait for backends to be loaded. When we go&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTzlQ0tjxj0&t=508) to the Logs and Debug, it will show us what&nbsp; is happening right now. So it is installing&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTzlQ0tjxj0&t=514) the missing libraries into our manually installed&nbsp; ComfyUI. And our ComfyUI has been installed with a&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTzlQ0tjxj0&t=522) virtual environment. So this installation will not&nbsp; break any other applications or installations that&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTzlQ0tjxj0&t=528) I have. This is 100 percentage isolated to here.&nbsp; So it is 100 percentage secure. With this way,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTzlQ0tjxj0&t=535) you can have as many as different ComfyUI&nbsp; installations and we will use the model&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTzlQ0tjxj0&t=541) folder of the SwarmUI itself. Or you can&nbsp; give any model folders. How? When you go&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTzlQ0tjxj0&t=546) to the Server Configuration, you can set&nbsp; your model root and other model paths&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTzlQ0tjxj0&t=551) from here. Okay, so the installation has&nbsp; been completed. I have my backend ready.&nbsp;

- [00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTzlQ0tjxj0&t=557) Since I have also another GPU, let me show you.&nbsp; So open a CMD, type pip install nvitop, then type&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTzlQ0tjxj0&t=565) nvitop and you will get to this page. By the way,&nbsp; yes. So let's start again. nvitop, and here. So&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTzlQ0tjxj0&t=572) I have RTX 5090 and I have RTX 3090 Ti. So I can&nbsp; also utilize my second GPU. To do that, let's copy&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTzlQ0tjxj0&t=581) this, click ComfyUI Self-Starting, OK, and paste&nbsp; it here. So copy this, paste here and give the GPU&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTzlQ0tjxj0&t=588) ID 1 and Save. So this will work on the second GPU&nbsp; and this will work on the first GPU. And we are&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTzlQ0tjxj0&t=595) ready. Our SwarmUI has been started. However,&nbsp; currently we do not have any of the models.&nbsp;

- [00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTzlQ0tjxj0&t=600) So, to download the models, let's return&nbsp; back to our SwarmUI folder where we have&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTzlQ0tjxj0&t=606) extracted the files. You see here. Click&nbsp; windows_start_download_models_app.bat file. More&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTzlQ0tjxj0&t=611) info, Run anyway. It will generate a VENV virtual&nbsp; environment folder here, install the necessary&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTzlQ0tjxj0&t=617) libraries, which is not much, just Gradio and&nbsp; some other libraries, then it will start the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTzlQ0tjxj0&t=623) application. Let's just wait. For this to work,&nbsp; you also need to have Python installed. So if you&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTzlQ0tjxj0&t=629) don't know how to install Python and the other&nbsp; libraries, I have an excellent tutorial video.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTzlQ0tjxj0&t=634) The link will be in the ComfyUI installation post&nbsp; as you are seeing right now, Windows Requirements.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTzlQ0tjxj0&t=640) So you can watch this tutorial and learn it&nbsp; with full details and step-by-step guidance.&nbsp;

- [00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTzlQ0tjxj0&t=645) So the Model Downloader started. This is the Model&nbsp; Downloader interface. Whichever the model you want&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTzlQ0tjxj0&t=650) to use, you can search here and download.&nbsp; This is an extremely advanced UI. And also,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTzlQ0tjxj0&t=656) if a model is missing here, just message me from&nbsp; Patreon and hopefully I will add it as soon as&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTzlQ0tjxj0&t=662) possible. So for demonstration, we can download&nbsp; Flux Models bundle. It will download all these&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTzlQ0tjxj0&t=669) models. So let's click Download Flux Models&nbsp; bundle. And you can watch the status here. So&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTzlQ0tjxj0&t=674) it will utilize my entire network right now. Why?&nbsp; Because we are utilizing enable HF transfer. This&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTzlQ0tjxj0&t=681) is a special download method and it will speed up&nbsp; your downloads to your maximum network speed. Let&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTzlQ0tjxj0&t=688) me show you from Task Manager, Performance, and&nbsp; you see I am downloading with 500 megabits per&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTzlQ0tjxj0&t=694) second, like 600 megabits per second. I am also&nbsp; uploading models into more optimized Hugging&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTzlQ0tjxj0&t=702) Face XET repositories so that it will be even faster&nbsp; hopefully in future without any errors. Moreover,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTzlQ0tjxj0&t=710) this downloader has queue system and if a file&nbsp; has been downloaded previously, it will not&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTzlQ0tjxj0&t=717) re-download it. So this is an amazing feature.&nbsp; For example, I can also queue video generation&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTzlQ0tjxj0&t=723) models download, like Wan 2.1 models download. So&nbsp; I can click this and it will queue that. Let's&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTzlQ0tjxj0&t=729) see. So you see the queue size is now 7 and it&nbsp; shows that queued Wan 2.1 text-to-video model.&nbsp;

- [00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTzlQ0tjxj0&t=736) Moreover, if you don't know how to&nbsp; use these models inside SwarmUI,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTzlQ0tjxj0&t=740) just click these links and read them. For example,&nbsp; this is Wan 2.1 parameters in SwarmUI. You can read&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTzlQ0tjxj0&t=748) here and learn it. Hopefully I will make different&nbsp; tutorial videos, so stay subscribed to our channel&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTzlQ0tjxj0&t=753) to not miss any of them. This application works&nbsp; on RunPod and also on Massed Compute as well. The&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTzlQ0tjxj0&t=760) instructions are all in the zip file: Massed&nbsp; Compute instructions, RunPod instructions.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTzlQ0tjxj0&t=765) Hopefully I will make a separate video for them to&nbsp; not make this video very long. So stay subscribed.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTzlQ0tjxj0&t=772) And this will download all of the models with&nbsp; the maximum speed, then you will be able to&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTzlQ0tjxj0&t=777) use models inside your SwarmUI installation. The&nbsp; models will be automatically downloaded into the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTzlQ0tjxj0&t=783) accurate folders, so you don't need to spend&nbsp; time with them. It will show you everything,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTzlQ0tjxj0&t=789) every information on the screen and also on the&nbsp; terminal, on the CMD window. If you have any&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTzlQ0tjxj0&t=795) questions, just ask me and hopefully I will answer&nbsp; them. And how to use these models are so simple.&nbsp;

- [00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTzlQ0tjxj0&t=802) Let me start my other installation which I&nbsp; have been showing you in the beginning of&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTzlQ0tjxj0&t=806) the video. So for starting the SwarmUI after&nbsp; installation and models have been downloaded,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTzlQ0tjxj0&t=812) just click the Windows_start_swarmui.bat file.&nbsp; SwarmUI now automatically updates, so there is no&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTzlQ0tjxj0&t=819) update button anymore. Then once the models have&nbsp; been downloaded, go to Models, click Refresh and&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTzlQ0tjxj0&t=826) select the model that you want. One of the amazing&nbsp; feature of our downloader is that we download the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTzlQ0tjxj0&t=832) highest quality T5-XXL and we give you option to&nbsp; download highest quality models as well, like Flux&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTzlQ0tjxj0&t=840) Dev FP16 model or you can also download Flux Dev&nbsp; GGUF model. When you first time try to run a GGUF&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTzlQ0tjxj0&t=848) model, it will ask you to install GGUF extension.&nbsp; It is important. And also in some models, it may&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTzlQ0tjxj0&t=856) require you to set the model type. For example,&nbsp; this is automatically recognized High Dream L1 Dev&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTzlQ0tjxj0&t=863) GGUF Q8 model. So when I click this hamburger menu&nbsp; and say Edit Metadata, you can set it from here,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTzlQ0tjxj0&t=872) like High Dream architecture. It usually recognize&nbsp; all of the models, but if it doesn't recognize,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTzlQ0tjxj0&t=878) select the architecture from here&nbsp; and save it, then it will work.&nbsp;

- [00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTzlQ0tjxj0&t=882) Let me also show you the GGUF installation so you&nbsp; will not have any issues with that. To do that,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTzlQ0tjxj0&t=888) I will just copy my previous model to not wait&nbsp; it downloading. So the models are saved inside&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTzlQ0tjxj0&t=895) diffusion models usually. So this model is saved&nbsp; inside the diffusion models. So let's copy this&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTzlQ0tjxj0&t=902) and go back to our new installation. Just copy&nbsp; paste it. You see our download is continuing. It&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTzlQ0tjxj0&t=908) downloaded the Flux Dev model, now downloading&nbsp; Flux Fill Dev model. And return back to our new&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTzlQ0tjxj0&t=913) installation. It is here and the models are here.&nbsp; So let's refresh. Yes, arrived. When I click Load&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTzlQ0tjxj0&t=920) Model, it will ask me Install GGUF support. You&nbsp; have to install this to be able to run GGUF. So&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTzlQ0tjxj0&t=927) Install, OK. You need to wait backends to be&nbsp; loaded, then it says Installed. Please wait&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTzlQ0tjxj0&t=934) while backends restarting. If it doesn't work,&nbsp; you may need to restart SwarmUI, but it usually&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTzlQ0tjxj0&t=939) works. Just follow the logs from here, Debug&nbsp; menu, and you will see that it is installing&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTzlQ0tjxj0&t=944) necessary libraries and starting. And after it has&nbsp; been started, it will load model into the VRAM,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTzlQ0tjxj0&t=951) into my GPU. You will also get this error. You see&nbsp; test C link fatal error. This is a Linux related&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTzlQ0tjxj0&t=959) error. Since we are running on Windows, you&nbsp; can just ignore this. This happens in my all&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTzlQ0tjxj0&t=965) applications, but you can safely ignore it. And&nbsp; the backend has been loaded and it is ready to use&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTzlQ0tjxj0&t=971) right now with the GGUF support as well. You can&nbsp; also install TeaCache and other stuff, but hopefully&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTzlQ0tjxj0&t=977) I will make different separate videos for them. So this is how you can begin using the very best&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTzlQ0tjxj0&t=983) models in your local computer after installing&nbsp; and downloading them. For example, this is a&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTzlQ0tjxj0&t=989) DreamBooth model that I have trained myself on.&nbsp; And let's generate an image as a demonstration&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTzlQ0tjxj0&t=995) before we end the tutorial. So we have an amazing&nbsp; Kohya configuration. It is also on Patreon. Let's&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTzlQ0tjxj0&t=1001) go to the Test Prompts. Let's select a Realism&nbsp; prompt. For example, this one. This is a model&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTzlQ0tjxj0&t=1006) that has been generated on me. Since this is a&nbsp; Flux model, let's make the 40 steps sampling,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTzlQ0tjxj0&t=1012) iPNDM, my favorite sampling. CFG is 1. This is&nbsp; for Flux and also High Dream is also same. Flux&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTzlQ0tjxj0&t=1019) Guidance Scale 4. And that's it. Let's generate&nbsp; an image. First, it will load it into the my&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTzlQ0tjxj0&t=1027) RTX 5090, then it will generate the image.&nbsp; Okay. Oh, we did set it as 100 images. Okay,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTzlQ0tjxj0&t=1033) let's see. And we have the two backends here, so&nbsp; it will use both of them. All right. It should&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTzlQ0tjxj0&t=1039) start loading in a moment. You can always watch&nbsp; the logs from here. Let's go to Debug and let's&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTzlQ0tjxj0&t=1046) see what is happening. Okay, it says that&nbsp; it is waiting for model to be loaded. Yes,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTzlQ0tjxj0&t=1051) now it is loading. We can watch the status from&nbsp; here. Yes, it is loading now first into the RAM,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTzlQ0tjxj0&t=1057) then it will move them into the GPUs. Okay, the&nbsp; first GPU is warming up, loading the model. Yes,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTzlQ0tjxj0&t=1064) the generation has been started. We can see that.&nbsp; Okay, let's see the image is getting generated.&nbsp;

- [00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTzlQ0tjxj0&t=1070) Then it will inpaint the face. I have been getting&nbsp; asked of, the inpainting model is not working.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTzlQ0tjxj0&t=1076) Because your installation were not accurate. So&nbsp; install as I have installed in this tutorial,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTzlQ0tjxj0&t=1081) then download the face models. For example, you&nbsp; can... let's refresh this page. It shouldn't&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTzlQ0tjxj0&t=1087) impact the download. You see it is returned&nbsp; back. Go to the Other Models, and you see&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTzlQ0tjxj0&t=1092) we have Auto YOLO Masking models. Then click here&nbsp; and just download. It will download the best face&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTzlQ0tjxj0&t=1099) automatic recognition, segmentation models.&nbsp; And you see, it has generated the image. Oh,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTzlQ0tjxj0&t=1105) there is one more thing which I need to show you.&nbsp; Let's cancel all sessions. Which is upscaling.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTzlQ0tjxj0&t=1111) This was also getting asked of me. What is the&nbsp; best upscaling? Best upscaling is like this. Let&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTzlQ0tjxj0&t=1118) me show you. So go to the Refine Upscale, enable&nbsp; it first. If you don't see Advanced options, click&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTzlQ0tjxj0&t=1123) here to see the Advanced options. Set the Refiner&nbsp; percentage 60 percentage. Let's click Reuse&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTzlQ0tjxj0&t=1129) Parameters to upscale this image. Enable Upscale,&nbsp; Refiner 60 percentage, and Refiner Upscaler 2x.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTzlQ0tjxj0&t=1137) And this is super important. I use 4x RealWebPhoto&nbsp; version 4. This is automatically downloaded with&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTzlQ0tjxj0&t=1143) our downloader. Where? You see we have Other&nbsp; Models here. When you click the Other Models&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTzlQ0tjxj0&t=1148) and when you go to the Image Upscaling models,&nbsp; you can download all of the image upscaling&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTzlQ0tjxj0&t=1153) models by clicking here and it will automatically&nbsp; download them for you into the accurate folder.&nbsp;

- [00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTzlQ0tjxj0&t=1159) Now first it will generate this image, then it&nbsp; will upscale it. Upscaling is really heavy because&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTzlQ0tjxj0&t=1166) from 1 megapixel to 4 megapixel we are upscaling&nbsp; with Refiner Upscale 2x. But this is really,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTzlQ0tjxj0&t=1174) really next level. It really improves the quality.&nbsp; I will show you in a moment. Okay, the upscale&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTzlQ0tjxj0&t=1180) has been completed. Okay, now watch carefully.&nbsp; Original image, upscaled image. Original image,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTzlQ0tjxj0&t=1186) upscaled image. You see the difference is huge.&nbsp; And probably I don't even need to face inpaint&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTzlQ0tjxj0&t=1192) this. You see the face inpainting has some&nbsp; noticeable area here because it is black. So&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTzlQ0tjxj0&t=1198) to remove this noticeable area there, you need to&nbsp; play the parameters here like Segment Mask Blur,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTzlQ0tjxj0&t=1204) Segment Mask Grow, the other things to remove&nbsp; it. I don't know the exact parameter right&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTzlQ0tjxj0&t=1208) now. I don't remember, but you can pretty much&nbsp; remove this as well. It is barely noticeable,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTzlQ0tjxj0&t=1213) but and also it can be really easily fixed&nbsp; it. But from this quality into this quality.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTzlQ0tjxj0&t=1219) And this is amazing. This is next level. Thank you so much, guys. You can always&nbsp;&nbsp;
