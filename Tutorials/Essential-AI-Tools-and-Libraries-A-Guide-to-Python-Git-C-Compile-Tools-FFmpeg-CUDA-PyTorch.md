### Video Transcription


- [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=0) Greetings, everyone.

- [00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=1) Welcome to the Pillars of AI Application Libraries: How to Install Tutorial.

- [00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=7) If you are interested in generative AI, such as Stable Diffusion, such as large language

- [00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=12) models, web UI, such as voice cloning, such as text-to-speech, image-to-image, text-to-image,

- [00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=19) text-to-video, video-to-video, image-to-video, and anything that includes AI, this tutorial

- [00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=26) will help you tremendously.

- [00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=28) This tutorial is prepared for regular users, not for programmers.

- [00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=33) Therefore, if you are not a programmer, if you are not an expert, watching and following

- [00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=38) this tutorial will make your AI journey much more easier.

- [00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=43) I am going to show you how to install any Python version.

- [00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=46) I will install Python 3.10 and 11 and show you how to set your default Python version.

- [00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=53) I am going to show how to install Microsoft Visual Studio C++ Compile tools.

- [00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=58) This installation will fix the Microsoft Visual C++ 14 or greater is required error, such

- [00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=64) as the error that you are getting when you are installing Roop deep fake application,

- [00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=70) or any other application that compiles its own wheel on your computer.

- [00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=75) I am going to show how to install and setup FFmpeg on your Windows.

- [00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=79) So all of the applications that depend on FFmpeg will work without any issues, such

- [00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=85) as Whisper or such as video animation AI applications.

- [00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=91) This installation will fix all of the errors that are related to FFmpeg.

- [00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=94) I will show how to install CUDA libraries.

- [00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=97) In some cases, CUDA libraries are also necessary for compiling, for installing AI applications,

- [00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=104) AI libraries.

- [00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=105) I will show how to install Git and Git Large, which is necessary, mandatory to clone and

- [00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=111) install open source repositories, GitHub repositories.

- [00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=115) I will show how to do Git checkout, Git pull, Git clone, Git stash, Git stash pop.

- [00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=121) These will be also very useful in your AI journey.

- [00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=126) If you are interested in AI, you really need to know these commands, what they do.

- [00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=131) I will show also advanced stuff such as generate your own virtual environment, and I will show

- [00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=136) how to activate already installed virtual environment and install or uninstall any library

- [00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=143) because sometimes you may need to install specific libraries to fix the errors.

- [00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=149) And by watching this tutorial, you will learn that as well.

- [00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=152) I will show how to have multiple Python versions, how to set your default Python version, how

- [00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=159) to generate a virtual environment, or install any application with a certain Python version.

- [00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=165) I suggest you to have a single Python version, Python 3.10.11, but if it is necessary because

- [00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=171) sometimes it is necessary to have multiple Python versions, after watching this tutorial,

- [00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=175) you will not have any issues.

- [00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=177) I will show how to install any application and set its environment path variable so you

- [00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=184) will be able to utilize all of the applications.

- [00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=187) I will show as an example runpodctl, which is used to transfer files between RunPod and

- [00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=193) your computer.

- [00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=194) So, this file link will be in the description of the video and also in the comment section

- [00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=198) of the video.

- [00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=199) I will update this file if it be necessary.

- [00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=201) I am showing everything on a freshly installed Windows 10 virtual machine.

- [00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=207) So, this is a clean installation, and I will show everything on this machine so you will

- [00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=213) not have any issues to follow this tutorial.

- [00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=216) So, please watch this tutorial very carefully, entirely, and I am giving you a guarantee

- [00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=223) that you will save a huge amount of time that will be caused by the possible errors and

- [00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=230) mistakes that you will encounter in the future.

- [00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=233) And just for this tutorial.

- [00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=234) I installed a fresh computer.

- [00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=236) So, I will show everything on a fresh computer.

- [00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=239) None of the things previously installed and this will make it easier to follow this tutorial.

- [00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=244) So, let me first open a cmd.

- [00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=248) Cmd is command line interface command prompt.

- [00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=250) Usually, we work with cmd when we are working with open-source applications.

- [00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=255) When I type Python, you see there is no Python, and it is opening this page.

- [00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=260) But do not install from this page.

- [00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=262) Installing from here will cause you problems in the future.

- [00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=265) So, no Python installed.

- [00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=267) When I type git, you see git is not installed.

- [00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=270) Let me also show you my environment path.

- [00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=272) Now, environment path and variables are extremely important.

- [00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=276) Why?

- [00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=277) Because applications will look at environment path to determine where the application is

- [00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=283) installed.

- [00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=284) By application, what I mean I mean that, for example, the Python where it is installed

- [00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=287) or your CUDA libraries where it is installed, or FFmpeg where it is installed.

- [00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=292) So, you need to understand and learn how to edit system environment variables, and edit

- [00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=299) path.

- [00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=300) I just typed env into my search bar, and I am opening edit system environment variables.

- [00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=306) This is inside the control panel.

- [00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=308) Then click this environment variables button here, and you see this is a fresh installation

- [00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=312) so there aren't any set environment variables.

- [00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=315) Let me show you the path variable.

- [00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=317) This is where the applications by default look and there is also a system variables

- [00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=322) path.

- [00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=323) As you are seeing right now, it is also fully empty.

- [00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=325) You just need to add applications to the path here.

- [00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=329) I will show them in the tutorial.

- [00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=331) Okay, so let's first begin with installing the Python.

- [00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=335) Why Python 3.x you may wonder because this is the most widely supported and best working

- [00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=343) Python version right now.

- [00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=344) So, do not install Python 11, 3.11, or 3.12.

- [00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=348) You will have a lot of problems with the open-source AI applications.

- [00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=353) So, to download it, let's go to this link.

- [00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=356) Let me also make this full screen.

- [00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=358) Okay, so this is the Python 3.10.11 official version.

- [00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=362) Let's download Windows installer 64 bit.

- [00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=366) Okay, it is downloaded.

- [00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=368) Let's start it.

- [00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=370) Now.

- [00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=371) Follow here very carefully.

- [00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=372) You see there is add Python exe to PATH.

- [00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=375) You need to select it so it will add it to our environment variables path.

- [00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=379) Also, click customize installation, select everything here.

- [00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=383) Next, select everything here, and also change this path.

- [00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=388) Install it directly into your C drive like this without any space character.

- [00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=393) So, do not install like this.

- [00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=395) Do not have any space character.

- [00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=397) Do not have any special English character.

- [00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=399) So, I will make it like this.

- [00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=402) Python 3.

- [00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=403) Actually Python 3.10.11.

- [00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=404) Okay, let's click install.

- [00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=407) It will ask me this okay, let's click yes and just wait.

- [00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=411) Okay, so the installation has been completed.

- [00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=412) There is also this important question to ask.

- [00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=417) Disable path length limit.

- [00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=418) You should also click this.

- [00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=420) It will disable the path length limit.

- [00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=423) It is important.

- [00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=424) And now when I start a new command line, I type cmd into my search bar and click command

- [00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=430) prompt.

- [00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=431) Let me show you where I am typing it.

- [00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=432) So, you see I have a search bar here.

- [00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=434) When I type cmd here, it is appearing like this.

- [00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=437) So, I start a command interface, and now when I type Python, I see 3.10.11 Why?

- [00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=444) Because it is looking into the system environment path.

- [00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=447) So, when I open my environment variables, click environment variables, and it is not

- [00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=452) inside this path inside user variables because this is specific to that user, and we installed

- [00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=459) it for all of the users.

- [00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=461) So, it is inside this system variables path, and it is added to the very top.

- [00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=468) As you are seeing right now.

- [00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=469) See Python 3.10.11 scripts, and see Python 3.10.11.

- [00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=474) This is how the applications will find your Python.

- [00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=478) Okay, Python installation has been completed.

- [00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=481) Now, as a next step, let's install Git because Git is necessary to clone AI repositories,

- [00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=487) GitHub repositories, and install the stuff.

- [00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=490) So, click download for Windows.

- [00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=492) Select it like this: 64-bit Git for Windows setup.

- [00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=496) Start to download.

- [00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=497) Run the application from downloads.

- [00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=499) Click yes.

- [00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=501) Just click next.

- [00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=502) Next next, you don't need to change anything, just click everything next and install.

- [00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=508) Because the default Git installation is sufficient for us to install AI applications.

- [00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=513) Okay, now when I type cmd, and when I type git, you see git is installed.

- [00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=520) Okay, nice.

- [00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=521) Then, what should we install?

- [00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=524) We need to install Visual Studio C++ Compile tools and why this is extremely important.

- [00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=532) I don't know have you seen my Roop the deep fake tutorial.

- [00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=537) It requires InsightFace library.

- [00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=540) And InsightFace library requires C++ tools.

- [00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=544) Let me demonstrate to you.

- [00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=545) So, I do pip install InsightFace and let's see the error that we are going to get because

- [00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=552) we don't have the C++ tools installed yet.

- [00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=556) It is installing all of the necessary packages as you are seeing right now, and when it is

- [00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=561) compiling, we get this error.

- [00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=563) Let me show you that.

- [00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=564) So, the error we got is Microsoft Visual C++ 14 or greater is required and that is why

- [00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=571) installation of InsightFace failed.

- [00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=573) A lot of my YouTube followers have got this error, and they had a hard time to fix this.

- [00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=581) So, let's go to the Visual Studio C++ Compile tools.

- [00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=586) Open this link and in here, scroll to down.

- [00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=590) In here, you will see Visual Studio tools.

- [00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=594) From here, go to the build tools for Visual Studio.

- [00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=597) Click download.

- [00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=599) Open in the downloads folder.

- [00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=601) Right-click, run as administrator.

- [00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=603) Click yes.

- [00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=605) Click continue.

- [00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=606) Then you will get this screen.

- [00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=608) On this screen select this.

- [00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=610) You see Desktop Development with C++ and you don't need to select anything else.

- [00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=616) This is the latest version 17.8.3 and click install - install while downloading.

- [00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=624) So, this is a big package, but it will install everything that we need for us meanwhile downloading.

- [00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=630) It may take a while depending on your internet speed and your hard drive speed.

- [00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=635) Okay, the installation has been completed.

- [00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=637) Let's close this window.

- [00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=639) It didn't even tell us to restart the Windows.

- [00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=642) Now I want to test the installation of InsightFace one more time.

- [00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=647) Let's open another cmd and do pip install InsightFace and let's see we will get any

- [00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=654) error or not.

- [00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=655) We should not get any error.

- [00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=657) Also, you need to open a new cmd after the installation.

- [00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=661) New command line interface.

- [00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=663) It is using the cached pip files.

- [00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=666) Okay, it is building the wheel.

- [00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=668) This is where it compiles itself and it compiled I think.

- [00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=673) No errors.

- [00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=674) So, it used the C++ tools that we have installed.

- [00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=679) Okay, now it is running the setup.py file.

- [00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=683) You can also disable this cache of the tools.

- [00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=685) So, I added another link here that shows the pip caching.

- [00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=690) Sometimes, your cache may get corrupted so you may need to clear your cache.

- [00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=696) When you open the link that I shared here, you will see in the very bottom pip cache

- [00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=700) list, pip cache list setuptools, pip cache purge.

- [00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=705) So this will clear your cache.

- [00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=707) So the pip will redownload all of the cached files again.

- [00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=712) You can also disable cache with this command.

- [00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=715) So, let's see the installation.

- [00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=717) Yes, the InsightFace has been installed without any error.

- [00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=721) So, the C++ tools installation fixed the major problem that you might encounter.

- [00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=727) So, when you encounter this problem, Microsoft Visual C++ 14 or greater is required, this

- [00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=734) is the thing that you need to install.

- [00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=736) I also added a link for Git Large.

- [00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=737) So, ever if you need Git Large, download it from here.

- [00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=742) Install it by default.

- [00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=744) This will allow you to git clone large repositories like 5 gigabyte, 10 gigabyte files having

- [00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=751) repositories.

- [00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=752) Okay, it is already installed.

- [00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=753) Now FFmpeg.

- [00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=754) This is super important.

- [00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=755) So, when I open a cmd and type FFmpeg, you see FFmpeg is not recognized.

- [00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=762) So, how am I going to install it?

- [00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=765) Click this link.

- [00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=766) This is the latest version.

- [00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=768) You can also manually find this link.

- [00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=770) How?

- [00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=771) Open a new tab and type download FFmpeg.

- [00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=773) You will go to its official website which is here.

- [00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=776) When I click here.

- [00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=777) Click Windows, click Windows builds by BtbN.

- [00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=783) In here you will see the latest link.

- [00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=785) So this link is from there basically.

- [00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=788) The FFmpeg is downloaded so I will extract it into the downloads folder.

- [00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=794) Okay, let's extract like this.

- [00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=796) I right-click it and extract.

- [00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=798) On Windows 11 you may be look for more options.

- [00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=801) So, the extracted folder is here.

- [00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=804) Enter inside binary folder and copy all these 3 exe files or cut them.

- [00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=810) Move back into your C drive.

- [00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=813) Make a new folder as FFmpeg_exes or whatever the name.

- [00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=818) Do not put any space character.

- [00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=820) Okay, so this is my FFmpeg exe path.

- [00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=824) So, when I click here, I will ctrl-C or right-click and copy.

- [00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=829) I will open the environment variables one more time.

- [00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=832) Click environment variables: go to the path in system variables or user variables.

- [00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=839) Doesn't matter.

- [00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=840) If you have multiple user accounts, install it into the system variables path.

- [00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=844) Edit: click new, paste it.

- [00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=848) Alternatively, you can also click new, click browse, and in here, select its folder from

- [00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=855) C drive.

- [00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=856) FFmpeg_exe: okay, it is added, okay.

- [00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=858) By the way, the system will look starting from top to the bottom.

- [00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=863) So wherever it finds at the top, it will use it.

- [00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=867) If you have multiple Python versions, the very top will get used by default.

- [00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=872) Okay.

- [00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=873) Click okay.

- [00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=874) Click okay.

- [00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=875) Click okay.

- [00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=876) After that, open a new cmd command line and type FFmpeg and you see.

- [00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=880) We got the latest version of FFmpeg by default installed into our system and it supports

- [00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=888) all of the libraries of FFmpeg.

- [00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=890) This is the latest and biggest version of FFmpeg.

- [00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=893) Okay, we got the FFmpeg too.

- [00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=896) Now time to install CUDA libraries.

- [00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=898) To download and install CUDA libraries, you need to register a free Nvidia developer account.

- [00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=906) Let's click Windows.

- [00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=907) Actually, they changed it.

- [00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=909) Wow!

- [00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=910) Nice.

- [00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=911) So, let's click exe, and download.

- [00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=913) Previously they were asking you to log in, but looks like they changed it.

- [00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=917) Alternatively, you can also download from this link that I have uploaded into Hugging

- [00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=922) Face repository.

- [00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=923) So, from either this link or from here, you can download it.

- [00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=927) Okay, so the download has been completed.

- [00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=929) Let's open the folder, right-click, and run as administrator.

- [00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=933) If you have multiple CUDA installations, the system may get confused about which one to

- [00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=940) use, so I suggest you to uninstall previous ones and install whatever the version that

- [00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=945) you need.

- [00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=946) You can also find other CUDA versions very easily, so all you need to do is type CUDA

- [00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=954) Toolkit and archive and it will allow you to look through all of the CUDA versions as

- [00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=961) you are seeing right now.

- [00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=962) You can download and install any version that is necessary, but I suggest you to install

- [00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=968) and have CUDA 11.8 version right now.

- [00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=972) In future, it may get changed, but currently most of the AI libraries most of the AI applications

- [00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=978) are using this version, but let's see, it should still allow me to install.

- [00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=983) So, I click custom advanced click yes.

- [00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=986) Okay, everything is selected.

- [00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=988) Click next.

- [00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=989) This is where it will get installed by default: C program files, Nvidia GPU computing toolkit,

- [00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=995) CUDA and version.

- [00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=996) Okay, let's click everything and next.

- [00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=998) All right.

- [00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=999) The installation is starting.

- [00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=1001) Okay, the installation has been completed.

- [00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=1003) Click next and close.

- [00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=1005) After that, let's open the system environment variables one more time and let's see if there

- [00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=1010) is anything new.

- [00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=1012) Let's open the path and now you see the CUDA is added into the very top of my system variables

- [00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=1020) path.

- [00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=1021) So, when any program looks for CUDA toolkit CUDA libraries, it will look into these two

- [00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=1028) folders and that is very nice.

- [00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=1029) Okay, it is set up.

- [00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=1032) We got the CUDA installed, we got the Git installed, and now it is time to learn about

- [00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=1037) git checkout, git pull, git stash, git stash pop.

- [00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=1040) So I will install Automatic1111 Stable Diffusion web UI.

- [00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=1044) Let's type Automatic1111 web UI.

- [00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=1047) Okay, let's go to the repository, let's copy its URL and let's open back our C drive.

- [00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=1055) I suggest you to install directly into your any drive, not install into documents, pictures,

- [00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=1061) downloads, wherever, install into C, D, G, directly into any drive.

- [00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=1066) So, let's open a new cmd in this drive.

- [00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=1069) So, you see how I have opened the cmd inside this folder, then type git clone, copy-paste

- [00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=1076) the URL and hit enter and it will clone the repository into your C drive.

- [00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=1083) Enter inside it.

- [00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=1084) Now I will start another cmd inside this drive.

- [00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=1087) So, I open cmd here.

- [00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=1089) Then now I am in this folder.

- [00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=1091) This is where your folder is currently located.

- [00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=1095) Now I can do many operations.

- [00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=1097) For example, let's do git checkout dev.

- [00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=1100) Now we are into the development branch and what is it you may wonder.

- [00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=1105) Currently there are 14 branches of Automatic1111 web UI.

- [00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=1109) When you click branches you will see that when they were last time updated.

- [00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=1114) So, the last time updated development branch was five days ago.

- [00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=1118) There is also Gradio 4 branch, Test fp8 branch and there is release candidate branch.

- [00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=1124) When I click dev branch you will see that it is 468 commits ahead of the main branch.

- [00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=1132) So, this branch has 468 improvements / fixes over the main branch.

- [00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=1140) After I checked out this branch I can do git pull to verify it is latest version and it

- [00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=1144) is latest version.

- [00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=1145) So, this is how you update a branch.

- [00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=1147) Let's return back to main branch.

- [00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=1150) So, git checkout main.

- [00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=1152) Okay, there is no main branch so git checkout master.

- [00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=1157) Sometimes people are preferring main, sometimes they are preferring master so you see the

- [00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=1161) master branch is the default branch.

- [00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=1164) Now let's see the other ones.

- [00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=1166) Git stash.

- [00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=1167) So, when is git stash and git stash pop are useful.

- [00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=1171) To be it useful you need to have a repository that is updated and you have conflicting files.

- [00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=1177) To show you that I will do this.

- [00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=1179) I will clone my repository.

- [00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=1181) This is my own repository.

- [00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=1183) By the way, you should also fork it.

- [00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=1186) Star it, open notifications and if you sponsor for me I would appreciate it very much.

- [00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=1191) So, let's refresh this.

- [00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=1193) Okay, let's copy it, let's go back to our C drive and let's open a cmd, type git clone

- [00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=1199) and copy paste the URL.

- [00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=1200) For copy pasting it.

- [00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=1201) I right-click.

- [00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=1202) You can also alternatively right-click here and paste from here.

- [00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=1205) So, let's clone it.

- [00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=1207) Okay, it is getting cloned and in this repository I will change something and then I will make

- [00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=1215) an update to my repository and I will do git pull.

- [00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=1217) Let me show you what I mean.

- [00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=1218) So, open it here.

- [00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=1220) So, this is how I open git pull and you see, you see it says already up-to-date.

- [00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=1226) Then I will change the readme file.

- [00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=1229) Okay, for changing it, let's open it with notepad here.

- [00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=1234) Okay, and in here what should we change.

- [00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=1238) Strategies ok, I will type it like this.

- [00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=1241) Then I will make an update to my repository.

- [00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=1245) Let me do update on my computer.

- [00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=1247) Okay, I did an update to repository.

- [00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=1250) Let's refresh it.

- [00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=1251) So, when I click this commits you see it was just now and I changed the update readme file.

- [00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=1258) I just added a new keyword here.

- [00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=1260) Now when I say git pull let's see what happens.

- [00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=1264) Okay, it says that please commit your changes or stash them before you merge.

- [00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=1271) Because there is a confliction of the files.

- [00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=1275) The updated file and my modified file are conflicting.

- [00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=1279) This is when it is useful to have.

- [00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=1282) So, what I am going to do is I will do git stash and it will save my modified file.

- [00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=1289) Then I will do git pull.

- [00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=1291) You see now it is updated.

- [00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=1293) The file is changed.

- [00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=1294) Now when I open the readme file let's open it again with notepad.

- [00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=1299) You see my changes is gone and it is updated to latest version.

- [00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=1304) However, I want my modification to be back.

- [00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=1307) So, what I need to do is, I will do git stash pop, and it will return back my original file,

- [00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=1314) modified readme.md.

- [00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=1315) So, when I open back it, I will see that it is returned back to the my version.

- [00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=1321) So, you see, my 'ok' word, which I have written here, is back, and 'new' is still here.

- [00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=1328) So, it pulled my change and merged it with the newest file as you are seeing right now.

- [00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=1334) This is when it is useful.

- [00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=1336) Okay, this is a complicated stuff, but sometimes you may be in need of that.

- [00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=1342) Now, what else do we need?

- [00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=1344) We have shown the git checkout, git pull, git clone, git stash.

- [00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=1349) Okay, now time to how to activate a virtual environment, how to make a virtual environment,

- [00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=1355) how to uninstall and install a specific library.

- [00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=1358) So, for installing Stable Diffusion Automatic1111 Web UI, I will double-click and start webui-user.bat

- [00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=1365) file, and this file will automatically generate a virtual environment.

- [00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=1370) So, theoretically in your AI application, sometimes you may be needed to modify certain

- [00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=1377) library, and in such cases, you need to update its generated virtual environment and make

- [00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=1386) the changes.

- [00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=1387) So, how we are going to do that?

- [00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=1389) Currently, it is downloading this Torch version into our virtual environment, and it will

- [00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=1394) install all of the libraries.

- [00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=1396) After installation has been completed, I will change the installed Torch version.

- [00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=1401) Currently, Automatic1111 Web UI installer is installing the Torch version 2.0.1.

- [00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=1407) After the installation has been completed, I will activate the virtual environment folder,

- [00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=1413) and I will install the Torch version 2.1, the latest version.

- [00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=1418) You will see how I am going to do it.

- [00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=1420) Okay, the installation has been completed.

- [00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=1421) Obviously, since this is a virtual machine, and it is not a bare-metal virtual machine,

- [00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=1427) it is not able to access the GPU, but it is not important.

- [00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=1431) Now, I will show how to activate the virtual environment of Automatic1111 Web UI.

- [00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=1437) It doesn't matter on any application that generates its own virtual environment.

- [00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=1443) The procedure is the same.

- [00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=1445) So enter inside scripts, this is the folder where you need to start the cmd like this:

- [00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=1450) inside virtual environment, inside scripts, type activate, and now it is activated.

- [00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=1456) Whatever the changes you make will only be effective in this virtual environment, not

- [00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=1462) in any other of virtual environments or in your system-wide Python installation.

- [00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=1467) So, let's install the latest Torch.

- [00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=1469) I type PyTorch.

- [00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=1471) Let's go to PyTorch website, and you see the latest version is 2.1.1.

- [00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=1475) So, I copied this link, and so first I will uninstall Torch, Torch Vision, and Torch Audio.

- [00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=1484) To do that, pip uninstall torch, torchvision and torchaudio and then type --yes, and it

- [00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=1492) will uninstall the currently installed Torch versions.

- [00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=1497) Then, I will first modify the copied command like this, and I will change the version to

- [00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=1505) the specific version.

- [00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=1507) If you want to see all of the versions, type like this, and then it will show you all of

- [00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=1512) the available versions.

- [00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=1513) Currently, these are all the available versions, as you are seeing right now.

- [00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=1516) So, let's install a specific version.

- [00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=1520) These are all for CUDA 11.8, you see, at the end, it shows this is for CUDA 11.8.

- [00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=1526) So, which version do we want to install?

- [00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=1529) So, let's install 2.1.0 and type, and it will install the Torch 2.1.0 with GPU support.

- [00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=1537) Why?

- [00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=1538) Because we are providing an index URL.

- [00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=1541) You see, this is why this Torch installation will have GPU support.

- [00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=1548) If you don't provide this index URL, it will install Torch only for CPU.

- [00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=1553) It will not install it for GPU.

- [00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=1555) So, this index URL has to be provided for Torch to be installed with GPU support.

- [00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=1562) Alternatively, let's say you want to install an older version.

- [00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=1565) So, what you need to do, let's cancel this, and let's return back to this, and change

- [00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=1571) the CUDA version, like 11.3.

- [00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=1574) Now, it will list me CUDA version 11.3 compatible Torch versions.

- [00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=1581) You see, 1.11.0.

- [00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=1583) By the way, this is also depending on your Python version.

- [00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=1587) Some libraries will not be compatible with all of the Pythons.

- [00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=1592) If you are not seeing a specific version that you need, then it is also meaning that your

- [00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=1597) Python version is not compatible with your library version.

- [00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=1601) Currently, the Python version of this virtual environment is 3.10.11.

- [00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=1605) Okay.

- [00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=1606) So how can you also compose a virtual environment?

- [00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=1610) Let's open a folder inside here.

- [00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=1612) Let's open a new cmd, so I will type Python -m venv and the folder name of venv venv.

- [00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=1619) Okay, it is now vevnv, and you see, it is generated.

- [00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=1624) This will be generated with your default Python.

- [00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=1627) Let's say my default Python is 3.10.11.

- [00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=1629) What if you want to have multiple Pythons?

- [00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=1633) Okay, let's also download Python 3.11.

- [00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=1637) You can't have multiple Pythons of the same version like Python 3.10.5 or Python 3.10.7,

- [00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=1644) but you can have multiple different major versions.

- [00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=1648) So, this is Python 3.11, and from here, let's download the Windows installer.

- [00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=1655) Okay, let's install it.

- [00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=1657) I will not add it to the path, so it will not conflict with my 3.10.

- [00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=1663) Let's customize next.

- [00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=1665) Okay, install everything.

- [00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=1667) I am not adding it to the environment variables.

- [00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=1669) This is important.

- [00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=1670) Otherwise, I have to change the environment variable order.

- [00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=1673) Okay, this is 10.11 like this: Okay, install.

- [00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=1679) Okay, the installation has been completed.

- [00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=1682) Let's open our environment variables.

- [00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=1685) From here, let's look at the environment variables, and we will not see that Python in our path.

- [00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=1693) You see, Python 3.11 is not here.

- [00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=1696) So, when I type cmd and type Python, I should still get 3.10.11, not 3.11.

- [00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=1703) So, how can I utilize Python 11 version?

- [00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=1707) Enter inside Python 11, right-click the exe file while keep hitting the shift key, and

- [00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=1714) you see there is Copy as path.

- [00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=1716) Copy it, and let's enter inside this folder, type cmd.

- [00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=1721) This time, I will copy-paste the path of the specific Python version like this.

- [00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=1726) You see, it also has a quotation mark, and I will type -m venv, and let's say 3.11 venv

- [00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=1734) like this, or let's say venv 3.11, and hit enter, and it will generate a virtual environment

- [00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=1742) based on this Python version installation.

- [00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=1745) Now, let's move into a new folder.

- [00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=1748) For moving into folders, type cd, type venv, hit tab, and it will auto-complete the name

- [00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=1754) like this.

- [00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=1755) You see, I am hitting the tab key, then move into the scripts, type activate, and let's

- [00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=1760) type Python --version, and you see the virtual environment.

- [00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=1766) Python version is 3.11, or let's say, just type Python, and now it is also 3.11 as you

- [00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=1772) are seeing.

- [00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=1773) You can also change your default Python version.

- [00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=1776) Let's open the environment variables, click environment variables, click edit path and

- [00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=1782) in here, click new, then click browse.

- [00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=1786) Select the Python 11 from here, 3.11, then also click new, and click browse, and then

- [00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=1795) go to the 3.11, and in here, you need to select scripts.

- [00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=1800) Okay.

- [00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=1801) You see, now we have two of them.

- [00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=1803) Let's move this to the up version like this, this, and these two, and will it be okay,

- [00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=1808) will it be sufficient?

- [00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=1810) Let's see.

- [00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=1811) Python.

- [00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=1812) And no, still, 3.10 is default.

- [00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=1815) Why?

- [00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=1816) Because the order of the environment path variables matters.

- [00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=1821) So, I edit.

- [00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=1822) I will move these to the very top like this, then also move this to the very top like this.

- [00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=1828) Okay, click.

- [00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=1829) Okay, okay, then open a new cmd.

- [00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=1832) You need to open a new one.

- [00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=1833) Type Python.

- [00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=1835) And now, my main Python.

- [00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=1837) My default Python is 3.11.

- [00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=1839) This is how you can set up multiple Pythons.

- [00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=1843) This is how you can add, modify, change, path, change your default applications.

- [00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=1849) This is also the same for runpodctl.

- [00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=1852) Runpodctl is the utility that we use for RunPod.

- [00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=1856) If you are following my RunPod tutorials, you will know that.

- [00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=1858) So, we need to first download the runpodctl.

- [00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=1863) How am I going to do that?

- [00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=1865) So, let's copy this.

- [00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=1866) Let's open a new folder inside C. Let's say runpodctl_exe.

- [00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=1872) Open a new cmd inside this folder.

- [00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=1876) Copy-paste the link.

- [00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=1877) Okay, if there is no wget on Windows.

- [00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=1880) So, we need to just download this file from here actually.

- [00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=1886) It will download a file like this.

- [00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=1889) Okay, let's say download suspicious file.

- [00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=1893) Let's open it, and I will cut it.

- [00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=1895) Return back into the runpodctl_exe.

- [00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=1899) Let's name it as runpodctl.exe like this.

- [00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=1903) Let's open a new environment variable.

- [00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=1905) Currently, when I type cmd and type runpodctl, you see, it is not recognized.

- [00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=1910) So, I go to environment variables.

- [00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=1912) I go to path, edit, click new, and click browse.

- [00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=1917) Let's select the runpodctl from here.

- [00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=1921) Okay, okay okay okay.

- [00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=1923) Let's open a new CMD.

- [00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=1925) And when I now type runpodctl, you see, now it is by default.

- [00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=1930) So now, I can use runpodctl.

- [00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=1932) This is the logic of pathing in Windows.

- [00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=1935) This is super important to learn and understand.

- [00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=1939) I will update this file as it be necessary.

- [00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=1941) The link to this file will be in the description of the video and also in the comment section

- [00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=1946) of the video.

- [00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=2007) You can also purchase our Udemy course, but I suggest you become a Patreon member and

- [00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=2014) follow our YouTube channel.

- [00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=2016) That is better.

- [00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=2017) But if you don't have any other options, you can purchase my Udemy course and access the

- [00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=2023) scripts there.

- [00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=2024) However, Patreon is the most up-to-date way, and you can follow me on Twitter.

- [00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=2028) I hope you have enjoyed this tutorial, hopefully much more amazing tutorials are coming and

- [00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=2035) hopefully, they will help you significantly.

- [00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=2037) For example, I am going to make a tutorial for Magic Animate Automatic Installer and

- [00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=2044) how to use it.

- [00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=2045) This tutorial was mandatory for that tutorial because you had to install C++ tools and FFmpeg.

- [00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=2051) This is why I recorded this tutorial previously, but this is a major tutorial.

- [00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=2055) This tutorial will help you significantly if you are interested in AI overall.

- [00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=2056) Thank you very much.

- [00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjNy7afOQ0&t=2057) See you later hopefully.
