- [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKDeMdEObNo&t=0) Greetings, everyone. In this video, I am&nbsp; going to introduce you to the latest Stability&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKDeMdEObNo&t=5) AI-released Stable Cascade model. The weights are&nbsp; released. I know that there is Stable Diffusion 3,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKDeMdEObNo&t=12) but its weights are not released. Its&nbsp; models are not released yet. Therefore,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKDeMdEObNo&t=18) today I am going to show you how to&nbsp; use this amazing model. The weights,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKDeMdEObNo&t=23) the models published by&nbsp; Stability AI. It is called&nbsp;as

- [00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKDeMdEObNo&t=28) Stable Cascade, and it is really amazing. We have&nbsp; developed an amazing Gradio application for this&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKDeMdEObNo&t=34) model. So this model right now works on even 5GB&nbsp; VRAM-having GPUs. Even on older GPUs. Therefore,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKDeMdEObNo&t=43) even if you have a low VRAM-having GPU, you will&nbsp; be able to use this amazing model both locally,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKDeMdEObNo&t=51) and if you don't have any GPU, you will be able&nbsp; to use it on the cloud. Because we also have cloud&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKDeMdEObNo&t=58) installers. We also have a Kaggle notebook. So you&nbsp; can use this on your computer or on the cloud as&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKDeMdEObNo&t=65) you wish. So in this video, I am going to show&nbsp; you how to install this amazing application,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKDeMdEObNo&t=72) Stable Cascade application, on RunPod, on&nbsp; Massed Compute, and on a free Kaggle account.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKDeMdEObNo&t=80) I have also published a video for Windows.&nbsp; So if you are interested in Windows usage,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKDeMdEObNo&t=86) you can follow that video. But it is so simple.&nbsp; For Windows, you just double-click the .bat files.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKDeMdEObNo&t=92) Installing on RunPod and on Massed Compute is&nbsp; also very easy and straightforward. You just&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKDeMdEObNo&t=100) need to execute a command. Everything is written&nbsp; in the instructions file. The Kaggle notebook is&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKDeMdEObNo&t=105) also very straightforward. So in this video, I am&nbsp; going to show you how to install Stable Cascade&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKDeMdEObNo&t=112) on these cloud platforms. So the application&nbsp; that we have developed for Stable Cascade is&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKDeMdEObNo&t=118) amazing. It includes all the features that you&nbsp; need. It supports multi-line prompting. You see,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKDeMdEObNo&t=123) each line is treated as a separate prompt.&nbsp; It supports negative prompts. It supports 275&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKDeMdEObNo&t=130) different styles. So you can generate images&nbsp; in any style that you wish. It supports loop&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKDeMdEObNo&t=136) all styles. This is a very necessary feature&nbsp; if you want to test all of the styles on your&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKDeMdEObNo&t=141) prompt and see which one is performing best. It&nbsp; supports randomized seed. It supports different&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKDeMdEObNo&t=147) resolutions. It supports batch size and also the&nbsp; number of images to generate. So you can generate&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKDeMdEObNo&t=152) 100 images, 200 images with your prompts as you&nbsp; wish. It supports CFG values for prior guidance&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKDeMdEObNo&t=159) scale and decoder guidance scale. Stable Cascade&nbsp; works with two steps. It is prior steps and also&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKDeMdEObNo&t=166) decoder steps. There are also prior inference&nbsp; steps and decoder inference steps. So the guidance&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKDeMdEObNo&t=172) scale determines how much it should follow the&nbsp; prompt, and the steps, as we know, how many steps&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKDeMdEObNo&t=178) it will take to render the image. Moreover, this&nbsp; application saves the metadata of every generated&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKDeMdEObNo&t=186) image. So you can load any image from your output,&nbsp; and you can see the metadata of that image like&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKDeMdEObNo&t=196) this. It also allows you to load and set metadata&nbsp; settings with one click. So all the settings that&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKDeMdEObNo&t=202) you have used to generate that image will be&nbsp; loaded here. So how are we going to install this&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKDeMdEObNo&t=208) amazing application on Massed Compute, RunPod,&nbsp; Linux, and Kaggle? To download the application,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKDeMdEObNo&t=215) go to the very bottom of this post. The link&nbsp; to this post will be in the description of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKDeMdEObNo&t=219) video. Click this attachment zip file and extract&nbsp; it anywhere you want. So let's extract it into&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKDeMdEObNo&t=226) our G drive. Okay, right-click, extract.&nbsp; When you enter inside the extracted folder,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKDeMdEObNo&t=232) you will see all the instructions files here. I&nbsp; am going to start with Massed Compute because it&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKDeMdEObNo&t=237) is the very best one. So let's open the Massed&nbsp; Compute instructions. You see, I already have&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKDeMdEObNo&t=243) a video tutorial for Massed Compute. You can also&nbsp; watch this, but this video will also cover that.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKDeMdEObNo&t=248) Please register for Massed Compute by using this&nbsp; link. This is super important. Then you need to&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKDeMdEObNo&t=254) set your billing, and then you are ready to start&nbsp; initializing your virtual machine. Massed Compute&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKDeMdEObNo&t=261) runs on a cloud server, so it will not run on your&nbsp; computer, but we will be able to use it as if it&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKDeMdEObNo&t=267) is our own computer. From here, select RTX A6000&nbsp; GPU. This is the very best price-performance GPU.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKDeMdEObNo&t=275) Select the creator from the category, select&nbsp; SECourses. This is our image, and we have a&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKDeMdEObNo&t=281) special code to reduce the price significantly.&nbsp; So you see the current price is 62 cents per hour,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKDeMdEObNo&t=289) and it is giving us a 48-gigabyte VRAM-having&nbsp; GPU and RAM-having computer with storage 256&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKDeMdEObNo&t=297) gigabytes. After I click verify, you will see&nbsp; that the price has become 31 cents. So this deal&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKDeMdEObNo&t=304) is amazing. It is half the price of RunPod with a&nbsp; more amazing platform, more amazing computers. So&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKDeMdEObNo&t=312) click deploy. After you clicked deploy, you need&nbsp; to wait for this part to be initialized. To use&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKDeMdEObNo&t=318) Massed Compute, we need ThinLinc. To download&nbsp; ThinLinc, click this link here, and it will&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKDeMdEObNo&t=324) lead you to this link. Click "Allow all," and&nbsp; based on your operating system, either Windows,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKDeMdEObNo&t=329) Mac, or Linux, download it. So I am on Windows,&nbsp; so I'm going to click to download this. Then just&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKDeMdEObNo&t=335) click the downloaded installer, click yes. Then&nbsp; all you need to do is just click next, accept&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKDeMdEObNo&t=341) terms, click next, next, install, nothing else.&nbsp; It is so straightforward. Then run the ThinLinc

- [00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKDeMdEObNo&t=347) client. Okay. In this screen, there is a very&nbsp; important thing. What is it? To transfer files&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKDeMdEObNo&t=353) between ThinLinc and our computer, we click these&nbsp; advanced options first. So this screen opens,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKDeMdEObNo&t=359) click options. In the local devices, you need&nbsp; to add a drive so that you can transfer files,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKDeMdEObNo&t=365) click details. Currently, this drive is&nbsp; added. So I will re-add it, click remove,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKDeMdEObNo&t=370) click add. From exported path, click this&nbsp; three-dots icon, select wherever the drive&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKDeMdEObNo&t=375) that you want for your files to be synchronized&nbsp; between your local computer and Massed Compute.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKDeMdEObNo&t=382) So I have a folder here, Massed Compute, click OK.&nbsp; If you want synchronization to be on both sides,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKDeMdEObNo&t=391) click read and write. If you select read-only,&nbsp; you will only be able to read the files from&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKDeMdEObNo&t=396) Massed Compute. If you also want to get the files&nbsp; from Massed Compute cloud, select read and write,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKDeMdEObNo&t=402) click OK, click OK. Then wait for this&nbsp; initializing to be completed. It shouldn't&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKDeMdEObNo&t=408) take too long. These machines are amazing. So the&nbsp; machine initialization has been completed. You see&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKDeMdEObNo&t=413) status running. Click this login IP address,&nbsp; paste it. You see it is only copying the IP,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKDeMdEObNo&t=420) username is already Ubuntu. Then click this&nbsp; password and paste it. Do not select end&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKDeMdEObNo&t=425) existing session unless you need it. This will&nbsp; restart the machine. You may need this only if&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKDeMdEObNo&t=432) you are having a synchronization problem with your&nbsp; folders. Click Connect. Then it will ask you this.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKDeMdEObNo&t=437) Click Continue. Then you will get to this screen.&nbsp; Click Start. You see it is mounting local drives.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKDeMdEObNo&t=443) So we will be able to synchronize between folders&nbsp; between the ThinLinc on the Massed Compute cloud&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKDeMdEObNo&t=450) machine and on our local computer. So to run&nbsp; this, you don't need any graphical interface.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKDeMdEObNo&t=456) You don't need any powerful CPU. You don't need&nbsp; any powerful GPU. This will run on a cloud remote&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKDeMdEObNo&t=462) machine. So we need to first transfer installer&nbsp; files into Massed Compute. You can do that either&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKDeMdEObNo&t=468) by logging into your Patreon from this Chrome, or&nbsp; what you can do, you can synchronize files, which&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKDeMdEObNo&t=475) I am going to do. So I will go to the downloaded&nbsp; files inside Stable Cascade here. You see, I will&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKDeMdEObNo&t=482) copy this folder. Then I will go to my Massed&nbsp; Compute synchronization folder, which is here.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKDeMdEObNo&t=488) Massed Compute, paste it. After I do that, I will&nbsp; go to the home from here. Pay attention. In here&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKDeMdEObNo&t=495) You will see thindrives drives. When you click&nbsp; this, this is the folder on my computer that I am&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKDeMdEObNo&t=501) synchronizing. Enter inside it. Wait for files to&nbsp; be synchronized. Do not put very big files here.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKDeMdEObNo&t=507) Otherwise, it will take forever to synchronize. I&nbsp; saw that some people are running the instructions&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKDeMdEObNo&t=512) on this folder. It will not work. You need to copy&nbsp; this installer into your desktop. You see here,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKDeMdEObNo&t=519) paste it, then wait for it to be copied and&nbsp; pasted. You see it is right now copying,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKDeMdEObNo&t=524) copying 11 files to the desktop. Wait for it to&nbsp; be completed. It shouldn't take long, actually.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKDeMdEObNo&t=530) Then enter inside the copied folder. Currently, I&nbsp; have got some delay for some reason. It may happen&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKDeMdEObNo&t=536) sometimes. Okay. They are getting copied right&nbsp; now. Yeah. Some delay that I have. Okay. All files&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKDeMdEObNo&t=542) are copied and pasted. You see, I am inside&nbsp; home, desktop, Stable Cascade. So from here,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKDeMdEObNo&t=548) you just need to follow very simple commands.&nbsp; Open Massed Compute instructions, double-click it,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKDeMdEObNo&t=554) and you will get to this screen. Select this part,&nbsp; right-click and copy. This is the way I do all&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKDeMdEObNo&t=560) my installer scripts. So once you learn one of my&nbsp; installers, you can use all of them. Then in here,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKDeMdEObNo&t=566) click this three-dots icon, open terminal.&nbsp; You see, currently I am inside desktop, Stable&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKDeMdEObNo&t=571) Cascade, version 12, paste it and hit enter, and&nbsp; it will automatically install everything for you.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKDeMdEObNo&t=577) So the installation has been completed. It only&nbsp; took a few minutes. You will see this message once&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKDeMdEObNo&t=583) it is completed. Then all you need to do is return&nbsp; back to these instructions file, select this part,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKDeMdEObNo&t=590) right-click, copy, then return back to the folder&nbsp; where you have copied. You see, this is it. Home&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKDeMdEObNo&t=596) desktop, Stable Cascade, three dots icon, open&nbsp; terminal, right-click and paste. And then it&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKDeMdEObNo&t=603) will start the application. When you first time&nbsp; start it, it will download all of the models. We&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKDeMdEObNo&t=609) will see that in a moment. You can use this Gradio&nbsp; live share on your computer, on your mobile phone,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKDeMdEObNo&t=616) wherever you want. You see, I can access this on&nbsp; my computer, but you can also use it locally. How&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKDeMdEObNo&t=622) to use it. Just right-click and open this link.&nbsp; If you don't want it to start a URL like this with&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKDeMdEObNo&t=629) Gradio share, what you need to do is when you're&nbsp; copying this, you just need to delete this --share&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKDeMdEObNo&t=636) and it will not start Gradio live. So right now&nbsp; we can use this interface as we want. So let's&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKDeMdEObNo&t=642) generate a car image. Let's just generate and&nbsp; it will download all of the models. You see, the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKDeMdEObNo&t=648) download speed is just amazing. 250 megabytes per&nbsp; second. So this is almost 2 gigabits per second.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKDeMdEObNo&t=657) So it will not take a lot of time. You cannot&nbsp; get this speed on RunPod or on other platforms.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKDeMdEObNo&t=663) This is why Massed Compute is the number one&nbsp; cloud service provider right now. And when it&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKDeMdEObNo&t=668) downloads multiple files, the download speed is&nbsp; even more amazing. It reaches to 6 gigabits per&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKDeMdEObNo&t=674) second. When it is downloading multiple files&nbsp; at the same time, it is just mind-blowing. So&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKDeMdEObNo&t=680) this download process will take at most a few&nbsp; minutes on Massed Compute and the image has&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKDeMdEObNo&t=686) been generated. It was very fast. So you see, it&nbsp; is ready here. If you don't know how to use this&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKDeMdEObNo&t=692) application and if you are wondering about it,&nbsp; you can watch the Windows tutorial where I have&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKDeMdEObNo&t=697) explained it in detail how to use the application.&nbsp; However, I am going to show you how you can copy&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKDeMdEObNo&t=704) and transfer the generated files to your local&nbsp; computer or your local device. Since currently&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKDeMdEObNo&t=711) this is running on a desktop Ubuntu and I am&nbsp; at the local URL, not at the Gradio Live Share,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKDeMdEObNo&t=717) I can click this icon and it will open the outputs&nbsp; folder as you are seeing. So to transfer them to&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKDeMdEObNo&t=723) my computer, all I need to do is go back to the&nbsp; upper folder, click here and copy this, then click&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKDeMdEObNo&t=730) this home here. Then you will go to the thinlinc&nbsp; drives here, thin drives here, enter inside here&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKDeMdEObNo&t=737) and paste it. Once you have copied and pasted the&nbsp; folder, it will synchronize this with your device,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKDeMdEObNo&t=745) with your hard drive on your computer. So&nbsp; when I go back to my synchronization folder,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKDeMdEObNo&t=749) I will see that all the images generated on Massed&nbsp; Compute are also now here. So now I am going to&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKDeMdEObNo&t=757) start installing RunPod. RunPod installation&nbsp; is also very easy. Just double-click the RunPod&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKDeMdEObNo&t=763) instructions. Please register RunPod from this&nbsp; link. I appreciate it. It gives me credit so I&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKDeMdEObNo&t=768) can use them to generate more tutorials. And also,&nbsp; I have a how to use RunPod tutorial recently. Just&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKDeMdEObNo&t=774) double-click this link. Let's log in to RunPod,&nbsp; add your credits. Then once you have your credits,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKDeMdEObNo&t=780) all you need to do is click this Pods here. Let&nbsp; me zoom in, click deploy. I have several settings&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKDeMdEObNo&t=787) that I have made to get the very best Pods on&nbsp; RunPod. First of all, I use community cloud. It is&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKDeMdEObNo&t=793) cheaper. I select extreme speed here, then click&nbsp; this filter, select NVME, then select memory per&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKDeMdEObNo&t=801) GPU 48 gigabytes. So this will bring us very good&nbsp; Pods. For this application, you can use 3090 or&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKDeMdEObNo&t=808) you can use 4090. They are the very best inference&nbsp; speeds having GPUs. So I will go with 4090 for&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKDeMdEObNo&t=816) this tutorial. Then in here you need to select the&nbsp; PyTorch template. You can also use any template,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKDeMdEObNo&t=822) but I prefer the PyTorch template as it is&nbsp; easier. So type PyTorch and select 2.2.0.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKDeMdEObNo&t=830) Then you need to edit your template and make the&nbsp; volume disk like 50 gigabytes. Set overrides,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKDeMdEObNo&t=835) click deploy on demand, then go to my Pods. Just&nbsp; wait for this connect button to appear. So this&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKDeMdEObNo&t=843) template is very famous. So it gets downloaded&nbsp; from cache, quickly appeared connect button, click&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKDeMdEObNo&t=850) connect to JupyterLab, wait for this screen to&nbsp; be loaded. Sometimes you may get stuck with this&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKDeMdEObNo&t=856) screen so close all of your browsers and start&nbsp; again. I also suggest you to use Chrome. It is&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKDeMdEObNo&t=863) the best browser to use with these applications.&nbsp; Then return back to wherever you have extracted&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKDeMdEObNo&t=869) files. Drag and drop all of them here. You can&nbsp; also use this upload icon to select all the files.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKDeMdEObNo&t=875) Then double-click the RunPod instructions here.&nbsp; Select this part. This part is the installer.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKDeMdEObNo&t=882) Open a new terminal from plus terminal. Wait for&nbsp; this terminal to open, then copy-paste it like&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKDeMdEObNo&t=888) this. Then just wait for the installation to be&nbsp; completed. This machine should be pretty strong&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKDeMdEObNo&t=894) because we have set the very powerful settings.&nbsp; We can also see that it has amazing download and&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKDeMdEObNo&t=901) upload speeds. However, RunPod is still very slow&nbsp; compared to Massed Compute when you are installing&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKDeMdEObNo&t=907) or their hard drives are very slow as well.&nbsp; You see even on this very powerful machine, the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKDeMdEObNo&t=913) download speed when installing is very slow. This&nbsp; is why I prefer Massed Compute for cloud usage. So&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKDeMdEObNo&t=922) the installation has been completed. It took way&nbsp; more than Massed Compute. To start it we are going&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKDeMdEObNo&t=928) to copy this entirely, open a new terminal, paste&nbsp; it hit enter. You can also use this application&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKDeMdEObNo&t=936) with RunPod proxy to use that you need to have&nbsp; port opened. So actually, I'm also going to show&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKDeMdEObNo&t=942) that stop this pod like this. You can do that&nbsp; in the beginning as well. Export 7861 port. Save&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKDeMdEObNo&t=951) start again. So then click Connect. Click Connect&nbsp; to JupyterLab. You see we will be able to connect&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKDeMdEObNo&t=957) to the 7861 port. Okay, open a terminal. Let's&nbsp; also open the instructions again. We don't need&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKDeMdEObNo&t=965) to reinstall. We just need to copy this. Open&nbsp; a terminal, paste it, hit enter. Then we will&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKDeMdEObNo&t=971) be able to both connect with Gradio live share&nbsp; and with the proxy of RunPod. So let's connect&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKDeMdEObNo&t=977) with the proxy. Just click this. It will open with&nbsp; proxy. Also, you can use with Gradio live share.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKDeMdEObNo&t=983) Gradio live share usually works better than the&nbsp; proxy of RunPod because the RunPod proxy is broken&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKDeMdEObNo&t=989) recently. Yes, you see it's broken right now. So I&nbsp; will use with Gradio live share. I will try to fix&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKDeMdEObNo&t=995) this. If it is possible, just type something, hit&nbsp; generate. When you first time generate something,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKDeMdEObNo&t=1002) it will download all the models as you are seeing&nbsp; right now. So we just need to wait. The speed is&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKDeMdEObNo&t=1007) decent when downloading a big file, but when&nbsp; installing it is very slow. It looks like our&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKDeMdEObNo&t=1012) Gradio version is not up to date. I will try to&nbsp; update and see if it is not broken. I will update&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKDeMdEObNo&t=1019) it when you are watching this video. So the proxy&nbsp; should also work. Even though the first model file&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKDeMdEObNo&t=1025) has been downloaded, it is not able to move to the&nbsp; second file. It is taking a huge amount of time.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKDeMdEObNo&t=1031) RunPod has huge issues recently and they still&nbsp; didn't fix these issues even though I have&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKDeMdEObNo&t=1036) reported them. So I suggest you to move your&nbsp; workflow to Massed Compute if possible. Even&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKDeMdEObNo&t=1043) though download of all models have been completed,&nbsp; it is still trying to load the model into the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKDeMdEObNo&t=1050) GPU and it is taking a huge amount of time. The&nbsp; RunPod hard drives are really problematic right&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKDeMdEObNo&t=1055) now. So each hard drive related operation is&nbsp; taking a huge amount of time as you are seeing&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKDeMdEObNo&t=1060) right now. All right. The first image has been&nbsp; generated. Let's look at all the styles. We have&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKDeMdEObNo&t=1066) 275 styles. If you don't know how to use this&nbsp; application, you can watch the Windows tutorial&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKDeMdEObNo&t=1072) where I have explained it in detail. You see in&nbsp; here when I click this button, it will not work&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKDeMdEObNo&t=1079) because this is not running on a desktop operating&nbsp; system. It is running on a cloud machine. However,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKDeMdEObNo&t=1086) all the images are already being saved in the&nbsp; outputs folder and you see this is the speed of&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKDeMdEObNo&t=1093) the RTX 4090 on RunPod. When we enter inside&nbsp; the Stable Cascade folder inside outputs, we&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKDeMdEObNo&t=1100) will be able to open all of the generated images&nbsp; with all of the styles that are being generated&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKDeMdEObNo&t=1108) right now. You can watch the progress here. It&nbsp; will show that 3 over 276 is generated. The one&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKDeMdEObNo&t=1116) extra one is coming from no style. So you can&nbsp; watch the process here. You can see the prompts&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKDeMdEObNo&t=1122) that are being used. So how you can download all&nbsp; of these images. You can download all of these&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKDeMdEObNo&t=1128) images with the RunPodCTL command or right-click&nbsp; and download. And the easiest way is right-click&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKDeMdEObNo&t=1136) the outputs folder and download as an archive&nbsp; with this way you will be able to download all&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKDeMdEObNo&t=1142) of the images as a zip file. You can also click&nbsp; the generated images here and the download icon in&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKDeMdEObNo&t=1149) there. So if you don't know how to use RunPodCTL&nbsp; in our channel page on YouTube type in the search&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKDeMdEObNo&t=1155) bar RunPodCTL and you will get all the tutorials&nbsp; where I have explained RunPodCTL. This is the main&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKDeMdEObNo&t=1162) tutorial for RunPod. You can watch this video&nbsp; to learn how to use RunPodCTL to download all&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKDeMdEObNo&t=1168) the files onto your computer pretty fast. But&nbsp; download as an archive also works pretty decently&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKDeMdEObNo&t=1177) and we can see all the images that are being&nbsp; generated. So as a last step, I am going to&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKDeMdEObNo&t=1182) show how to use the Kaggle notebook that we have&nbsp; made. To be able to use the Kaggle notebook you&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKDeMdEObNo&t=1188) need to log in to your Kaggle account. It is free&nbsp; to register. Make sure that you have verified your&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKDeMdEObNo&t=1195) phone number otherwise you won't be able to use&nbsp; the GPUs on Kaggle. So let me show you click this&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKDeMdEObNo&t=1201) plus icon click new notebook and on this screen go&nbsp; to the file import notebook you can drag and drop&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKDeMdEObNo&t=1208) the file here or click browse files I will use&nbsp; the click browse files inside here we have the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKDeMdEObNo&t=1214) Kaggle Cascade version 3 import it. After you did&nbsp; import the notebook you will get to this screen.

- [00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKDeMdEObNo&t=1221) First of all make sure that you have selected&nbsp; accelerator GPU T4 x2 from here this is the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKDeMdEObNo&t=1227) best GPU on Kaggle right now. Make sure that&nbsp; internet is on then click this start session.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKDeMdEObNo&t=1234) If you are not seeing the accelerator option&nbsp; here that means that your Kaggle account is&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKDeMdEObNo&t=1239) not verified with a phone number. You&nbsp; have to verify it. The notebook is so&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKDeMdEObNo&t=1244) straightforward. Wait for the session to start. Okay, the session started. Once the session&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKDeMdEObNo&t=1249) started, when you click here, you will see these&nbsp; options. Then, execute the first cell. This will&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKDeMdEObNo&t=1255) install everything automatically for you on&nbsp; Kaggle. So, the Kaggle installation has been&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKDeMdEObNo&t=1260) completed. It was way faster than RunPod. You can&nbsp; scroll to the top and see the messages. This is&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKDeMdEObNo&t=1266) not important. It will work. If this notebook&nbsp; gets broken, just message me on Patreon and,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKDeMdEObNo&t=1272) hopefully, I will fix it for you. Since Kaggle is&nbsp; still not allowing to use the Gradio live share,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKDeMdEObNo&t=1279) I am not going to show this part. This part has&nbsp; full instructions. Just follow them and you will&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKDeMdEObNo&t=1285) be able to start and use the Gradio live share.&nbsp; When you follow this part, you will get a link&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKDeMdEObNo&t=1292) and then, once you have the link, you will start&nbsp; the application. Just I am going to show you right&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKDeMdEObNo&t=1298) now. Okay, I got the link. Then, I am going to&nbsp; execute this cell to start it. With our newest&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKDeMdEObNo&t=1305) optimizations, it is working amazing. You don't&nbsp; need to worry about anything. Just wait it to&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKDeMdEObNo&t=1311) start in the local URL. Once you see this message,&nbsp; open the link above you got and click the visit&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKDeMdEObNo&t=1318) site and you see Stable Cascade application that&nbsp; we have started on the Kaggle. Let's generate&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKDeMdEObNo&t=1324) something like car image. The usage is same as&nbsp; Windows or RunPod or Massed Compute. You can watch&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKDeMdEObNo&t=1331) the Windows tutorial to learn about everything,&nbsp; all of these options. When you first time generate&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKDeMdEObNo&t=1337) anything, it will download the models as usual.&nbsp; The download speed is super fast as you are seeing&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKDeMdEObNo&t=1342) right now. So, our first image on Kaggle has been&nbsp; generated. The Kaggle will be the slowest one&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKDeMdEObNo&t=1349) among all others because we are using free GPUs.&nbsp; However, it is free. They give you 30 hours of&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKDeMdEObNo&t=1357) GPU time every week, so you can use Kaggle for&nbsp; free 120 hours per month. It is just amazing,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKDeMdEObNo&t=1365) mind-blowing. The speed is, of course, slower but&nbsp; still very decent. If you don't have a strong GPU,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKDeMdEObNo&t=1372) you can use the Kaggle. You see, it is taking&nbsp; around one minute for per image with the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKDeMdEObNo&t=1378) default settings, so we already have generated few&nbsp; images. How you can download all of the generated&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKDeMdEObNo&t=1384) images at once? It is so easy. You need to click&nbsp; cancel run. You can start it again. Don't worry,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKDeMdEObNo&t=1391) it doesn't require reinstall. Just follow the&nbsp; above instructions. Then, all you need to do is&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKDeMdEObNo&t=1396) click this cell. This cell will generate a zip&nbsp; file in the working directory of Kaggle. When&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKDeMdEObNo&t=1402) you open the working directory, you see Kaggle&nbsp; Stable Cascade images zip. Just click three dots&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKDeMdEObNo&t=1407) icon and download and it will download all of&nbsp; the generated images for you. If you don't know&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKDeMdEObNo&t=1413) how to use Kaggle working directory, temporary&nbsp; directory, just type Kaggle and I have amazing&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKDeMdEObNo&t=1419) tutorials for Kaggle on the channel, so you can&nbsp; watch all of them and learn more about Kaggle,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKDeMdEObNo&t=1425) how to use Kaggle. Especially, I suggest you to&nbsp; watch this particular tutorial to learn more about&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKDeMdEObNo&t=1432) Kaggle. So, we have learned everything, but before&nbsp; we end this tutorial, I want to show you all of&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKDeMdEObNo&t=1440) the images generated on Massed Compute so far. So,&nbsp; let's open this folder. We already have a lot of&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKDeMdEObNo&t=1446) images. So, let's copy this folder and paste it&nbsp; back into our synchronization folder. Where was&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKDeMdEObNo&t=1454) it? It was inside thin drives, in here, and Massed&nbsp; Compute and then, let's copy-paste it. It will&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKDeMdEObNo&t=1462) ask you skip or merge. I will merge. Okay, I am&nbsp; going to say apply to all and skip because we had&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKDeMdEObNo&t=1468) copied already previously. Now, when I return&nbsp; back to my synchronization folder, I should&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKDeMdEObNo&t=1474) see that new images are appearing here one by&nbsp; one and yes, they are appearing. Let's make it&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKDeMdEObNo&t=1480) extra large icons. You see, we are getting amazing&nbsp; images with every style, so you can find your very&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKDeMdEObNo&t=1487) liked style with this way very easily. This is a&nbsp; feature that many of the major Gradio applications&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKDeMdEObNo&t=1495) that they are lacking. I am adding them because I&nbsp; am a user like you guys, so I am adding the most&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKDeMdEObNo&t=1501) demanded features by you and also used by me. You&nbsp; see, we are getting amazing images, amazing style&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKDeMdEObNo&t=1508) images like this one, very good one, very cool&nbsp; one or like this one, as you are seeing. So,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKDeMdEObNo&t=1514) this is a way of using this amazing Stable Cascade&nbsp; application. Hopefully, see you in another amazing&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKDeMdEObNo&t=1520) tutorial later. Thank you so much for supporting&nbsp; me and subscribing and sharing our channel.
