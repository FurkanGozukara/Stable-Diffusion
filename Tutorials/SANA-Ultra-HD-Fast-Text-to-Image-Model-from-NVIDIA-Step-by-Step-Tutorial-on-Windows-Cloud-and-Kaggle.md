Sana: Efficient High-Resolution Image Synthesis with Linear Diffusion Transformer

We introduce Sana, a text-to-image framework that can efficiently generate images up to 4096 √ó 4096 resolution. Sana can synthesize high-resolution, high-quality images with strong text-image alignment at a remarkably fast speed, deployable on laptop GPU. Core designs include:

(1) DC-AE: unlike traditional AEs, which compress images only 8√ó, we trained an AE that can compress images 32√ó, effectively reducing the number of latent tokens.

(2) Linear DiT: we replace all vanilla attention in DiT with linear attention, which is more efficient at high resolutions without sacrificing quality.

(3) Decoder-only text encoder: we replaced T5 with modern decoder-only small LLM as the text encoder and designed complex human instruction with in-context learning to enhance the image-text alignment.

(4) Efficient training and sampling: we propose Flow-DPM-Solver to reduce sampling steps, with efficient caption labeling and selection to accelerate convergence.

As a result, Sana-0.6B is very competitive with modern giant diffusion model (e.g. Flux-12B), being 20 times smaller and 100+ times faster in measured throughput. Moreover, Sana-0.6B can be deployed on a 16GB laptop GPU, taking less than 1 second to generate a 1024 √ó 1024 resolution image. Sana enables content creation at low cost.



### Video Transcription


- [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=0) Greetings everyone. Today I am going to introduce&nbsp; you text to image SANA model developed by the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=7) NVIDIA. The advantage of this model is that it&nbsp; is able to generate very high resolution images,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=14) 4 megapixel at the moment in a very short time&nbsp; with a low VRAM memory. So, it is an amazing model&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=23) to generate fast images at high resolution.&nbsp; This model is not supported widely yet,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=30) not even the ComfyUI is supporting its 4 megapixel&nbsp; resolution. However, I have developed a very&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=37) advanced Gradio application with one click to&nbsp; install on Windows and also use on cloud services&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=45) such as Massed Compute, RunPod, and even a free&nbsp; Kaggle account notebook. If you are a Linux user,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=52) you can use Massed Compute or RunPod installer as&nbsp; well. So, what are the features and the advantages&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=59) of my Gradio application, it is supporting the&nbsp; latest 4 megapixel SANA 2K model with its native&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=68) pipeline. Moreover, I have improved the pipeline&nbsp; so that it is doing offloading and working even on&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=78) lower VRAM GPUs very fast and very efficiently.&nbsp; Moreover, my Gradio application is supporting&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=84) multi line prompting, so you can write a prompt&nbsp; to the each line and it will generate each line&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=93) separately as a new prompt. Furthermore, my&nbsp; Gradio application has more advanced features&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=99) such as you can set the aspect ratio and it&nbsp; will set the accurate resolution immediately&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=106) accordingly. Moreover, it is supporting negative&nbsp; prompting, image styles, randomized seed,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=113) and batch size and number of generations. So, you&nbsp; can even generate three images at once or you can&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=120) set it to generate hundreds of images in a loop.&nbsp; All of these features are combined with multi&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=127) prompting and all of the images are saved in an&nbsp; properly set up outputs folder automatically. So,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=135) in the first part of this tutorial, I will&nbsp; show you how to install and use on Windows&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=141) and I will teach how to use this application.&nbsp; Then I will show how to use on Massed Compute,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=148) on a cloud service, if you don't have a powerful&nbsp; GPU, you can use Massed Compute, then I will&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=153) show on RunPod and finally I will show on a free&nbsp; Kaggle account, so if you don't want to pay any&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=160) money to any cloud services and if you don't have&nbsp; a powerful GPU, you can use this amazing model on&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=166) a free Kaggle account for free. So, as usual, I&nbsp; have prepared an amazing post where you will find&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=172) all of the instructions, links and the zip file.&nbsp; Please read this post from top to the bottom.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=180) You can download the latest zip file from&nbsp; the top or also from the very bottom where&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=185) the attachments are. So, what we need to be&nbsp; able to use the SANA on our Windows Computer,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=192) we need to have Python 3.10 installed, Cuda 12.4,&nbsp; cuDNN, C++ tools and Git. How to install them&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=202) has been explained in this amazing tutorial video&nbsp; step by step, so please follow that. This is only&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=209) one time mandatory, after that you will be able to&nbsp; use all of the AI applications perfectly fine. So,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=216) let's go to the bottom and download the zip file.&nbsp; As I said, please read the announcements, changes,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=222) updates, everything on this post before you begin&nbsp; installation and usage. How to install on RunPod,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=229) on Massed Compute and Kaggle will be shown&nbsp; after Windows tutorial part has been completed,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=235) but it is mandatory to watch the Windows tutorial&nbsp; part to learn how to use this amazing application.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=242) If you are a Linux user, you can use RunPod&nbsp; or Massed Compute installers to install on&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=247) your system because RunPod and Massed Compute are&nbsp; both Ubuntu Linux. Move the zip file into the disc&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=254) drive where you are going to install, I'm going&nbsp; to install into my Seagate. Extract the files,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=259) extract. Then make sure that your folder does not&nbsp; have any special characters or space character and&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=266) use a short path like this. All you need to do&nbsp; is just double click windows install.bat file.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=274) It will start the installation automatically for&nbsp; you, it will install everything into a virtual&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=279) environment with using Python 3.10 and it will&nbsp; automatically download the necessary SANA models&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=286) to the accurate folders for you. During the&nbsp; installation, you will also see this error,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=291) it is not important because we are fixing that&nbsp; in the next part. Unfortunately, there is not&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=297) an officially supported Triton for Windows but&nbsp; we are using a pre-compiled wheel. Moreover, you&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=304) will see that my downloader has been optimized for&nbsp; speed, it will use your entire speed, currently,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=311) you see this is downloading with 100 megabytes&nbsp; per second on my Computer even more than that.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=317) However, if you get an error, however, if you&nbsp; get an error during the download for any reason,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=323) we have Windows fix model download.bat file,&nbsp; you can run this afterwards if you get an error&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=330) during this stage. So, the installation has been&nbsp; completed, quickly verify whether there are any&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=336) errors or not. Moreover, you should save the logs&nbsp; if there is an error. How to, you see in the top&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=343) here, right click, export text, save it anywhere&nbsp; and send me installation logs. On Windows 10,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=350) you need to select everything like this, ctrl-C,&nbsp; copy, paste anywhere and send me logs. Then click&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=357) anywhere to close. Now we are ready to start using&nbsp; the SANA model from the NVIDIA. How to start,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=364) you see there is Windows start.bat file,&nbsp; double click it, more info run anyway and&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=369) it is started. Do not run any of the bat files as&nbsp; an administrator unless it is explicitly stated.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=377) All of my scripts runs as normal user. So, this is&nbsp; the interface. How to use this interface, first of&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=383) all, decide which model you are going to use. SANA&nbsp; 2K model is 4 megapixel model and may not work on&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=391) low VRAM GPUs even though I have made an amazing&nbsp; optimization to the pipeline of the SANA model.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=399) With my optimization, I am offloading VAE and the&nbsp; model at the final stage of the image generation,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=406) otherwise it was very slow and it was using a lot&nbsp; of VRAM. So first decide which model you are going&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=411) to use. Let's use the SANA 2K model, 4 megapixel,&nbsp; when you change model, wait until model reloading&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=419) has been completed, you see currently it is&nbsp; reloading the model. Model has been reloaded.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=424) Type your prompt like super fast, amazing car&nbsp; moving on the ice on a sunny day, then here the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=432) resolution. SANA works slightly different than&nbsp; other models, it is based on the aspect ratio,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=439) it is always going to generate same resolution.&nbsp; So, when you change resolution to 1536 to 1536,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=447) it is still going to generate in 2048 to 2048&nbsp; because this is SANA 2K model. Therefore,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=456) I recommend you to set the aspect ratio from this&nbsp; dropdown box that I have added for you, let's try&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=463) 4:3, so you see it is going to automatically&nbsp; set accurate resolution for you like this. Then&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=468) there are sampling steps, I didn't notice much&nbsp; improvement with more steps but you can do any&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=474) number of steps you want. CFG guidance scale is&nbsp; going to impact how much it is going to follow&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=481) your prompt, this is default value. PAG guidance&nbsp; scale is again related to the SANA model itself,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=488) you can try different values and see their impact.&nbsp; You can also use negative prompt if you wish. But&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=495) it is probably not necessary, moreover, we have&nbsp; image styles that you can immediately apply.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=502) And by default, it is going to randomize seed,&nbsp; so with different seed, you are going to get a&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=508) different image every time you generate an image&nbsp; even though the prompt is same. Finally, we are&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=514) supporting only one sampler at the moment. You can&nbsp; also increase batch size, this is going to speed&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=520) up your generation, it is working and you can&nbsp; generate any number of images as you wish. Okay,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=527) let's click run and let's begin generation. You&nbsp; can always follow the status on the CMD window&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=534) which I recommend because always there will be&nbsp; more information on the CMD window. You see my&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=542) extreme optimization is working amazing, otherwise&nbsp; it would be using a lot of VRAM. And even though&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=548) we are generating huge resolution, the speed&nbsp; is great as you are seeing right now. So, it&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=552) is moving models back and forth and the image has&nbsp; been generated. Let's change aspect ratio to 16:9&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=560) and generate. The first generation can be slower&nbsp; than the consequent ones. So, it is 1.38 IT per&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=567) second on RTX 3090 TI right now on the 4 megapixel&nbsp; resolution model. This is a huge resolution. And&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=575) we got the image. So, where are these images&nbsp; are saved, click open outputs folder. It will&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=581) open the folder, they will be saved like this,&nbsp; you see online demo image and there will be the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=588) date of the folder. Let's open one of the images,&nbsp; so you see this is an original native 4 megapixel&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=595) resolution image. I made this application very,&nbsp; very advanced, it supports multi line prompt. So,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=601) I can type here another thing. Let's try car,&nbsp; truck, apple. And let's try 3D model style and&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=609) let's generate. So, it is going to generate each&nbsp; one of the prompts one by one, this also supports&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=615) batch size and number of generations. With this&nbsp; way, you can type your prompts each line and it&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=622) will generate that line with an order. You can&nbsp; follow the status on here. So, you see after the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=628) first image, it says generated one over three&nbsp; images, this is showing everything for you. So,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=634) this is the first image, we just prompt car, this&nbsp; is an extremely simple prompt. You can see example&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=641) prompts at the bottom and try them and understand&nbsp; how they are working. These prompts are from the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=647) official repository of the SANA model from the&nbsp; NVIDIA. And as these prompts are generated,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=654) you will see this interface is getting updated,&nbsp; this is also a very cool feature that I have&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=660) developed. You see like this to like this. Yeah, I&nbsp; cannot say this is a great image but our prompt is&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=665) also very simple, that is why. But we can clearly&nbsp; see that it is following the 3D prompt. You can&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=672) also click this download icon to download it, also&nbsp; click here to see it as a full screen like this.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=678) My application is using the latest version of the&nbsp; Gradio, so it is fully up to date. And the third&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=684) image is arriving. Yes, this is just an apple in&nbsp; 3D. We can also try anime, let's try. By the way,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=692) I am doing 40 steps, this is not mandatory,&nbsp; you can also try 18 steps which is default.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=698) Sometimes it may not display image in here after&nbsp; it has been generated, in that case, go to the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=703) outputs folder and the image will be saved there,&nbsp; so you can see. So, this was the anime car image,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=710) it is looking pretty, pretty good, it is just&nbsp; car prompt with the style of anime. And this&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=717) is native 4 megapixel, I can see the resolution&nbsp; 2,688 to 1,536. And the truck. Yes, the anime&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=728) truck is even better than that as you are seeing&nbsp; right now. If you want to edit these styles, it&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=734) is also possible. Go to the SANA model where you&nbsp; have installed, go to the app folder. And when you&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=740) edit this SECourses app file, you will see these&nbsp; styles. And all images have been generated. So,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=745) this is the anime version of the Apple. It is just&nbsp; looking amazing. This model is an improvement and&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=751) they are publishing new models, so this model is&nbsp; promising, hopefully I will also make tutorials&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=757) for training SANA model. Now I will show you how&nbsp; to use this amazing model on the Massed Compute,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=764) so if you don't have a powerful GPU, you can&nbsp; also use it on the Massed Compute, then RunPod,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=770) then on a free Kaggle account. Unfortunately, on&nbsp; the free Kaggle account, the SANA 2K model is not&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=775) working but SANA 1K model is working perfectly&nbsp; fine. Now I will show you how to use the SANA on&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=781) Massed Compute on a cloud service, if you don't&nbsp; have a powerful GPU, this is the way of using it&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=788) fast or if you want to do more scaling, generating&nbsp; faster, again, cloud is your choice. So, when you&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=795) scroll down, you will see our cloud section and&nbsp; in here, I recommend using Massed Compute, after&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=802) Massed Compute, I will show RunPod and Kaggle as&nbsp; well. If you haven't downloaded the zip file yet,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=808) go to the very bottom and download zip file from&nbsp; the attachments. Then please use this registration&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=814) link if you haven't registered yet to the Massed&nbsp; Compute, I appreciate that. After registering,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=820) go to billing, set up your credits and load&nbsp; some balance then. Go to the deploy and in here,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=826) you will see the available GPUs, so which GPU I&nbsp; recommend. I recommend L40 if it is available,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=834) however, since our coupon is now working on L40,&nbsp; you see it is not available at the moment. So,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=839) I will go with the second best GPU RTX A6000.&nbsp; You don't need multiple GPUs but if you want&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=845) to generate with multiple GPUs, you can also&nbsp; select them. To generate on multiple GPUs,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=849) you need to start multiple instances of the&nbsp; application on each GPU with export Cuda visible&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=855) devices. It is so easy. So, from the category&nbsp; select creator and from image select SECourses.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=862) Then you see the price is 62 cents per hour. Then&nbsp; we are going to apply our coupon SECourses verify.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=869) And now it is 31 cents per hour, deploy. Wait&nbsp; a while, it will move you to the GPU's page,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=875) yes. In here, we need to wait until&nbsp; initialization has been completed, moreover,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=880) if this is your first time using Massed Compute,&nbsp; you should install ThinLinc client. The link of&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=886) ThinLinc client is here. Click here then download&nbsp; according to your platform, it works on Windows,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=892) Mac, Linux, I'm on Windows, so click here. Click&nbsp; the downloaded exe file. Click yes, click next. I&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=900) accept, next, install. So, everything is default,&nbsp; finish. Then on this screen, click options, go to&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=907) the local devices, uncheck all and check drives.&nbsp; We are going to add a synchronization folder,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=912) this is for transferring small files. Like&nbsp; generated images or the downloaded scripts,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=919) so from here, remove everything. And click add,&nbsp; first of all, generate a folder on your disc&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=924) where you want synchronization to be happen. Go&nbsp; to the any disk you want and generate a folder,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=930) then copy it's path like this. You see here, I&nbsp; click here and copy with ctrl-C and paste it here.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=936) You see now it is added. Select the permission&nbsp; as read and write, so it can work both ways,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=942) click okay, click okay. Now our ThinLinc client&nbsp; is ready to connect Massed Compute and use it. All&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=948) we need to do is just wait initialization. Okay,&nbsp; so the Massed Compute has been initialized, you&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=954) see status is running. Now we need to connect it.&nbsp; So, copy this, paste it. Copy this, paste it here&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=961) and make sure that username Ubuntu is also copy&nbsp; pasted here. If you click end existing session,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=968) it is going to close all of the running&nbsp; applications on your Massed Compute on the cloud&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=974) service. Do not use this option unless you needed&nbsp; it, unless you are not able to connect to the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=980) remote machine or the synchronization folder is&nbsp; not working, then click connect. Click continue.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=986) Wait until this screen appears, then click start.&nbsp; And now this is the interface of the cloud Massed&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=993) Compute machine. So, this is running on the cloud,&nbsp; not on my Computer, I can do whatever I want here.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=1000) First of all, we should move the downloaded&nbsp; zip file into our synchronization folder. So,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=1007) the synchronization folder depends on wherever you&nbsp; have made it, it is inside here in my Computer.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=1013) Then click home here at the left top, go to the&nbsp; thindrives here and enter inside the folder. This&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=1021) folder will be synchronized from your Computer,&nbsp; these will not work for big files. Remember,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=1027) for big files, use like Google Drive, OneDrive&nbsp; or Hugging Face, however, for small files, it&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=1032) will work. Do not install anything here. First of&nbsp; all, you should copy the files into the downloads&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=1038) or the other folders, so let's refresh this&nbsp; page to see the zip file. If you don't see it,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=1044) refresh it and here SANA zip file. So, I will&nbsp; drag and drop it into the downloads folder,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=1050) wait until it is copied here. Yes, it's copied&nbsp; already. Right click, extract here. Then enter&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=1057) inside that folder and then open Massed Compute&nbsp; instructions txt file. Copy this installation&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=1065) command with ctrl-C. Go back to the files here,&nbsp; click this three dots icon, open in terminal.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=1071) You see this terminal has been started inside&nbsp; that folder, you need to be inside this folder.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=1078) Then right click and paste. Then hit enter, it&nbsp; will install everything automatically for us on&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=1085) Massed Compute. The Massed Compute installations&nbsp; are extremely fast. The initialization may take&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=1091) a while but after that, once the machine has been&nbsp; initialized, the installations are like 10 times,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=1099) five times faster than RunPod. That is why I&nbsp; recommend the Massed Compute. You will see the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=1104) download speeds are just amazing, installation&nbsp; speeds are just amazing, it will be installed&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=1109) under two minutes at max this model because this&nbsp; is not a very big model. So, after initialized,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=1116) it will be ready in like two minutes to use. So&nbsp; you see it is downloading with 1 GB per second,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=1123) sometimes, sometimes 500 megabytes per second, the&nbsp; average was around 600 megabytes per second. This&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=1131) is the speed of the Massed Compute, there is no&nbsp; such speed anywhere, wow, this was downloaded with&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=1137) 600 megabytes per second. So, the installation&nbsp; has been completed already, you can quickly verify&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=1143) whether there are any errors or not. But it is not&nbsp; mandatory, then return back to the Massed Compute&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=1149) instructions txt file. Copy this part, you see,&nbsp; ctrl-C, return back to the folder where you have&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=1156) extracted and installed. Click this three dots&nbsp; icon, open in terminal, right click and paste,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=1162) then it will start the application with a Gradio&nbsp; live link. You can also use it locally inside&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=1167) ThinLinc client, however, I don't recommend it&nbsp; because it is slower. The Gradio will be faster,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=1173) okay, Gradio started, copy this link. You can&nbsp; access this link from your Computer, from your&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=1180) phone, from tablet, wherever you want, even from&nbsp; your TV, then select the model which you want to&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=1186) generate images. Let's select SANA 2K model, wait&nbsp; for processing to be completed. This will take&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=1193) a while when do you first time load the model.&nbsp; Then we will be able to generate images. Okay,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=1199) so the model has been loaded. Now we are ready&nbsp; to start generating images, it is exactly same&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=1204) as on the Windows tutorial part. Let's generate&nbsp; a car image as an anime, hit run. If you want to&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=1210) see the status of the CMD window, go back to the&nbsp; ThinLinc client and you will see the generation,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=1216) it is pretty, pretty fast. 1.78 IT per second,&nbsp; faster than my RTX 3090 and this is only 31&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=1225) cents per hour on Massed Compute. And the image has been generated. So when we click&nbsp;this here. So you will see the image here. You can&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=1232) click this icon to download it onto your Computer&nbsp; or what you can do, you can go back to TinLinc&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=1239) client, click open outputs folder, inside here,&nbsp; it should open the folder, if it doesn't open the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=1245) folder I will fix this later. Maybe since this is&nbsp; running on. Yes, this is running on Gradio live,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=1250) so it won't open it. So go to the SANA&nbsp; folder, go to the output, online demo images,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=1256) and this is where the generated images&nbsp; are saved. So, you can right-click, copy,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=1262) and go to the home, go to the thindrives, enter&nbsp; inside your synchronization folder, and paste it&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=1268) there. If you have too many images, it may take a&nbsp; while for synchronization, but it should be fast&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=1273) if you don't have many. Then, when I go back to&nbsp; my synchronization folder on my computer, I will&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=1279) see that it will appear here. Yes, you see. When I&nbsp; enter inside the folder, I will see the image. So,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=1285) there is no stop and continue feature on the&nbsp; Massed Compute. If you want to stop using your&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=1292) credits, you have to terminate the instance. But&nbsp; once you terminate the instance, everything will&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=1298) be gone forever. So, if you stop the instance,&nbsp; it will not stop using your credits. You see,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=1304) it is also saying that this does not stop billing.&nbsp; There is no permanent storage on Massed Compute&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=1309) yet. Hopefully, it will arrive soon. So, if you&nbsp; need permanent storage, you need to use RunPod,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=1314) which I am going to show after this part of the&nbsp; tutorial. So, let's terminate this instance,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=1319) then it will not be using our credits anymore.&nbsp; Now, I will show how to use NVIDIA Labs SANA&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=1326) model on RunPod. If you don't have a powerful GPU,&nbsp; or if you want to scale up for any reason, you can&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=1332) use RunPod to generate images. My recommendation&nbsp; is Massed Compute, but if you want RunPod, then&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=1340) here it is. First of all, please register with&nbsp; this link. I appreciate that. Then, let's log in&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=1346) after registration. Then, go to the billing, set&nbsp; up your billing, set some balance, then go to the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=1352) pods. Then, click deploy. Before deploying, make&nbsp; sure that you have downloaded the ZIP file from&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=1359) the attachments and extracted it anywhere. Why?&nbsp; Because you need to read the RunPod instructions&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=1367) TXT file. When you open that file, it will show&nbsp; you which RunPod template to use. So, this is the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=1374) template that we need. This is important. Pick&nbsp; any GPU you want. I am going to use RTX 4090. It&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=1380) is a very fast GPU, and I am going to use secure&nbsp; cloud because I need faster initialization right&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=1386) now. You can pick the server from here. I find&nbsp; that this is working a little bit faster. And&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=1391) then RTX 4090. Then, click change template, type&nbsp; torch, and find the RunPod PyTorch 2.2.0. This is&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=1401) the recommended version right now that you need.&nbsp; Click edit template, set the disk like 50 GB,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=1408) and set override. Then, click deploy on demand.&nbsp; Then, go to my pods. My pods are also here,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=1415) and wait for initialization to be completed. Since&nbsp; this is an official, very lightweight template,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=1422) it will be very, very fast. If it is not very&nbsp; fast, then the pod is likely to be broken. Okay,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=1428) it was really fast. Then, click connect and&nbsp; connect the Jupyter lab. If this is orange or&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=1433) not enabled, refresh the page and try again. If&nbsp; this page doesn't load, refresh and try again,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=1439) and you can also sometimes restart your browser.&nbsp; Then, click this arrow, go to your downloads,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=1444) and upload the downloaded ZIP file like this.&nbsp; Then, right-click and extract archive. Then,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=1451) click this refresh icon. Wait for extraction.&nbsp; Then, double-click, open RunPod instructions.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=1456) The installation command is here. Just&nbsp; copy it with Ctrl+C, open a new terminal,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=1462) and you can do Ctrl+V, or right-click and paste.&nbsp; Both of them are working, and it will install&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=1469) everything automatically for you. Just wait&nbsp; for the installation to be completed. So, the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=1473) installation on RunPod has been completed. Quickly&nbsp; scroll up and see if there are any errors or not.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=1479) The models have been downloaded, everything is&nbsp; ready. Return back to the RunPod instructions&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=1484) TXT file, copy all of these, this is for starting,&nbsp; open a new terminal, then paste it, and hit Enter.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=1492) It is going to start the SANA app on RunPod with&nbsp; a Gradio live share link. You can also use RunPod&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=1500) proxy to connect. However, we didn't add the&nbsp; proxy port during the initialization, therefore&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=1506) we cannot use it right now. And I also recommend&nbsp; using the Gradio live share because it is working&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=1512) way better than the RunPod proxy system itself. So,&nbsp; it is getting started. So, the Gradio live share&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=1518) arrived, click it. This will be running on RunPod,&nbsp; not on your computer, and it will be really,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=1523) really fast. You can also access this from&nbsp; your tablet, from your phone, from your TV,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=1528) wherever you want. Then, use the model that you&nbsp; want exactly same as in the Windows tutorial part.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=1535) Let's generate an image with the 2K model and&nbsp; see the speed. The initial loading of the RunPod&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=1541) will be way slower than the Massed Compute or&nbsp; Windows. RunPod hard drives are usually very slow.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=1548) The download speeds are really good right now&nbsp; because I have optimized these applications for&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=1552) faster downloads. You see, it is using the entire&nbsp; download speed. If I didn't make these changes,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=1559) it would be limited to like 40 MB per second. But&nbsp; now it is even able to get 300 MB per second. So,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=1566) the downloads of the shards have been completed.&nbsp; Now, we need to wait for models to be loaded. This&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=1572) is the slowest part on RunPod usually. You need&nbsp; to wait until this processing is gone. The model&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=1579) has been switched. So, the model has been loaded.&nbsp; Let's type an example prompt like car, and let's&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=1586) generate with anime. As I said, please watch the&nbsp; Windows tutorial part to learn how to use this&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=1591) application. The speed is just mind-blowingly&nbsp; fast. We can see. It is 2.5 IT per second,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=1597) 2.6 IT per second. It will take a few seconds.&nbsp; Yes, the image has been generated. You can click&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=1604) here to download, and it should download, yes. Or,&nbsp; you can go to the SANA folder here, output folder,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=1611) online demo image, and this is where they are&nbsp; saved. Right-click and download as an archive. It&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=1617) will download all of the generated images for you.&nbsp; The usage, the rest is same as on the Windows,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=1623) so watch that part. If you don't want your credits&nbsp; to be spent, you need to stop the pod. However,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=1629) stopping the pod will still not stop using your&nbsp; credits. You need to terminate the pod. Once you&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=1635) terminate the pod, you won't be able to recover&nbsp; any of the files again. You can also start this&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=1641) pod again and start using it immediately again.&nbsp; For reusing it, you just need to run this command&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=1647) as usual. Okay, let's terminate this pod so&nbsp; we won't be spending any money, and it is&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=1652) terminated. Now, I will show how you can use the&nbsp; SANA model on a free Kaggle account. This is the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=1658) least recommended way, but it is free. So, if you&nbsp; don't want to pay any money to any cloud service,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=1665) if you don't have a powerful GPU, you can use&nbsp; Kaggle free GPUs 30 hours every week. Yes,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=1673) every week. So, how to use Kaggle? First of all,&nbsp; download the attached ZIP file. Inside there,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=1679) there will be a Kaggle notebook. Extract it.&nbsp; Go to the kaggle.com, generate your account,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=1684) it is free. After generating your account, make&nbsp; sure that you have verified your phone number from&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=1690) settings, otherwise, it will not work. Then,&nbsp; click create a new notebook. Then, click file&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=1695) and import the notebook, browse files, go to the&nbsp; folder where you have extracted the ZIP file, and&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=1702) you see Kaggle free account notebook version 3.&nbsp; Double-click it and select, then you see selected,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=1708) and click import. Then, wait until you see this,&nbsp; then click okay. Now, what you need to do is,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=1714) first of all, you need to select the session&nbsp; options. You see, accelerator is selected as GPU&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=1721) T4x2. This is important. Then, make sure that the&nbsp; internet is on. If you are not able to select the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=1726) GPU, that means that your account is not phone&nbsp; verified. Once you have both of them selected,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=1733) click the start session, wait until this becomes&nbsp; green. It should be pretty fast. Okay, you see&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=1741) it is becoming green, and when you click here, you&nbsp; should see the GPU and everything. Yes, now we are&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=1746) ready. Then, click this cell. You can either click&nbsp; this play icon here, or if it is not visible,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=1753) you can click the run current cell here. Click&nbsp; it. The first cell is going to install everything&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=1759) automatically for us. Just wait until this&nbsp; cancel run disappears. Once it is disappeared,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=1766) it means that the installation has been completed.&nbsp; You can also follow the what is happening in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=1773) output. You will see the outputs like this.&nbsp; Just wait until cancel run disappears, and the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=1779) cell execution has been completed. So, the Kaggle&nbsp; installation has been completed. We need to get a&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=1786) token from here. Click here, this link, register&nbsp; an account on the Ngrok, it is free. Copy your&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=1792) token, then paste it here, then execute this cell.&nbsp; Then, you will get a link here. Open this link,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=1800) but do not click visit site yet. Then, click&nbsp; this cell, and it will start the application.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=1807) We need to wait until the application is started,&nbsp; then we will click this visit site. So, wait here&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=1815) for the application to start. You will see it&nbsp; is running on local URL. Once you see that, that&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=1821) means the application has been started. Let's just&nbsp; wait a little bit. Yes, now running on local URL,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=1828) that means the application has been started.&nbsp; Click visit site. Now, we will be able to use&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=1833) the SANA model on a free Kaggle account. So, put&nbsp; your prompt, select your aspect ratio exactly as&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=1840) in the Windows tutorial part, then run, and&nbsp; it will start generating images. The same is&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=1845) exactly as on the Windows tutorial part. SANA 2K&nbsp; model is not working on Kaggle yet because of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=1851) GPU limitations. And what if you want to download&nbsp; generated images all at once? There is a cell here&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=1859) to run this cell, you need to cancel run. It will&nbsp; generate images in the Kaggle working directory.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=1864) I will show after the first image has been&nbsp; generated. Moreover, you can also download from&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=1870) the Gradio interface as well. The first generation&nbsp; may be slower because it will download necessary&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=1876) files, load them, but the consequent ones will be&nbsp; faster. So, the image on the Kaggle notebook has&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=1883) been generated. You see, it is here. I can click&nbsp; here to download the image. It is downloaded. Or,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=1889) I can use this mass download. To download it,&nbsp; let's cancel run and click this cell, and it&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=1895) will generate images inside the Kaggle working&nbsp; directory. Let's refresh it. Yes, so you see&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=1901) images.zip file. Click these three dots icon and&nbsp; download, and it will download the images. If you&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=1907) want to restart the application after this, let's&nbsp; right-click and clear output of all cells. Then,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=1914) you need to get a new link from here. So, execute&nbsp; this cell, get a new link, open it, but don't&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=1921) click visit site yet. Start the application, and&nbsp; once we see the local URL, it is same as the first&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=1927) time we will be able to start using it. Moreover,&nbsp; how much time you left will be displayed here.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=1934) You see, currently, I have 30 hours this week to&nbsp; use. I can generate images 30 hours on the Kaggle&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=1942) for free, and it is ready now, and visit site.&nbsp; Kaggle is extremely picky, so if you generate&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW-MHmoNcqo&t=1949) anything not safe for work, they will block&nbsp; your account. So, use the Kaggle with respect&nbsp;&nbsp;
