### Video Transcription


- [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNR2HZRw74E&t=0) NVIDIA claims that the newest driver brings huge&nbsp; speed improvements when you are using the AI.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNR2HZRw74E&t=6) It is claimed that the newest driver brings huge&nbsp; performance with ONNX runtime. Automatic1111 Web&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNR2HZRw74E&t=13) UI supports ONNX models with TensorRT. So today I&nbsp; am going to compare this newest driver with basic&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNR2HZRw74E&t=21) installation and also TensorRT ONNX models. I am&nbsp; going to do testing on the RTX 3090 TI on Windows&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNR2HZRw74E&t=30) 10. I am going to compare NVIDIA drivers 552 vs&nbsp; 555, which is the latest driver. All tests are&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNR2HZRw74E&t=38) compared on both drivers. I am going to do testing&nbsp; on fresh Automatic1111 Web UI installation. I&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNR2HZRw74E&t=45) am going to test the speed with the latest torch&nbsp; version and the xFormers version. Moreover, I will&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNR2HZRw74E&t=52) install TensorRT and test and repeat the testing&nbsp; on TensorRT generated model, and we will see the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNR2HZRw74E&t=60) speed differences between older driver, newer&nbsp; driver, between default and TensorRT model.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNR2HZRw74E&t=67) Make sure to watch the entire tutorial because&nbsp; it is super important. For fresh installation,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNR2HZRw74E&t=72) I will use my installer script. So let's use this&nbsp; folder. Extract here. Just let's install. This&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNR2HZRw74E&t=79) installer will install everything automatically&nbsp; for us, including downloading the VAE fixed SDXL&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNR2HZRw74E&t=86) base model and the very best styles. So the&nbsp; installation has been completed and the Web&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNR2HZRw74E&t=92) UI started. Let's see the default downloaded&nbsp; models. Let's try the default speed. Okay,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNR2HZRw74E&t=98) photo of an amazing sports car. The very best&nbsp; sampler that I am finding is UniPC. Let's make it&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNR2HZRw74E&t=104) 40 steps. Change the resolution to the default&nbsp; resolution. So initially I will do a warm-up&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNR2HZRw74E&t=111) generation. Then I will generate four images to&nbsp; see the speed. This is the default installation.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNR2HZRw74E&t=117) You see version 1.9.3, Python 3.10.11,&nbsp; Torch version is 2.1.2, xFormers is 0.0.23&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNR2HZRw74E&t=126) and the image is generated. To see the speed, I&nbsp; will pause the video and generate images. Okay,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNR2HZRw74E&t=132) four images are generated. The IT per second is&nbsp; 3.42. So what is my GPU and my driver right now?&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNR2HZRw74E&t=141) To show you that, I will use nvitop. You can use&nbsp; this with pip install nvitop. My driver version is&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNR2HZRw74E&t=150) 551.23, CUDA version is 12.4. The GPU model&nbsp; is not shown in the nvitop. So this is the GPU&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNR2HZRw74E&t=158) versions that I have. NVIDIA SMI command. 3090 TI.&nbsp; So with default fresh installation, the speed is&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNR2HZRw74E&t=164) 3.42 for this driver. Now I am going to update&nbsp; my installation to the latest Torch version and&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNR2HZRw74E&t=172) xFormers. To do that, I will use this .bat file.&nbsp; It will update my installation to the latest.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNR2HZRw74E&t=180) For the speed comparison, the CPU also matters.&nbsp; This is my CPU 13900-K. This is the frequency it is&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNR2HZRw74E&t=187) working right now. Also, my memory is 64 gigabytes&nbsp; and 2500 megahertz DDR4. The version updater will&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNR2HZRw74E&t=197) show you this error, but it is not important&nbsp; because it will automatically fixed Yes, fixed&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNR2HZRw74E&t=202) and the installation completed. So let's start&nbsp; again our web UI with this .bat file. You can also&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNR2HZRw74E&t=210) start it from the web UI user .bat file here.&nbsp; Okay, the latest version started. You will also&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNR2HZRw74E&t=215) notice that this updater installed the one of the&nbsp; very best extension after detailer (ADetailer) latest version.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNR2HZRw74E&t=222) So now the Torch version is 2.3.0 and xFormers&nbsp; is 0.0.26. So let's generate the warmup image&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNR2HZRw74E&t=230) with the same settings. Let's set them up and&nbsp; let's generate. Let's see the nvitop status while&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNR2HZRw74E&t=236) generating. You see this is the nivtop displayed&nbsp; parameters: the watt usage, the GPU utilization,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNR2HZRw74E&t=242) the memory utilization and the warmup image is&nbsp; generated. Now let's try the actual speed. The&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNR2HZRw74E&t=249) generation speed looks like not changed. You see&nbsp; the same speed. Probably for this NVIDIA driver&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNR2HZRw74E&t=256) to be effective, we need TensorRT. So now I&nbsp; am going to install TensorRT extension and&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNR2HZRw74E&t=262) generate TensorRT model to calculate its speed.&nbsp; And after this, I will update my NVIDIA driver&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNR2HZRw74E&t=270) to the latest version, and I will repeat the&nbsp; test. So we will see the speed difference. Okay,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNR2HZRw74E&t=276) the TensorRT installed. Then let's restart the web&nbsp; UI. In the initial run of TensorRT installation,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNR2HZRw74E&t=284) it may take a while. Just patiently wait.&nbsp; Okay, during the initial installation,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNR2HZRw74E&t=288) you will also get this error. Unfortunately,&nbsp; TensorRT developers still didn't fix this error,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNR2HZRw74E&t=294) but we will fix it. So just click OK to&nbsp; these errors. Okay, okay, okay, okay.

- [00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNR2HZRw74E&t=300) Then it will start and the web UI started with&nbsp; TensorRT. Now I will show you how to fix those&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNR2HZRw74E&t=305) annoying pop-ups. So close the web UI, then run&nbsp; the TensorRT installer one more time like this.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNR2HZRw74E&t=313) And it is done. Then start the web UI again. So&nbsp; after doing that, you will not see that error&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNR2HZRw74E&t=319) anymore while starting your web UI. You see it&nbsp; is getting started. No errors and started. For&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNR2HZRw74E&t=326) TensorRT to work, we need to generate TensorRT.&nbsp; Make sure that you have selected your model,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNR2HZRw74E&t=330) which one you want to generate TensorRT. And I&nbsp; will use this batch size one static. Actually,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNR2HZRw74E&t=337) I am going to change this. So the min batch&nbsp; size one, optimal batch size one, let's say&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNR2HZRw74E&t=342) maximum batch size four. It depends on you. You&nbsp; can set the minimum height, whichever you want&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNR2HZRw74E&t=347) like this. Okay, let's also set this like this and&nbsp; prompt. This is important. Let's make the optimal&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNR2HZRw74E&t=354) prompt like 150 and let's make the maximum 225.&nbsp; Okay, so then export engine. To see the status,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNR2HZRw74E&t=363) you should check out the CMD window. It may take&nbsp; a while depending on your GPU model. In the CMD&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNR2HZRw74E&t=370) window, it doesn't show anything. However, in&nbsp; the nvitop, I can see that it is using GPU.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNR2HZRw74E&t=376) GPU utilization increases or decreases. So it is&nbsp; working. You can also see the memory usage of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNR2HZRw74E&t=381) GPU. After a while, you will start seeing messages&nbsp; like this. It is working and progressing. Okay,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNR2HZRw74E&t=387) the model generation has been completed. You can&nbsp; see that TensorRT engines have been saved to the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNR2HZRw74E&t=393) disk. It took around six minutes, a little&nbsp; bit longer perhaps. And we can see exported&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNR2HZRw74E&t=399) successfully. To be able to use it, we need to&nbsp; go to the settings. And in here search for quick,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNR2HZRw74E&t=405) you will see this part and type here Unet.&nbsp; And you will see SD Unet apply settings.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNR2HZRw74E&t=413) Don't worry, you will also get this message&nbsp; and reload UI. Now we have SD Unet and in here&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNR2HZRw74E&t=419) we can select none, which will use the default&nbsp; Unet of the model or we can use the Unet of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNR2HZRw74E&t=426) Realistic Vision which we are going to use.&nbsp; This is the TensorRT model. And let's use&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNR2HZRw74E&t=431) the same prompt. This doesn't change quality, but&nbsp; this increases the speed significantly. However,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNR2HZRw74E&t=438) this takes time to compile, but compiling is only&nbsp; one time and it is ready. And let's generate the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNR2HZRw74E&t=444) initial warm-up. We can see that it is loading the&nbsp; TensorRT Unet and the generation started. So this&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNR2HZRw74E&t=450) is the initial warm-up generation while recording&nbsp; video. Okay, now it is time to test. So I'm going&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNR2HZRw74E&t=456) to make batch count four. So the test has been&nbsp; completed. We can see that now we are getting&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNR2HZRw74E&t=461) 5.51 it per second. This is almost the speed of&nbsp; 4090. So the speed increases like this minus 3.41&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNR2HZRw74E&t=473) over 3.41. We got 61.5% speed increase without any&nbsp; quality change, quality loss, quality difference.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNR2HZRw74E&t=484) Now I am going to install the NVIDIA driver to see&nbsp; the difference. I am going to install the latest&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNR2HZRw74E&t=490) version of NVIDIA driver. So how are we going to&nbsp; download it? Download NVIDIA drivers, because I&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNR2HZRw74E&t=496) see that some people are having issues. So go to&nbsp; here, select your GPU model. It is this one. And&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNR2HZRw74E&t=503) yes, I am using Game Ready Driver. Lets search.&nbsp; It is working better I think. Download and&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNR2HZRw74E&t=508) download should start. If it doesn't start.&nbsp; Yeah, we need to click here. Download and&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNR2HZRw74E&t=513) the download started. So from driver version 551, I&nbsp; am going to 555. Okay, it is downloaded. So all we&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNR2HZRw74E&t=520) need to do is run as administrator. Click Yes,&nbsp; when it is asking and click OK. I am going to&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNR2HZRw74E&t=526) show you the selection that I am making NVIDIA&nbsp; Graphics Driver, agree and continue. Custom, advanced&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNR2HZRw74E&t=533) and I am going to perform a clean installation.&nbsp; Now I will just do next. But before doing that,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNR2HZRw74E&t=538) I am going to turn off the video recording and I&nbsp; will restart the computer and we will return back.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNR2HZRw74E&t=543) Okay, so I have installed the latest driver and&nbsp; restarted the system. You can see the newest CUDA&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNR2HZRw74E&t=549) driver version (555.85) and driver version here. And let's&nbsp; make a warm-up test. And let's see the results. So&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNR2HZRw74E&t=556) after the warm-up, I have generated four images&nbsp; and we can see that we have a significant speed&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNR2HZRw74E&t=562) drop from 3.41 it per second to 3.27 it per&nbsp; second. Let's see the TensorRT speed because&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNR2HZRw74E&t=571) this is what I wonder. So let's just change the&nbsp; batch size to one and do the initial warm-up.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNR2HZRw74E&t=577) You should watch the messages here. When doing&nbsp; the TensorRT optimization, the xFormers gets&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNR2HZRw74E&t=583) disabled. So the TensorRT works. And yes, we can&nbsp; see the speed right now. So here are the speeds&nbsp;

- [00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNR2HZRw74E&t=590) after generating four images. We got a speed&nbsp; drop after the newest drivers. NVIDIA is&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNR2HZRw74E&t=596) disappointing us. I don't know why. Before ending&nbsp; this video, I will also test the optimization of&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNR2HZRw74E&t=604) the PyTorch itself. So you see there are different&nbsp; optimizations here. Let's try the SDP. This is&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNR2HZRw74E&t=612) the optimization of the PyTorch as far as I&nbsp; know. Let's see the speed of generation. OK,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNR2HZRw74E&t=618) this one is even slower than the xFormers. I'm&nbsp; going to test these other ones as well. Let's&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNR2HZRw74E&t=624) see which one will perform best. This other one&nbsp; was even slower. Let's see the Doggettx. This is&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNR2HZRw74E&t=631) the latest one. So this is it. It is not always&nbsp; best to upgrade NVIDIA drivers. Unfortunately,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNR2HZRw74E&t=638) currently, this new driver didn't bring me any&nbsp; speed increase for some reason. If we get a speed&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNR2HZRw74E&t=644) increase, let me know. But the TensorRT is working&nbsp; amazingly. So you should use it if you are going&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNR2HZRw74E&t=651) to generate a lot of images on the same model.&nbsp; Hopefully, see you in another amazing tutorial.
