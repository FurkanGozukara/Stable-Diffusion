### Video Transcription


- [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8oeCFyM5gA&t=0) In this video, I'm going to show you how to use&nbsp; automatic installer for ReRender A Video. If you&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8oeCFyM5gA&t=7) don't know what is ReRender A Video, it allows you&nbsp; to turn video into animation or anything that you&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8oeCFyM5gA&t=14) wish like this you are seeing right now. I have&nbsp; turned the Larry Wheels clip into this anime&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8oeCFyM5gA&t=19) version. It is very, very coherent and amazing.&nbsp; So let's download all_files.zip file. Let's cut&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8oeCFyM5gA&t=28) it and go to our drive, make a new folder, make&nbsp; its name. Do not have any spaces, do not have any&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8oeCFyM5gA&t=36) space character or special character. So let's&nbsp; say rerender_test, something like this. You see,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8oeCFyM5gA&t=44) I don't have any special character or I don't&nbsp; have any space character. Right click extract.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8oeCFyM5gA&t=50) I am using Winrar, but you can use anything&nbsp; else. So it has all the files. You just&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8oeCFyM5gA&t=55) need to install with large VRAM or low VRAM.&nbsp; Large VRAM will install latest Torch version,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8oeCFyM5gA&t=64) therefore it will be faster, but it will use more&nbsp; VRAM. OK, you just need to just wait right now.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8oeCFyM5gA&t=72) Nothing else. It will do everything for you. So&nbsp; the installation has been completed as you are&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8oeCFyM5gA&t=77) seeing right now. Let's hit something and close&nbsp; it. Then what we need to do is we will just run&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8oeCFyM5gA&t=84) run.bat file. Just wait and it has started. Let's&nbsp; open the URL. This is the URL. And let's select a&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8oeCFyM5gA&t=95) video for testing. OK, here, let's see. I have&nbsp; Larry Wheel testing here. OK. Posing. Yeah,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8oeCFyM5gA&t=109) this will be this will be input video. So you&nbsp; need to define your prompt. And one of the most&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8oeCFyM5gA&t=116) crucial thing is you need to describe that clip.&nbsp; So if you have very different clips, then you need&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8oeCFyM5gA&t=123) to split your clips and generate each one of&nbsp; them separately. A muscular man is posing in&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8oeCFyM5gA&t=131) a gym. This is defining this clip. Let me show&nbsp; you. You see he is posing here. Not much else as&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8oeCFyM5gA&t=140) you are seeing right now. OK. So before running&nbsp; all frames, make sure that you have first output&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8oeCFyM5gA&t=150) frame. So there are a lot of settings. I am still&nbsp; experimenting, but default settings are really,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8oeCFyM5gA&t=155) really good. You can improve frame resolution up&nbsp; to 704 because it's a HD video, not full HD. So I&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8oeCFyM5gA&t=166) will make this 704 this will have dramatic effect&nbsp; on your output. And other than that, I use Canny,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8oeCFyM5gA&t=174) Canny low threshold 25 Canny high threshold 50&nbsp; and the base model that you select, this will&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8oeCFyM5gA&t=181) have huge effect on you. So let's make this a 2D&nbsp; anime merge. These are automatically downloaded.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8oeCFyM5gA&t=189) And one more thing, extremely important number of&nbsp; parallel processes. If you don't have 24 gigabyte,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8oeCFyM5gA&t=196) make this one. If you have 24 gigabyte VRAM, make&nbsp; this 2. Don't make this 3. It will use shared&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8oeCFyM5gA&t=204) VRAM. You will have a lot of issues. So make this&nbsp; one. This is super important. And other than that,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8oeCFyM5gA&t=211) you don't need to actually make too much changes.&nbsp; Just change your prompt and seed until you get&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8oeCFyM5gA&t=218) your desired output. So it is going to load&nbsp; everything and it will process first frame for&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8oeCFyM5gA&t=226) us. Let's just wait. So it is loading all of the&nbsp; files. You see with one click it is all installed.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8oeCFyM5gA&t=234) The models are downloaded and everything is&nbsp; set. But if you want to have more models,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8oeCFyM5gA&t=240) you need to download them into models folder here.&nbsp; Then you need to edit configuration py file and&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8oeCFyM5gA&t=247) restart the app. The configuration py file is&nbsp; here. Let's open it. So you need to add them&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8oeCFyM5gA&t=253) here. So they will be in the drop down menu. This&nbsp; is how you add more models. Okay, it is almost&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8oeCFyM5gA&t=261) done. Let's see the output. So this is the output.&nbsp; This is not the best. So I will change the seed.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8oeCFyM5gA&t=268) You can also add some more prompts such as anime&nbsp; hero. Okay, let's try one more time. This time&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8oeCFyM5gA&t=276) it should be faster because it has cached some of&nbsp; the other things. Okay, yes, it is being faster.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8oeCFyM5gA&t=284) I hope they improve the speed because the speed&nbsp; is not very good. The speed can be faster. So it&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8oeCFyM5gA&t=292) is using about like 9 gigabytes VRAM probably GPU&nbsp; utilization is like this as you are seeing right&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8oeCFyM5gA&t=299) now. I am also recording a video therefore it is&nbsp; also doing video encode. Okay, another one. So you&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8oeCFyM5gA&t=308) can play with different seeding and you can play&nbsp; with ControlNet strength, denoising strength and&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8oeCFyM5gA&t=316) other things and always get your first frame after&nbsp; that hit run all and then you need to patiently&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8oeCFyM5gA&t=324) wait but there is one more thing. I suggest you&nbsp; to edit video blend.py file and make this True.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8oeCFyM5gA&t=332) So you will have much better output results,&nbsp; printed messages in this screen it will make&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8oeCFyM5gA&t=339) your life easier believe me so make this True.&nbsp; OPEN_EBSYNTH_LOG True. So once everything has&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8oeCFyM5gA&t=347) been completed you will get an output video here&nbsp; I didn't wait it I just cancelled it and the video&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8oeCFyM5gA&t=353) will be also saved inside result folder, inside&nbsp; with the video name you had used you see posing&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8oeCFyM5gA&t=361) we had used it and in here you will have blend.mp4&nbsp; file. You see currently it was extracting keys.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8oeCFyM5gA&t=370) But I cancelled it so you will have blend.mp4&nbsp; file here it will be the final output result.
