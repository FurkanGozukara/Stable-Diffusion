MultiTalk is greatly upgraded. After doing more than 1 day more research with MultiTalk by using 8x A6000 48 GB GPUs, I have significantly improved the MultiTalk workflows and now I am sharing 4 different category workflows with you. VRAM usages and  speeds are same but just better quality and animation. Moreover I am introducing a new app which is image and video comparison sliders. Ultra fast and lightweight. Runs as a html app and no GPU is required.

MultiTalk: Bringing Avatars to Life with Lip-Sync

Complementing WAN 2.1 is MultiTalk, a specialized model for generating talking avatars from images and text or audio inputs. Available on platforms like fal.ai, it offers variants such as single-text for solo avatars, multi-text for conversations, and audio-based syncing. By converting text to speech and ensuring natural lip movements, MultiTalk addresses a key challenge in AI video: realistic dialogue delivery.

When paired with WAN 2.1 in ComfyUI workflows, MultiTalk achieves Veo 3-level lip-sync, enabling local AI video projects with enhanced expressiveness. This integration has been hailed for solving lip-sync issues that plagued earlier models, allowing creators to produce dynamic talking-head videos from static portraits. For instance, workflows turn three images into videos in minutes, ideal for animations or virtual influencers.

Veo 3: Google's Leap in Photo-to-Video with Audio

Google's Veo 3, integrated into the Gemini app, marks a milestone in I2V by generating eight-second clips with sound from uploaded photos. Launched in May 2025 and expanded to over 150 countries, it allows users to describe scenes, animate objects, or add audio effects, transforming stills into immersive videos.

Key features include groundbreaking audio generation with perfect lip-sync, improved motion controls, physics simulation, and style precision. Available to Google AI Pro subscribers, it has generated over 40 million videos, from fairy tale reimaginings to ASMR experiments. Safety measures like SynthID watermarks and red teaming ensure responsible use.

Comparative Insights and Future Impact

While WAN 2.1 offers open-source flexibility and multi-task efficiency, MultiTalk adds specialized avatar animation, and Veo 3 excels in seamless audio integration and user-friendliness. Together, they democratize video creation, rivaling professional tools. WAN 2.1's local runnability contrasts Veo 3's cloud-based approach, but both achieve high fidelity.

As AI evolves, these models hint at a future where anyone can create cinematic content from a single image, blending creativity with technology. With ongoing updates, expect even longer videos and better realism ahead.

### Video Transcription


- [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgCtUeog41g&t=0) Greetings everyone. Welcome to the Wan 2.1&nbsp; based MultiTalk tutorial. In this tutorial,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgCtUeog41g&t=6) I will show you how to literally one-click to&nbsp; install ComfyUI and MultiTalk and right away&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgCtUeog41g&t=12) start generating amazing animations from static&nbsp; images. MultiTalk generates not only speaking&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgCtUeog41g&t=19) videos but also impressive singing performances.&nbsp; Moreover, MultiTalk can even generate 30-second&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgCtUeog41g&t=26) videos like this upcoming one. [Music/Singing]&nbsp;

- [00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgCtUeog41g&t=29) SECourses shows the way, generating,&nbsp; composing, and play. Images and&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgCtUeog41g&t=44) videos flow, animation 3D glow. Learning&nbsp; AI every day, SECourses shows the way.&nbsp;

- [00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgCtUeog41g&t=58) With our optimizations, one-click&nbsp; installers and modified workflows,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgCtUeog41g&t=62) generating 480p videos requires only 8 gigabytes&nbsp; of VRAM, making it possible to generate amazing&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgCtUeog41g&t=69) videos even on weaker GPUs. To prepare this&nbsp; tutorial, I have literally tested different&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgCtUeog41g&t=76) parameters more than one day and found the very&nbsp; best workflow for you. In this tutorial, I will&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgCtUeog41g&t=82) show local Windows, cloud Massed Compute, and&nbsp; RunPod. Moreover, the tutorial will have manually&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgCtUeog41g&t=89) written subtitles and also video chapters. So as you have seen, we have significantly&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgCtUeog41g&t=95) improved our workflows. We made it possible for&nbsp; maximum resemblance or maximum animation. If you&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgCtUeog41g&t=102) haven't watched the main tutorial, please watch&nbsp; it because after watching this tutorial, you will&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgCtUeog41g&t=108) understand how to use this. All you need to do is&nbsp; just get the latest SwarmUI model downloader, start&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgCtUeog41g&t=115) it as usual, and you will notice something. We&nbsp; have updated our ComfyUI MultiTalk bundle. It&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgCtUeog41g&t=121) now includes the FusionX GGUF Q8. Moreover, in the&nbsp; video generation models, we did split the Wan 2.1&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgCtUeog41g&t=130) models, official models, FusionX models like this,&nbsp; and LORAs. So it will just download the new model.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgCtUeog41g&t=137) After that, download the latest ComfyUI version&nbsp; 38 zip file. It can be a bigger version too.&nbsp;

- [00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgCtUeog41g&t=144) So what is different with this new zip file?&nbsp; When you enter inside the workflows, inside&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgCtUeog41g&t=149) Kijai MultiTalk, now you will see four presets,&nbsp; which are Super Loyal Official, which was in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgCtUeog41g&t=156) initial tutorial, then Loyal Medium Animated, as&nbsp; I have shown you the difference, or Lesser Loyal&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgCtUeog41g&t=164) Super Animated, or Less Loyal More Animated.&nbsp; So depending on your case, you can choose&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgCtUeog41g&t=169) the different workflows and generate videos.&nbsp; The examples I have shown you were all first&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgCtUeog41g&t=176) generations. None of them were cherry-picked. So&nbsp; therefore, as you generate with different prompts,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgCtUeog41g&t=181) different seeds, you may get much better results. Moreover, I have shared a link in this TXT file&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgCtUeog41g&t=188) where you will be able to download the demo&nbsp; videos. Once you download the demo videos and&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgCtUeog41g&t=192) extract the zip file, you will get all these demo&nbsp; videos. These videos containing the workflows,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgCtUeog41g&t=199) so you can drag and drop these into your ComfyUI&nbsp; and it will show you the workflow. For example,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgCtUeog41g&t=204) let me demonstrate you. Let's just&nbsp; drag and drop this into our ComfyUI&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgCtUeog41g&t=209) and it will load the workflow as you are seeing. Moreover, I have shared a new amazing application.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgCtUeog41g&t=216) You see the link is here. Go to there. This is&nbsp; for comparing videos and images. Just download&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgCtUeog41g&t=222) it. This is super lightweight. Extract it into&nbsp; any folder, any drive where you want. Then install&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgCtUeog41g&t=228) update bat file. More info, run anyway. It will&nbsp; install it almost instantly. Then you can start&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgCtUeog41g&t=235) image comparison or video comparison. Let me&nbsp; show you image comparison first. More info,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgCtUeog41g&t=240) run anyway. So this is the image comparison&nbsp; slider. This is so easy to use. Just select all&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgCtUeog41g&t=246) your images and then click full screen and you&nbsp; will be able to compare images. You can switch&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgCtUeog41g&t=253) them from here directly. You see, 512 resolution&nbsp; versus 2048 pixel resolution. It also has zoom&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgCtUeog41g&t=261) feature, so you can zoom the part that you want&nbsp; to see like this. Then you can just change the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgCtUeog41g&t=268) slider like this and make a great comparison.&nbsp; So this is an amazing tool to compare images.&nbsp;

- [00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgCtUeog41g&t=273) Let me show you also video comparison. More&nbsp; info, run anyway. So this is the same logic.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgCtUeog41g&t=279) Let's upload some of the videos. For&nbsp; example, let's compare these ones.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgCtUeog41g&t=283) So drag and drop them into here or you can click&nbsp; here and choose from folder, either way works. It&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgCtUeog41g&t=290) also shows previews. Then click full screen&nbsp; and here the video. So let's, for example,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgCtUeog41g&t=295) select the base at the left and select the&nbsp; most animated at the right. Then click play.&nbsp;

- [00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgCtUeog41g&t=302) With our optimizations, one-click&nbsp; installers and modified workflows,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgCtUeog41g&t=306) generating 480p videos requires only 8&nbsp; gigabytes of VRAM, making it possible&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgCtUeog41g&t=312) to generate amazing videos even on weaker GPUs. So as you are seeing, it is working amazing. You&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgCtUeog41g&t=318) can also zoom this comparison slider as well.&nbsp; So this is working that way. This is extremely&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgCtUeog41g&t=324) useful when you upscale or change minimal things.&nbsp; Let me demonstrate. So let's go back to our test.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgCtUeog41g&t=330) I am doing a lot of upscale testing as well. So&nbsp; let's select two of the videos that I want to&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgCtUeog41g&t=336) show you. Then I will select them from here like&nbsp; this and here, then full screen. Okay. So you see,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgCtUeog41g&t=344) this is upscaled with the upcoming star model.&nbsp; It is really, really good, but it is professional&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgCtUeog41g&t=351) level. Why? Because it is requiring a lot of&nbsp; VRAM, unfortunately. However, don't worry,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgCtUeog41g&t=355) I will also add low VRAM alternatives as well to&nbsp; the application. So let's also play this and see.&nbsp;

- [00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgCtUeog41g&t=361) Greetings everyone. Welcome to the&nbsp; Wan 2.1 based MultiTalk tutorial.&nbsp;

- [00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgCtUeog41g&t=366) Greetings everyone. Welcome to the&nbsp; Wan 2.1 based MultiTalk tutorial.&nbsp;

- [00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgCtUeog41g&t=371) So as you are seeing, we needed this&nbsp; video comparison application as well&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgCtUeog41g&t=376) and it is just working perfect as you are&nbsp; seeing right now. That's all. As I said,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgCtUeog41g&t=381) please watch this main tutorial. Everything has&nbsp; been explained in this one. I'm not going to&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgCtUeog41g&t=386) repeat that. In this tutorial, I have shown how&nbsp; to install ComfyUI and the workflow on Windows,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgCtUeog41g&t=391) then on Massed Compute, and then&nbsp; on RunPod. All three of them are&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgCtUeog41g&t=395) shown. All of them are up to date.&nbsp; Moreover, in the ComfyUI installation,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgCtUeog41g&t=399) I have updated the Windows update file to be&nbsp; more robust. Also on RunPod and Massed Compute,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgCtUeog41g&t=406) just follow the instructions and run the&nbsp; installer again when you want to update and it&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgCtUeog41g&t=411) will update the installation fully. So that's it.&nbsp; Hopefully see you in the future amazing tutorials.
