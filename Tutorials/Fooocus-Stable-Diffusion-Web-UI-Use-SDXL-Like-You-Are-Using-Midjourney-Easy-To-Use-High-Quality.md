### Video Transcription


- [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHTkVm2mcfs&t=0) Greetings everyone. In this tutorial video, I am&nbsp; going to show you how to install and use Fooocus,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHTkVm2mcfs&t=5) one of the very best Web UI for Stable Diffusion&nbsp; based models. You see it has over 14K stars. What&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHTkVm2mcfs&t=13) is the advantage of this Web UI? It is literally&nbsp; one click. It is automatically downloading models&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHTkVm2mcfs&t=21) for you. It has over 200 embedded styles&nbsp; that you can pick and it is automatically&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHTkVm2mcfs&t=30) expanding your prompt so that you don't need to&nbsp; do prompt engineering. You see in these examples,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHTkVm2mcfs&t=36) I just type it a cat, nothing else. Selected&nbsp; the style that I want from here and just hit&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHTkVm2mcfs&t=44) generate and it has generated me amazing quality&nbsp; images with the models that it has automatically&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHTkVm2mcfs&t=51) downloaded. Believe me, you will like this Web&nbsp; UI, so let's delve into it. So the installation&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHTkVm2mcfs&t=58) of Fooocus is so straightforward and easy. You&nbsp; don't even need to have Python installed. I will&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHTkVm2mcfs&t=66) show you how to install and also upgrade it to&nbsp; the latest version. For upgrade, you need Git&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHTkVm2mcfs&t=73) to be installed. When you type Git, you will see&nbsp; Git from here. Just download and install it. So&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHTkVm2mcfs&t=79) for installing Fooocus, we are going to use this&nbsp; release. Click here to download the release. It&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHTkVm2mcfs&t=85) will get downloaded like this. You see it is a&nbsp; 1.8 gigabyte 7z file. It has been completed. So&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHTkVm2mcfs&t=92) let's cut it and move it into the folder where&nbsp; you want to install. So I will make a new folder&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHTkVm2mcfs&t=98) here. Fooocus video. Okay. You can give any name.&nbsp; Let's paste it here. I will use Winrar to extract,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHTkVm2mcfs&t=106) but on Windows you can already extract 7&nbsp; zip files. If you can't just download and&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHTkVm2mcfs&t=112) install Winrar. So I right-click it and clicked&nbsp; extract. This is all I need to do. After that,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHTkVm2mcfs&t=119) I will be able to start using it immediately. Just&nbsp; wait the extraction to be completed. So it comes&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHTkVm2mcfs&t=125) with pre-prepared Python environment for you. So&nbsp; you don't even need to install Python itself. And&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHTkVm2mcfs&t=133) it will come with these three .bat files, which&nbsp; will start the Fooocus. Let's say you want to use&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHTkVm2mcfs&t=140) the latest version of Fooocus because it is under&nbsp; current development as you are seeing right now,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHTkVm2mcfs&t=146) the last commit was 51 minutes ago. So&nbsp; to use it, enter inside Fooocus folder,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHTkVm2mcfs&t=151) open a new CMD like this, and just type git pull.&nbsp; For this command to work, you need to have Git&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHTkVm2mcfs&t=158) installed as I said. After that, you can start&nbsp; three options. So you may be wondering, what are&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHTkVm2mcfs&t=165) these? The Fooocus has a very well written readme&nbsp; file. I suggest you to read this readme file very&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHTkVm2mcfs&t=172) thoroughly. You will find so much information&nbsp; here. It is working even on very low VRAM having&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHTkVm2mcfs&t=180) computers. It also supports Linux with Anaconda&nbsp; or with Python virtual environment. Moreover,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHTkVm2mcfs&t=186) it supports AMD GPUs as well as you are seeing&nbsp; right now. It even supports Mac. So read all of&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHTkVm2mcfs&t=194) the description here. So let's begin with run.bat&nbsp; file, which is the default. It will also download&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHTkVm2mcfs&t=201) the models automatically for us. You see it&nbsp; started downloading Juggernaut XL version 6, and&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHTkVm2mcfs&t=208) the default Python version of Fooocus is Python&nbsp; 3.10.9. So the Fooocus has a lot of advantages. If&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHTkVm2mcfs&t=216) you are moving from Midjourney read this section,&nbsp; you will find how it is easy to use. It is totally&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHTkVm2mcfs&t=223) free. It is open source. So I suggest you to also&nbsp; read this section as well. The download is almost&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHTkVm2mcfs&t=230) completed. Okay, download completed and the model&nbsp; started, you will get this screen. You don't need&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHTkVm2mcfs&t=236) to do anything. You can just type amazing car&nbsp; and nothing else and hit generate. It will start&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHTkVm2mcfs&t=243) generating automatically for you as you are&nbsp; seeing right now. So this is the speed. This&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHTkVm2mcfs&t=248) is the screen where we will see the process. You&nbsp; see it has added a lot of prompts to my prompt.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHTkVm2mcfs&t=256) Everything is automatically done by Fooocus for&nbsp; me. The interface is very nicely designed. It is&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHTkVm2mcfs&t=263) easy to understand and use. Okay, it generated 2&nbsp; images by default, not 4. And you see these are&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHTkVm2mcfs&t=269) the images we got and they are looking amazing,&nbsp; really amazing. Let's open it in here. It is&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHTkVm2mcfs&t=275) really, really good one. And we just typed amazing&nbsp; car, nothing else. So where are these images are&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHTkVm2mcfs&t=281) saved, they are saved inside outputs folder. You&nbsp; will find your saved images here, Fooocus, outputs&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHTkVm2mcfs&t=288) and the image generated day. So what are the other&nbsp; options we have when you click this advanced tab&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHTkVm2mcfs&t=294) here, it will open these advanced settings.&nbsp; So here we can select other aspect ratios,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHTkVm2mcfs&t=302) select number of images and select negative prompt&nbsp; if we want. There is also random here. This is for&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHTkVm2mcfs&t=309) determining the seed. So let's keep it random.&nbsp; And let's try another resolution. For example,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHTkVm2mcfs&t=315) let's try this resolution. Okay, there is also&nbsp; speed and quality. When you click quality, it will&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHTkVm2mcfs&t=321) do more inference steps. Let's see it. So you see&nbsp; it is doing this time 60 inference steps instead&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHTkVm2mcfs&t=330) of 30. The speed is let's see the speed. The speed&nbsp; is like 3.30 it per second. I have RTX 3090 TI GPU&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHTkVm2mcfs&t=340) and I am recording a video right now. So that is&nbsp; why it is a little bit slower. But if you have&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHTkVm2mcfs&t=345) watched my TensorRT tutorial, you will see that&nbsp; you can get over 6 it about 7 it per second with&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHTkVm2mcfs&t=352) SDXL when you're generating 1024x1024 images. It&nbsp; is currently supported on Automatic1111 Web UI.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHTkVm2mcfs&t=360) But using this is super easier. Okay, we got the&nbsp; images as you are seeing right now. And they are&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHTkVm2mcfs&t=366) amazing. You see this is an amazing quality image&nbsp; with the aspect ratio we wanted. And are these&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHTkVm2mcfs&t=372) all? No. The Fooocus makes it much easier to apply&nbsp; any style fully automatically. So currently three&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHTkVm2mcfs&t=381) default styles are selected: Fooocus V2, Fooocus&nbsp; Enhance, Fooocus Sharp. So let's uncheck all of&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHTkVm2mcfs&t=387) them. And let's try other ones. For example,&nbsp; which style we would like to see let's say game&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHTkVm2mcfs&t=393) Minecraft and generate again. Okay, the generation&nbsp; has started. It was pretty fast. So we should get&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHTkVm2mcfs&t=400) amazing car in the style of game Minecraft. It&nbsp; supports so many styles. There are so many. I&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHTkVm2mcfs&t=406) will show some of them. And this is the image we&nbsp; are getting in the style of game Minecraft. Wow,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHTkVm2mcfs&t=413) it is looking really cool. Let's open it. Amazing.&nbsp; You can also click this icon to download the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHTkVm2mcfs&t=418) images. And we are getting another one. You can&nbsp; also click skip to skip that image or stop to stop&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHTkVm2mcfs&t=424) the generation. Okay, images are generating,&nbsp; amazing. Let's try another one. For example,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHTkVm2mcfs&t=431) which style we should try for an amazing car.&nbsp; Okay, let's see Doodle Art. I wonder what it will&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHTkVm2mcfs&t=438) generate. So let's hit generate. So currently,&nbsp; we are generating Doodle Art style. I wonder what&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHTkVm2mcfs&t=444) kind of image we will get. Okay, it is generating&nbsp; right now. When you select the style, it doesn't&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHTkVm2mcfs&t=449) show the final prompt here unfortunately. It is&nbsp; interesting actually, it was showing in these&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHTkVm2mcfs&t=455) styles, but not in this one. Okay, this is doodle&nbsp; art. Amazing, amazing quality. And it is looking&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHTkVm2mcfs&t=462) amazing. So read all of the styles here. Try them&nbsp; and see if you like them. The Fooocus is extremely&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHTkVm2mcfs&t=470) easy to use. And model tab. What is model tab&nbsp; for. In here you can select the base model,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHTkVm2mcfs&t=477) refiner model if you want to use or LoRAs as you&nbsp; are seeing right now. So in here you can select&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHTkVm2mcfs&t=483) base model, refiner model if you wish or LoRAs.&nbsp; Where are these models are downloaded or put. When&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHTkVm2mcfs&t=490) you enter Fooocus, enter inside models, you will&nbsp; see there are checkpoints as you are seeing here.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHTkVm2mcfs&t=496) So you can put the full models here. Let's put the&nbsp; base model here. So I have the base model inside&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHTkVm2mcfs&t=503) here. And I will put the SDXL base version 1 here.&nbsp; Where you can download this? To download it type&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHTkVm2mcfs&t=509) SDXL Base 1.0 Hugging Face. You can download it&nbsp; from anywhere. I prefer to download from Hugging&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHTkVm2mcfs&t=516) Face and in here click file and versions. In here&nbsp; you will see base version. After you put the model&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHTkVm2mcfs&t=523) here. Either restart the entire application or&nbsp; just click refresh all files and now we should see&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHTkVm2mcfs&t=530) it. Yes, I see it. I will also invalidate the LoRA&nbsp; and let's generate the same art. So now it will&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHTkVm2mcfs&t=538) change the downloaded model and it will regenerate&nbsp; the files. Let's see the output. In some cases,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHTkVm2mcfs&t=545) the base model may work better. So I suggest you&nbsp; to compare them and decide which model is working&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHTkVm2mcfs&t=552) better for you. Okay, we got the first image,&nbsp; let's download and open it and in here we got&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHTkVm2mcfs&t=557) the image. So this is the generation with the base&nbsp; model with Doodle Art. Probably base model will&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHTkVm2mcfs&t=563) work much better for different styles here than&nbsp; the fine-tuned models. Because base model is super&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHTkVm2mcfs&t=571) strong when it comes to different arts, different&nbsp; styles. Okay from here let's try Flat 2d Art. Yeah&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHTkVm2mcfs&t=578) I wonder what kind of image we will get with this&nbsp; one. Okay, we are getting the image slowly. By&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHTkVm2mcfs&t=584) the way I have selected the quality. Therefore&nbsp; it is taking longer, generates in 60 steps. You&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHTkVm2mcfs&t=591) can also use your custom trained models in this&nbsp; application all of the formats are supported. You&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHTkVm2mcfs&t=598) can also append many LoRAs as you are seeing right&nbsp; now. So this is the first image and it is looking&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHTkVm2mcfs&t=604) amazing. Really good one and here the second&nbsp; image. Wow! This one is also looking great. So&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHTkVm2mcfs&t=610) what other options there are? In the advanced tab&nbsp; you can change sampling sharpness. It says higher&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHTkVm2mcfs&t=617) value means image and texture are sharper and the&nbsp; guidance scale. This is the CFG value. You can&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHTkVm2mcfs&t=625) also enable developer debug mode. In here you see&nbsp; there are other parameters that you can play with.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHTkVm2mcfs&t=631) If you are an expert you can change all of this&nbsp; but if you are not an expert just do not spend&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHTkVm2mcfs&t=637) time with it. When you click this document it&nbsp; will show you more information regarding that tab,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHTkVm2mcfs&t=643) those options. So I suggest you to read them as&nbsp; well. So the Fooocus also supports input image.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHTkVm2mcfs&t=649) When you click here this section will be enabled.&nbsp; Click document to learn more about variation,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHTkVm2mcfs&t=657) upscale, and others stuff. So in here&nbsp; they are clearly explained. For example,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHTkVm2mcfs&t=662) let's generate an amazing dragon and try to&nbsp; upscale it. So first of all I will disable input&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHTkVm2mcfs&t=669) image and I will type majestic dragon. Okay, let's&nbsp; generate two images with 1024 base resolution and&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHTkVm2mcfs&t=677) let's generate. Oh by the way, our style is still&nbsp; selected. Therefore now it is getting generated&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHTkVm2mcfs&t=684) in Flat 2d Art. I think this section is missing a&nbsp; button. There should be uncheck all like somewhere&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHTkVm2mcfs&t=691) around here and this is the generated image.&nbsp; I will make these images in Pokemon actually,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHTkVm2mcfs&t=698) let's look for Pokemon. Yes, game Pokemon and&nbsp; let's try with game Pokemon. So let's skip this&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHTkVm2mcfs&t=704) one and generate. This time we will get majestic&nbsp; dragon in Pokemon style. I wonder what kind of&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHTkVm2mcfs&t=711) image we are going to get. Okay, we got the first&nbsp; image. It is looking pretty decent and the second&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHTkVm2mcfs&t=716) image is also coming. The second image I think&nbsp; looks more like a Pokemon and we got the image,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHTkVm2mcfs&t=722) nice. Let's enable input image and from&nbsp; documentation let's look some of the features.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHTkVm2mcfs&t=729) So it says we can drag and drop. So let's do that.&nbsp; I will drag this one. Actually it is hard to drag&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHTkVm2mcfs&t=735) and drop so let's zoom out. Okay I will drag and&nbsp; drop here. Okay, we got the image. Let's say vary&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHTkVm2mcfs&t=741) subtle. So with this way it will generate upscaled&nbsp; version but it will be a little bit different than&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHTkVm2mcfs&t=748) the original. Okay, we got the images so let's&nbsp; compare. This was the base image 1024, 1024,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHTkVm2mcfs&t=755) 1024 pixels and here we got the upscaled image.&nbsp; Oh it is still same. Okay, this didn't upscale.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHTkVm2mcfs&t=762) Oh I see, the vary will not upscale but generate&nbsp; a subtle different image based on the input image,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHTkVm2mcfs&t=771) you see. Sorry about that I was mistaken. So this&nbsp; didn't upscale but generated a subtle different&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHTkVm2mcfs&t=778) image. Okay let's try vary strong. So this will&nbsp; generate a really different image. Okay we got the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHTkVm2mcfs&t=784) images so let's compare. This was the base image&nbsp; as you are seeing right now and here we got the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHTkVm2mcfs&t=791) vary strong. So it generated another image based&nbsp; on this image and it is a similar but not exactly&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHTkVm2mcfs&t=799) and in here we got another one. All right. So&nbsp; let's try upscale. There are upscale 1.5x upscale,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHTkVm2mcfs&t=806) 2x and upscale fast. Let's upscale 2x. For upscale&nbsp; to work you don't need any prompt and you can use&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHTkVm2mcfs&t=814) your real images as well and everything you&nbsp; use will be shown in the CMD. Always look for&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHTkVm2mcfs&t=822) this command line interface which is running this&nbsp; application right now. Okay, we got the upscale&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHTkVm2mcfs&t=828) result. This was the original image and this is&nbsp; the upscaled image by 2x. Let's look at the other&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHTkVm2mcfs&t=835) things. So it says there is image prompt and there&nbsp; is advanced options of image prompt. So let's hide&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHTkVm2mcfs&t=843) the advanced options and let's look at the image&nbsp; prompt from this document. So it says that image&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHTkVm2mcfs&t=849) prompts Midjourney image prompts. It is equal&nbsp; to Midjourney image prompts. Let's look at this&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHTkVm2mcfs&t=854) example. So there is a cat and this image and this&nbsp; is the image prompt. So let's try an image prompt.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHTkVm2mcfs&t=862) I will use this image as a first image. Let's&nbsp; make this second image and let's try without any&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHTkVm2mcfs&t=868) prompt. Let's hit generate and see what we are&nbsp; going to get. According to the documentation,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHTkVm2mcfs&t=874) we should be able to use these two images as a&nbsp; prompt and we should get outputs like this. They&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHTkVm2mcfs&t=880) are looking really really amazing by the way.&nbsp; When the first time you try to generate it will&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHTkVm2mcfs&t=885) download the necessary ControlNet models.&nbsp; It is downloading IP Adapter Plus SDXL,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHTkVm2mcfs&t=892) clip_vision_vit_h safetensors, downloading another&nbsp; model. So when you first time use them they will&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHTkVm2mcfs&t=900) get downloaded. Okay, the generation started. I&nbsp; wonder what we will get. I think it is going to&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHTkVm2mcfs&t=905) make somewhat mixed of both images. Yeah, it&nbsp; looks like it is going to look great. Okay,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHTkVm2mcfs&t=911) we got the first so let's download this. Really&nbsp; really decent. So it made out something like&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHTkVm2mcfs&t=919) the mixture of both images and we are getting the&nbsp; another image. Wow, this is even looking better.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHTkVm2mcfs&t=925) So this feature is amazing. We are able to mix&nbsp; multiple images and we don't even have a prompt&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHTkVm2mcfs&t=933) here. Yeah, this is even better. Okay let's try&nbsp; like this a man and this time we are also going to&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHTkVm2mcfs&t=941) give more information. A man wearing armor. Okay&nbsp; and let's see what we will get this time. Okay,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHTkVm2mcfs&t=948) this time I think it will be even more accurate.&nbsp; Okay, we got the first image. So it tried to merge&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHTkVm2mcfs&t=955) this one and this one but the style is lost you&nbsp; see. But it is looking pretty good except the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHTkVm2mcfs&t=962) face. I think it can be even fixed. So when&nbsp; we click advanced it shows that where should&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHTkVm2mcfs&t=968) the algorithm stop and the weight of this image&nbsp; prompt. There are also other options. For example,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHTkVm2mcfs&t=976) it says we can make this as a Canny and let's try&nbsp; it as a Canny and see what we will get. By the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHTkVm2mcfs&t=983) way, since I made it as a Canny now it is going to&nbsp; download another one. Control LoRA Canny rank 128.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHTkVm2mcfs&t=990) The Fooocus developer is the ControlNet developer&nbsp; the same guy. So this guy is amazing. Amazingly&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHTkVm2mcfs&t=997) talented. You know the ControlNet models that we&nbsp; are using for SD 1.5 based models which are the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHTkVm2mcfs&t=1004) amazing ones. Okay this time it used this image as&nbsp; a Canny so the shape is kept and used this image&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHTkVm2mcfs&t=1012) more likely to change the style of the image like&nbsp; you are seeing right now. There is also inpaint or&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHTkVm2mcfs&t=1019) outpaint and this is another amazing feature. I&nbsp; will show that in a moment. Actually, let's skip&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHTkVm2mcfs&t=1025) this one. So inpaint or outpaint. With this one&nbsp; you can expand the existing images. For example,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHTkVm2mcfs&t=1033) let's expand this image and let's describe this.&nbsp; A picture of a man behind city scene. So let's&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHTkVm2mcfs&t=1042) expand it for right. Okay, let's generate. It&nbsp; will also download inpainter model as you are&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHTkVm2mcfs&t=1049) seeing right now. When you first time use this if&nbsp; they are requiring different model, they will get&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHTkVm2mcfs&t=1055) downloaded. When we click the document you can&nbsp; see how they can be used. This is the equivalent&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHTkVm2mcfs&t=1062) of the Midjourney so this application is trying&nbsp; to mimic the Midjourney as much as possible. You&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHTkVm2mcfs&t=1069) can also inpaint objects. I will also make an&nbsp; example for that. So the first image is getting&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHTkVm2mcfs&t=1076) generated. It is expanding the image into the&nbsp; right. Let's see what we will get. But this is&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHTkVm2mcfs&t=1082) a hard scene so it may not be great because the&nbsp; style is not matching. Yeah, it didn't do very&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHTkVm2mcfs&t=1088) well. Probably it would do better on a real image.&nbsp; So let's try a real image real like image. Okay,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHTkVm2mcfs&t=1096) I think this should work better. A man standing&nbsp; in a forest. Okay, let's see what we will get this&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHTkVm2mcfs&t=1103) time. I think this should work better. Okay, image&nbsp; is getting generated. Okay first image generated.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHTkVm2mcfs&t=1110) Let's download and open it. Yeah, this is much&nbsp; better than the previous one. Still not the very&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHTkVm2mcfs&t=1116) best, but much better. Probably we really need to&nbsp; define them better. Let's try without any prompt.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHTkVm2mcfs&t=1123) I wonder what we will get. Okay, without any&nbsp; prompt. I think it is still trying to match this&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHTkVm2mcfs&t=1129) style so you should uncheck all of this. So let's&nbsp; skip the existing image. Try again. Now no style&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHTkVm2mcfs&t=1137) is selected. I will also select these three styles&nbsp; here and see what difference it will make. Okay,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHTkVm2mcfs&t=1145) currently it is trying to generate without&nbsp; anything. Yeah, when you don't type any prompt,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHTkVm2mcfs&t=1151) I think it is not working good. So let's make&nbsp; these 3 and let's make a man standing in a forest&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHTkVm2mcfs&t=1158) and these 3 styles are selected and let's see the&nbsp; output. Allright! Now we got much better output&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHTkVm2mcfs&t=1166) after we selected these 3. You see it is looking&nbsp; much much better than the previous one. It is&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHTkVm2mcfs&t=1173) almost matching with the concept, so make sure&nbsp; that you have selected the accurate style from&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHTkVm2mcfs&t=1178) here and typed at least somewhat resembling prompt&nbsp; here. I think much better. Also, you can inpaint&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHTkVm2mcfs&t=1187) so let's try to inpaint. Okay, let's make the&nbsp; face someone else. Okay, let's say. Okay let's say&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHTkVm2mcfs&t=1195) photo of a famous actor and generate so let's see&nbsp; what we will get. Okay, we got the first image,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHTkVm2mcfs&t=1202) let's download. This is the result we got. I can't&nbsp; say it is very best. I would expect it to perform&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHTkVm2mcfs&t=1209) better actually and the second one is also coming&nbsp; up. You can use any model with this application&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHTkVm2mcfs&t=1216) SD 1.5, Realistic Vision, Rev Animated, whatever&nbsp; you wish. It supports all. Okay, this is another&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHTkVm2mcfs&t=1223) one. Not very good either. So what i'm going to do&nbsp; is now. I am going to try realistic and let's see&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHTkVm2mcfs&t=1230) the difference with realistic model you see. It&nbsp; depends on the which base model it is using. The&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHTkVm2mcfs&t=1237) realistic will use realistic stock photo version&nbsp; 10 save tensor file. This is also stxl model. All&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHTkVm2mcfs&t=1245) right. Realistic model started. Let's try amazing&nbsp; car and let's change the aspect ratio from here. I&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHTkVm2mcfs&t=1254) will make it like this: okay, so you see it, added&nbsp; some default negative prompt in this model and&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHTkVm2mcfs&t=1262) let's see what we are going to get. Okay the first&nbsp; image here. Let's download it. Yeah it is looking&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHTkVm2mcfs&t=1268) pretty realistic and currently these styles&nbsp; are selected. Fooocus V2, Fooocus Photograph,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHTkVm2mcfs&t=1275) Fooocus Negative. Okay and this is another&nbsp; image. Wow! this is really really good and it&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHTkVm2mcfs&t=1281) is using this base model, this LoRA and these&nbsp; are the weights and these are the sampling,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHTkVm2mcfs&t=1288) sharpness and guidance scale. Okay, I wonder&nbsp; how big images it can generate so let's try this&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHTkVm2mcfs&t=1295) resolution and let's look at the it per second.&nbsp; Okay, the it doesn't change much because when&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHTkVm2mcfs&t=1302) you multiply these numbers they are almost each&nbsp; time making it equal to 1 megapixels which is the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHTkVm2mcfs&t=1310) default resolution of the SDXL, Stable Diffusion&nbsp; XL model. Okay here another image. I think I will&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHTkVm2mcfs&t=1318) change the prompt a little bit. Amazing expensive&nbsp; sports car. Okay, let's look at the result so we&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHTkVm2mcfs&t=1326) should get more like recent cars, not the older&nbsp; cars. Okay, this is the first image we are going&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHTkVm2mcfs&t=1334) to get. All right, let's look at it. Lets download&nbsp; and open. This is the image and another one is&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHTkVm2mcfs&t=1341) upcoming. So what change it is with the different&nbsp; selected model, default styles, the default&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHTkVm2mcfs&t=1348) selected styles, and the model, nothing else.&nbsp; Let's also start the anime model. By the way,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHTkVm2mcfs&t=1354) all of these are written and explained in the&nbsp; readme of the Fooocus GitHub repository. So you&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHTkVm2mcfs&t=1360) should read everything here. Believe me, there are&nbsp; so many important information here. For example,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHTkVm2mcfs&t=1367) the default models are explained here as you are&nbsp; seeing right now. The anime run will use this&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHTkVm2mcfs&t=1374) model and there are also list of hidden tricks&nbsp; here. You can also read them, they are really&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHTkVm2mcfs&t=1380) important. There are also customization option&nbsp; which are explained. Everything is pretty well&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHTkVm2mcfs&t=1386) explained. This readme file is amazing. So now it&nbsp; is going to download the Blue Pencil XL model and&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHTkVm2mcfs&t=1394) it is also going to apply a refiner. You see as&nbsp; a refiner it is downloading Dream Shaper version&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHTkVm2mcfs&t=1400) 8 so you can also use SD 1.5 based models as a&nbsp; refiner. That is amazing. This is a feature of&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHTkVm2mcfs&t=1410) this Fooocus Web UI to use Stable Diffusion. So&nbsp; the interface has started. Let's type our prompt:&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHTkVm2mcfs&t=1418) a male hero. I am not going to do any advanced&nbsp; or anything and let's see what we are going to&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHTkVm2mcfs&t=1424) get. Okay it is generating. This is going to be an&nbsp; anime model. Okay, the first 20 steps and then 10&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHTkVm2mcfs&t=1432) steps and then it is going to generate. Yeah,&nbsp; it generated refined too. Wow the quality is&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHTkVm2mcfs&t=1439) looking amazing. Really really amazing. The anime&nbsp; model is the best among others so far and this&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHTkVm2mcfs&t=1446) is the another image. Let's try another thing.&nbsp; A male warrior robot. Okay and let's change the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHTkVm2mcfs&t=1454) aspect ratio. For example, let's make it like&nbsp; this: okay, you see now it has negative prompt&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHTkVm2mcfs&t=1461) with embedding. So it is using this embedding&nbsp; unaesthetic and these other prompts. Okay,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHTkVm2mcfs&t=1468) we are getting the image all right. So first&nbsp; generate and do refining. Okay, the aspect ratio&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHTkVm2mcfs&t=1475) matters a lot. I think the quality is broken&nbsp; compared to the previous and these are the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHTkVm2mcfs&t=1481) selected styles Fooocus V2, Fooocus Masterpiece&nbsp; and the selected model here, select the refiner&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHTkVm2mcfs&t=1487) here. Refiner switch which means that based on&nbsp; the number of steps after this percentage of&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHTkVm2mcfs&t=1494) steps it will do refining and this is the appended&nbsp; LoRA and these are the advanced tab. You see this&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHTkVm2mcfs&t=1501) time it is using guidance scale more. Let's make&nbsp; the aspect ratio to default 1024. Let's look at&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHTkVm2mcfs&t=1509) the it (iteration). Okay now I can see the prompt&nbsp; expansion here. Wow, I think this will be really&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHTkVm2mcfs&t=1515) really good. Okay let's look at the quality. Wow&nbsp; the quality is really good. It is really good and&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHTkVm2mcfs&t=1522) here another one we are getting. Okay. Amazing!&nbsp; I think what this Web UI is lacking right now:&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHTkVm2mcfs&t=1530) able to queue multiple prompts trying each one of&nbsp; the styles here. I think the developer should add&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHTkVm2mcfs&t=1538) trying all of the styles here one by one so you&nbsp; can generate with every style and see which one&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHTkVm2mcfs&t=1543) of them are performing better. Maybe combination&nbsp; of styles, generate hundreds, thousands of images&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHTkVm2mcfs&t=1550) and find the very best styles. I think that would&nbsp; be even better, but for now this is what we got. I&nbsp;&nbsp;
