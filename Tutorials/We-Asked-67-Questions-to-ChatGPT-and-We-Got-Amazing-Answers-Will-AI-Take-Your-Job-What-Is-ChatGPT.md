In this video, I am asking 67 different style questions to the ChatGPT. Some of them are very difficult to answer even for human experts in that area. The answers provided by ChatGPT are just amazing and also in a sense terrifying.

I predict that, in the future, AI will replace a lot of professions and cause a lot of unemployment.

### Video Transcription


- [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=0) Hello everyone. I am Dr. Furkan Gözükara.&nbsp; In this video, I will test the capabilities&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=4) of ChatGPT which is the newest release of&nbsp; OpenAI. I will ask tons of different style&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=9) questions. I guarantee you will enjoy and get very&nbsp; surprised by the answers of ChatGPT. Currently,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=15) it is free to test with a free OpenAI account. I&nbsp; will add all of the questions as video chapters&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=21) into the description so you can quickly jump and&nbsp; see the questions that are interesting to you.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=26) Also, I will explain what is ChatGPT in&nbsp; details in the later part of the video. Let's&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=31) quickly start asking questions and testing its&nbsp; capabilities. Ok, here comes the first question.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=55) Ok, the question we have asked is, write me&nbsp; a complete software in C-sharp that will read&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=61) the data from Excel xlsx files into data table&nbsp; objects. The answer is: Sure here is a complete&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=71) C-sharp program that reads the data from an Excel&nbsp; xlsx file and stores it in a data table object.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=78) When we analyze the software, it gives a&nbsp; path, it uses OleDbConnection and let's see.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=88) So it uses Microsoft OleDb, file path,&nbsp; connection open, data table, OleDb adapter.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=97) Ok, so let's also try with another version answer.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=113) Ok, it used again OleDb adapter. Perhaps we can&nbsp; ask in a different way. to get a better answer.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=122) Write me a complete software in C-sharp&nbsp; that will read data from Excel files into&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=128) data table objects by using Nuget packages.&nbsp; Alright, this time it has used ExcelDataReader&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=150) library, so you can get different types of&nbsp; answers, but it works. So let's move to our&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=159) next question.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=166) So our next question is Compose a ballade about&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=169) Ezzio Auditore from Assassin's&nbsp; Creed. Lets read the answer.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=177) In the streets of Renaissance Italy, Lived a&nbsp; man named Ezzio Auditore, A skilled assassin and&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=181) master of blades, Feared and respected by one and&nbsp; all. He hailed from a noble family, But fate had&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=187) other plans for him, As his father and brothers&nbsp; were killed, Leaving Ezzio to seek revenge.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=192) With a thirst for justice and truth, Ezzio trained&nbsp; himself to be the best, Mastering the art of&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=197) assassination, And wielding his hidden blade&nbsp; with finesse. He fought against the Templars,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=199) Protecting the creed of his ancestors, With his&nbsp; trusty companions by his side, He battled his&nbsp;&nbsp; way to the top. Ezzio Auditore, brave and bold,&nbsp; A hero of the Italian Renaissance, His name will&nbsp;&nbsp; be remembered for centuries, As the greatest&nbsp; assassin of all time. Ok, so let's move to our&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=204) next question which is a paragraph compilation&nbsp; question that is usually asked in English exams.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=217) Ok, let's read the question. Which answer is&nbsp; correct to complete the following paragraph&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=225) and why? The degree to which children feel more&nbsp; self-confident as they grow older depends mainly&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=230) on their relation with their mothers and fathers.&nbsp; Children always need to be reassured by their&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=234) parents. _____. This kind of trust is essential&nbsp; in reducing young children's anxiety. A) They need&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=242) to believe that their parents will love them no&nbsp; matter what they do B) Anxieties are common even&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=246) in the early years of childhood C) They may begin&nbsp; to cry if one of the parents goes away even for a&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=250) short while D) Any suggestion of forcing children&nbsp; to overcome a fear will only make it last longer&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=254) E) So parents should scold their children whenever&nbsp; they want A) They need to believe that their&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=264) parents will love them no matter what they do&nbsp; is the correct answer to complete the paragraph.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=268) This statement is supported by the previous&nbsp; sentence stating that children need to be&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=271) reassured by their parents and the subsequent&nbsp; sentence discussing the importance of trust&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=275) in reducing anxiety. The other options do not&nbsp; directly relate to the topic of the paragraph and&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=280) do not support the idea of a positive relationship&nbsp; between parents and children reducing anxiety. Ok,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=284) as you can see the open gpt, the chat gpt is&nbsp; providing us a very detailed answer as well.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=292) Ok, so let's ask another type of&nbsp; question. List to me some of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=298) best pc games that are both fun to play&nbsp; and that will improve my English level.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=306) Ok, when we analyze the games, The Sims 4,&nbsp; it's a simulation game which has a lot of&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=310) text and that will surely improve your English.&nbsp; Bioshock Infinite could improve your English&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=316) with a quest. Fallout 4 will surely improve&nbsp; your English or the Elder Scrolls Skyrim.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=324) As you can see, you can get ideas as well.&nbsp; So let's ask another type of question.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=331) How diablo 3 immortal exploits people’s&nbsp; weakness with its box opening system?&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=340) Ok, here we have an interesting answer. Diablo&nbsp; 3's immortal box opening system exploits people's&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=349) weakness for gambling and the thrill of potential&nbsp; rewards. The system allows players to use in-game&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=354) currency or real money to purchase boxes that&nbsp; contain random, potentially valuable items.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=358) This creates a sense of excitement and&nbsp; anticipation as players open the boxes,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=362) but the chances of receiving&nbsp; a valuable item are often low.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=365) This can lead to players spending more and&nbsp; more money or in-game currency in an attempt&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=369) to get the desired reward, ultimately leading&nbsp; to potential financial loss. The system preys&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=373) on people's desire for instant gratification&nbsp; and the allure of potential rewards, ultimately&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=377) exploiting their weakness for gambling. Alright,&nbsp; so let's ask another grammar test in English.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=392) In this one, the answer of the chatGPT is&nbsp; incorrect, actually. The answer is whose daughter,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=400) however, chat gpt thinks that it is whom. So&nbsp; we can't totally trust the answers of chat gpt,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=408) but it is really good in some of the cases.&nbsp; For example, let's ask this question.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=422) In this one, it answers it correctly. Let's&nbsp; read it. Which answer is correct to complete the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=428) following paragraph and why? .............. rich&nbsp; people are, they never seem satisfied with their&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=432) lot and are always anxious to make ...............&nbsp; more money. A) No matter how / still B) Although&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=438) / some C) So much / so much D) Many / much E)&nbsp; Whoever / that Ok, so the answer it gives us.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=447) A) No matter how / still is the correct&nbsp; answer to complete the paragraph.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=451) This phrase accurately completes the sentence by&nbsp; stating that rich people are never satisfied with&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=455) their wealth and are always seeking to make more&nbsp; money. The other options do not make grammatically&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=460) correct sentences or do not accurately&nbsp; describe the behavior of rich people. Ok,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=464) and the answer is correct. So let's ask&nbsp; another complex question in programming.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=473) How to compose a Periodic Background Task in ASP&nbsp; .NET Core? Explain with details and code examples.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=485) By the way, in Chrome, this&nbsp; output is working better.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=491) However, in Internet Explorer, it has&nbsp; some problems. It is not fully complete.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=500) OK, so it has provided us a detailed answer. To&nbsp; create a periodic background task in ASP.NET Core,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=509) you can use the IHostedService interface and the&nbsp; BackgroundService class. First, you need to create&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=514) a new class that implements the IHostedService&nbsp; interface. This class will contain the logic&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=519) for your background task, such as sending emails&nbsp; or performing database maintenance. Here is an&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=524) example of a simple background task that prints&nbsp; a message to the console every 5 seconds. OK,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=528) and you can read the answer. You can try it if it&nbsp; is working or not. It also explains other parts.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=537) Next, you need to register your background&nbsp; task with the Dependency Injection (DI)&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=540) container in the ConfigureServices method of&nbsp; your Startup class. You can do this by calling&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=545) the AddHostedService method. Finally, you need to&nbsp; ensure that your application has a long-running&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=553) host. By default, ASP.NET Core web applications&nbsp; run in a short-lived host that is terminated&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=558) after a request has been processed. You can change&nbsp; this behavior by calling the UseIISIntegration or&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=562) UseKestrel methods in the Configure method of your&nbsp; Startup class. OK, this may not be fully complete,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=568) but it will give you a lot of idea to where to&nbsp; look and do. So let's also ask some hard lead&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=575) code programming questions that are frequently&nbsp; asked in interviews. OK, I have opened the lead&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=582) code problems section. So from here, let's ask&nbsp; a hard question which is categorized as hard&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=592) median of two sorted arrays. So the full&nbsp; question I am going to copy and paste it.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=604) Given two sorted arrays nums1 and nums2&nbsp; of size m and n respectively, return the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=610) median of the two sorted arrays. The overall&nbsp; run time complexity should be O(log (m+n)).&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=618) So it is providing us an answer with code and&nbsp; the description. To find the median of two&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=627) sorted arrays in O(log (m+n)) time complexity,&nbsp; you can use a modified binary search algorithm.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=633) First, you need to determine the size of&nbsp; the combined array by adding the lengths&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=636) of the two input arrays. Then, you can use binary&nbsp; search to find the median of the combined array.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=643) To do this, you can start by setting the minimum&nbsp; and maximum index values to 0 and the length of&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=647) the combined array, respectively. You can see&nbsp; it is even explaining us how the code runs. So&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=654) I'm going to copy and paste the generated code and&nbsp; let's see if it is working in the LeetCode or not.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=660) OK, and let's submit.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=665) OK, it says that we have an error. OK, actually&nbsp; last time when I have tried it, it was working.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=678) Oh, sorry, sorry, it is accepted.&nbsp; It is accepted in C sharp, but it&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=682) is failed in C++. So our answer is working.&nbsp; Perfect. Let's ask another hard question.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=692) OK, this question is regular expression&nbsp; matching. I am copying and pasting it.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=698) Let's see how it does. Given an&nbsp; input string s and a pattern p,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=706) implement regular expression matching with&nbsp; support for '.' and '*' where. And the rest&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=713) of the question is here. If you want to read, it&nbsp; is even giving us an explanation. To implement&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=720) regular expression matching with support for&nbsp; '.' and '*', you can use a recursive approach.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=724) First, you need to check if the input string&nbsp; is empty. If it is, you can return true if the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=729) pattern is also empty, or false if the pattern is&nbsp; not empty. Next, you need to check if the pattern&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=735) is empty. If it is, you can return false, as&nbsp; the input string must not be empty in this case.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=742) Then, you can check if the next character in&nbsp; the pattern is a ''. If it is, you can call&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=747) the matching function with the input string&nbsp; and the pattern without the '' character,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=750) as the '' character can match zero characters in&nbsp; the input string. OK, as you can see, it is fully&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=755) explaining. It looks awesome. So let's copy and&nbsp; paste the code to see if it is working or not.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=762) OK, is match. OK, let's run it.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=770) Oh, we have a compiler error.&nbsp; It thinks that this code is C++.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=778) OK, we have some, of course, string&nbsp; here as copy code. OK, let's run again.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=790) OK. Where is our error? By the way, maybe we&nbsp; should ask this in Csharp or other language.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=806) OK, let's see. Oh, maybe I need to change this&nbsp; into Csharp. OK. Let's copy paste again. OK.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=825) And. OK.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=834) Sorry about that. This is getting&nbsp; I am making a mistake here. OK.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=849) OK, in C sharp, it has failed to provide&nbsp; the answer is wrong, but it still gives us&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=854) an idea. Also, it was a hard question. Maybe we&nbsp; can ask another one, but let's move different&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=862) types of questions because now we understand&nbsp; it. OK, I will ask another type of question.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=874) And let's see. List me some animes&nbsp; that are like Naruto: Shippuden.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=882) And it gives me a list: Dragon Ball Z, One&nbsp; Piece, Fairy Tail, Attack on Titan, Bleach,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=888) My Hero Academia, Fullmetal Alchemist, Hunter&nbsp; X Hunter, One Punch Man and Yu-Gi-Oh! I can say&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=895) some of them are really close. For example, One&nbsp; Piece perhaps or Bleach, but still gives you an&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=903) idea. And let's ask another type of question.&nbsp; How can I get rid of drinking addiction?&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=915) OK, let's read the answer here. To get rid of&nbsp; drinking addiction, it is important to seek&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=923) professional help and support. You can start&nbsp; by talking to your doctor or a mental health&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=927) professional, who can help you assess your level&nbsp; of addiction and recommend treatment options.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=932) Treatment for alcohol addiction may include&nbsp; individual or group therapy, medication to reduce&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=936) cravings, and support groups such as Alcoholics&nbsp; Anonymous. It is also important to develop healthy&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=941) coping strategies and avoid triggers that may lead&nbsp; to drinking. OK, so now I will ask another type of&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=950) question, a programming question and I want it&nbsp; to be solved within a certain type complexity.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=967) Wow, as you can see, it is displaying us a full&nbsp; solution with explanation. To find the median of&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=978) two sorted arrays in O(log (m+n)) time complexity,&nbsp; you can use a modified binary search algorithm.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=984) First, you need to determine the size of the&nbsp; combined array by adding the lengths of the two&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=988) input arrays. Then, you can use binary search&nbsp; to find the median of the combined array. OK,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=993) so let's move to another question. This one is&nbsp; a health related question, a medical question.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=999) Actually, I got this question from my father who&nbsp; is an associate professor in internal diseases.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=1009) Provide me as a list of the most probable&nbsp; but specific 10 disease names that would&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=1014) have the following symptoms: frequent urination,&nbsp; darkening of urine color, headache, weakness,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=1021) dry mouth and get tired easily. So it gives&nbsp; us some of the possible diseases. However,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=1031) these are not including one of the diseases that&nbsp; my father told. Porphyria is written like this.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=1042) Let's ask another one, but in this one&nbsp; it will provide us a correct answer.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=1054) Like this. Provide me as a list of the most&nbsp; probable but specific 10 disease names that&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=1059) would have the following symptoms: I have&nbsp; tested this previously, therefore I know it.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=1067) OK, the answer should contain.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=1075) It's hard to read for me. Oh, this time it&nbsp; didn't tell it. The answer was this one.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=1085) OK, so with health related questions,&nbsp; it is still not working very well,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=1091) but it might give idea to doctors, medical&nbsp; doctors. And if the medical doctor know&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=1099) that and see that he or she can remember it&nbsp; quickly. So this system could be used for&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=1110) medical expert system. Actually, it was&nbsp; this one. Sorry about that. Let me show.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=1117) In this case, it is going to give us a correct&nbsp; list, I believe. It is taking some time.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=1134) OK, I leave these to medical&nbsp; doctors. I'm not sure because.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=1139) So let's try to deceive the system with a&nbsp; non-historical event and say that it is historical&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=1148) fact. Write me the historical facts and how it had&nbsp; happened “the alien invasion occurred in 1890”.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=1164) OK, the answer is as expected. It is not&nbsp; possible to provide historical facts and&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=1169) details about an event that did not actually&nbsp; occur. The concept of an alien invasion&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=1175) occurring in 1890 is a fictional scenario&nbsp; and has no basis in historical fact. OK,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=1183) so let's ask another type of question. Write me&nbsp; the story of the man that can breathe underwater.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=1191) OK, it generated a fictional story. There once was&nbsp; a man named Jack who had the ability to breathe&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=1198) underwater. He had always been fascinated by the&nbsp; ocean and its creatures, and as a child he would&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=1202) often spend hours at the beach, watching the waves&nbsp; crash against the shore and the fish swim by.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=1207) One day, while swimming in the ocean, Jack&nbsp; discovered that he could hold his breath for&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=1211) much longer than anyone else he knew. He was&nbsp; able to swim down to the depths of the sea&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=1215) and explore the vibrant coral reefs without&nbsp; ever feeling the need to come up for air.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=1220) At first, Jack thought he was just lucky or that&nbsp; he had developed exceptional lung capacity. But as&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=1224) time went on, he realized that he had a special&nbsp; ability that allowed him to breathe underwater.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=1229) Jack was overjoyed by his newfound power and&nbsp; decided to use it to explore the ocean and&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=1233) learn more about its mysteries. He spent&nbsp; hours diving down to the ocean floor,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=1237) discovering new species of fish and plants and&nbsp; marveling at the beauty of the underwater world.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=1242) However, Jack also faced challenges. Some people&nbsp; were skeptical of his ability and thought he was&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=1247) lying or delusional. Others were jealous of his&nbsp; power and tried to harm him or steal his secret.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=1252) But Jack remained determined and continued&nbsp; to explore the depths of the ocean,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=1255) always amazed by the wonders he discovered there.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=1259) In the end, Jack became known as the man who could&nbsp; breathe underwater, a legend in the world of ocean&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=1263) exploration. He continued to explore the depths&nbsp; of the sea and share his knowledge with others,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=1267) always grateful for his unique ability and the&nbsp; adventures it had allowed him to experience.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=1272) Ok as you can see, it sounds very convincing,&nbsp; however, it is a fictional story. OK,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=1281) so let's ask another type of question&nbsp; and see if it is working or not.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=1287) I am asking the sea level of&nbsp; the following coordinates.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=1293) Ok it says that it is not able to provide such&nbsp; coordinates and let's ask another question.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=1301) Write me a rap song related to programming.&nbsp; Okay, an interesting question and let's see&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=1306) the answer that it is going to provide&nbsp; us. Okay, let's read the answer.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=1312) Verse 1: I'm a programmer, yeah that's my game&nbsp; I code all day, it's all the same From Java to&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=1317) Python, C# to C++ I know my way around the&nbsp; tech world, no need for a map Chorus: Code,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=1324) code, code, that's all I do Write algorithms, make&nbsp; things new Debugging and testing, never stop I'm a&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=1329) programmer, I'm on the top Verse 2: I write code&nbsp; for websites, apps, and games I solve problems,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=1336) make things new I'm always learning, always&nbsp; growing In the tech world, I'm never slowing&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=1341) Chorus: Code, code, code, that's all I do Write&nbsp; algorithms, make things new Debugging and testing,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=1347) never stop I'm a programmer, I'm on the top&nbsp; Bridge: I write code, I make things work In&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=1353) the tech world, I am the boss I never stop,&nbsp; I never quit I'm a programmer, and I'm the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=1357) real deal As you can see, it is really actually&nbsp; sounding fun. If a real rapper were reading this,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=1365) it could be a hit song, perhaps, I'm not sure. So&nbsp; let's ask another question. Explain me in details&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=1373) step by step how to become a successful&nbsp; educator in YouTube. Sorry about that.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=1381) Okay, I have mistakenly clicked try again&nbsp; so it has written us another rap song.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=1389) You can pause the video and read it if&nbsp; you want. Let's get our new question.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=1396) Okay, it has provided us a detailed answer.&nbsp; Let's read it. To become a successful educator on&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=1402) YouTube, you need to have a passion for teaching&nbsp; and a strong knowledge of your subject matter.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=1406) Here are some steps to follow: Define your niche:&nbsp; Identify the specific topic or subject you want to&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=1411) teach, and focus on creating videos that provide&nbsp; valuable information and insights on that topic.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=1416) This will help you attract a specific audience&nbsp; and establish yourself as an expert in your field.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=1421) Create engaging content: Develop a content&nbsp; plan that includes a variety of video formats,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=1426) such as tutorials, lectures, demonstrations,&nbsp; and interviews. Use visuals, animation,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=1431) and other multimedia elements to enhance&nbsp; your videos and make them more engaging.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=1435) Optimize your videos for search: Use&nbsp; keywords and tags in your video titles,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=1439) descriptions, and tags to make your videos more&nbsp; discoverable on YouTube and other search engines.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=1444) This will help you attract more viewers&nbsp; and subscribers. Engage with your audience:&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=1449) Respond to comments, answer questions, and&nbsp; encourage feedback from your viewers. This will&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=1453) help you build a community of engaged followers&nbsp; who will support and promote your content.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=1458) Collaborate with other educators: Partner with&nbsp; other educators on YouTube who share your passion&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=1462) and expertise. This will help you expand&nbsp; your reach and gain access to new audiences.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=1467) Track your performance: Use YouTube analytics&nbsp; and other tools to track the performance of&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=1471) your videos and audience engagement. This will&nbsp; help you identify what is working and what needs&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=1476) to be improved, and make adjustments&nbsp; to your content strategy accordingly.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=1479) Keep learning and improving: Stay up to&nbsp; date with the latest trends, technologies,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=1483) and best practices in education and YouTube, and&nbsp; continuously improve your skills and knowledge.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=1488) This will help you stay relevant and effective&nbsp; as an educator on YouTube. Well, all of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=1495) things that it lists are so&nbsp; true. It's an excellent answer.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=1499) So let's ask another type of question,&nbsp; which is a hard one. Convert the below&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=1505) code that is written in csharp into&nbsp; python equivalent. OK, and let's see.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=1514) And as you can see, it is&nbsp; writing the equivalent code.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=1519) I didn't test it, but it could be correct. Note&nbsp; that the Lazy class is not built-in to Python,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=1526) so you would need to define it or use a&nbsp; third-party implementation. Also, the code&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=1530) above uses a lambda function to create the list&nbsp; of numbers, which is equivalent to the code in&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=1534) C# using the Enumerable.Range and Select methods.&nbsp; So you see it's an awesome explanation as well.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=1542) OK, let's ask another type of question. Write&nbsp; me a detailed lengthy article regarding the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=1548) following C# concepts: * How to define an array of&nbsp; an object type * How to access a certain element&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=1554) of the array (array indexes) OK, it has provided&nbsp; us an excellent answer with code examples.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=1562) C# allows you to define arrays of object types,&nbsp; which are collections of objects that can be&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=1566) accessed and manipulated using an index.&nbsp; This is a useful feature of the language,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=1570) as it allows you to store and work with&nbsp; multiple objects in a single variable.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=1575) To define an array of an object type, you use&nbsp; the syntax: Type[] arrayName = new Type[size];&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=1582) where Type is the type of the objects you&nbsp; want to store in the array, arrayName is&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=1586) the name of the array variable, and size is&nbsp; the number of elements the array can hold.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=1590) For example, you could define an array of strings&nbsp; as follows: string[] names = new string[10];&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=1597) This creates an array of strings with a size&nbsp; of 10, which means it can hold up to 10 string&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=1601) objects. Once you have defined an array of an&nbsp; object type, you can access and manipulate its&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=1606) elements using array indexes. An array index is&nbsp; a zero-based integer value that specifies the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=1611) position of an element in the array. For example,&nbsp; if you have an array of strings with a size of 10,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=1616) the first element (index 0) will be at the&nbsp; beginning of the array, the second element (index&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=1620) 1) will be the next element, and so on. To access&nbsp; a certain element of an array, you use the syntax:&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=1627) arrayName[index]; where arrayName is the name&nbsp; of the array and index is the zero-based index&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=1632) of the element you want to access. For&nbsp; example, to access the first element of&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=1637) the array of strings defined above, you would use&nbsp; the following code: string firstName = names[0];&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=1644) This will retrieve the string object at index 0 of&nbsp; the array and store it in the variable firstName.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=1650) In addition to accessing elements of an array,&nbsp; you can also modify them using array indexes.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=1654) For example, you could use the following code to&nbsp; change the first element of the array of strings&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=1658) to a new value: names[0] = "John"; This will&nbsp; update the string object at index 0 of the array&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=1666) to the new value "John". You can also use array&nbsp; indexes to add and remove elements from an array.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=1672) To add an element to the array, you can use&nbsp; the syntax: arrayName[index] = value; where&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=1678) value is the object you want to add to the array.&nbsp; This will add the object at the specified index,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=1683) shifting all subsequent elements to the right.&nbsp; For example, to add the string "Jane" at index&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=1688) 1 of the array of strings, you could use the&nbsp; following code: OK, so next question is a hard&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=1693) question. Write me the necessary code in C# to&nbsp; get weather data and send it to a Telegram chat&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=1699) group. Let's see what kind of output it is&nbsp; going to give us. So it is writing the code.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=1709) By the way, this output is much better in Google&nbsp; Chrome. I don't know why it is not working very&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=1715) well in latest version: Edge, Microsoft Edge.&nbsp; OK, OK, so the code is here, as you can see.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=1727) It would probably work. Yes, it looks pretty&nbsp; correct. It also explains how the code works.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=1735) So you can quickly generate your code and check&nbsp; if it is working. And if not, you can fix it.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=1742) All right, let's move to the new question. So&nbsp; our next question is an artistic one. Write me&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=1751) a poem regarding C sharp programming. Let's&nbsp; see what kind of poem we are going to get.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=1758) OK, let's read the answer. I am the language of&nbsp; the future, A tool for the bold and the curious,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=1764) A way to bend the world to our will,&nbsp; To create and innovate, to thrill.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=1768) With C#, the possibilities are endless,&nbsp; A universe of code waiting to be written,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=1772) A language that can do it all, From&nbsp; games and apps to websites and more.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=1776) With C#, we can build and design, To make the&nbsp; world a better place, To solve problems and create&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=1781) solutions, To leave our mark on the digital space.&nbsp; So come and join the C# revolution, A language&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=1787) that will take you to the stars, A language&nbsp; that will unleash your potential, A language&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=1790) that will change the world. Haha, It is a very&nbsp; good poem if you ask me. OK, let's ask another&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=1799) type of question that a student would ask. How&nbsp; to pass calculus exam without studying calculus?&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=1809) OK, so let's read the answer. It is not possible&nbsp; to pass a calculus exam without studying calculus.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=1816) Calculus is a branch of mathematics that&nbsp; involves the study of limits, derivatives,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=1820) integrals, and infinite series. It is a complex&nbsp; and challenging subject that requires dedicated&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=1825) study and practice to master. Attempting&nbsp; to pass a calculus exam without studying&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=1829) calculus is likely to result in failure. The&nbsp; only way to successfully pass a calculus exam&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=1834) is to study and understand the material covered&nbsp; in the course. OK, this is a true answer, so&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=1842) let's ask another type of question. How to&nbsp; cook the best meal with just meat and salt?&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=1849) You can expect this for other types&nbsp; of meals. Let's see the answer.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=1859) OK, it is providing us a detailed&nbsp; answer and let's see the answer.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=1869) To cook the best meal with just meat and salt,&nbsp; you can try grilling or roasting the meat over&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=1873) high heat. This will sear the outside of the&nbsp; meat and create a crispy, flavorful crust,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=1878) while leaving the inside tender and juicy. To&nbsp; grill the meat, preheat your grill to high heat&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=1883) and season the meat with salt on both sides.&nbsp; Place the meat on the grill and cook for several&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=1887) minutes on each side, until it is cooked to your&nbsp; desired level of doneness. To roast the meat,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=1892) preheat your oven to 400°F and season the meat&nbsp; with salt on both sides. Place the meat in a&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=1897) roasting pan and roast for 20-30 minutes, or until&nbsp; it is cooked to your desired level of doneness.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=1903) Regardless of how you cook the meat, be sure&nbsp; to let it rest for a few minutes before slicing&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=1907) and serving to allow the juices to redistribute.&nbsp; This will help ensure that the meat is juicy and&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=1911) tender. To add some variety to your meal, you can&nbsp; also try marinating the meat in a mixture of herbs&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=1916) and spices, such as rosemary, garlic, and black&nbsp; pepper, before cooking. This will add additional&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=1922) flavor and depth to the meat. Overall, cooking&nbsp; the best meal with just meat and salt requires&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=1927) carefully selecting the meat and using high heat&nbsp; to sear the outside and create a flavorful crust.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=1931) With a little creativity and attention to detail,&nbsp; you can create a delicious and satisfying meal.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=1936) Actually, this is something that I didn't know&nbsp; previously, so you can learn a lot of things with&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=1943) this one. So we can also ask the specific meals&nbsp; such as: How to prepare best tasting Caesar Salad?&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=1952) Okay, it has provided us the answer. To&nbsp; prepare the best tasting Caesar Salad,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=1958) you will need the following ingredients: 1&nbsp; head of romaine lettuce, washed and dried&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=1964) 1 cup of homemade or high-quality store-bought&nbsp; Caesar dressing 1 cup of croutons (homemade or&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=1970) store-bought) 1 cup of grated Parmesan cheese&nbsp; 2-3 anchovy fillets, finely minced (optional)&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=1978) To prepare the salad, first cut the romaine&nbsp; lettuce into bite-sized pieces and place&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=1982) them in a large salad bowl. Next, add the Caesar&nbsp; dressing, croutons, and grated Parmesan cheese,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=1987) and toss everything together to combine. If&nbsp; you want to add anchovy fillets to the salad,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=1992) finely mince them and mix them into&nbsp; the dressing before tossing the salad.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=1996) This will add a salty, savory flavor to the&nbsp; salad. Okay, so let's move to our next question.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=2004) What is the best way of losing weight&nbsp; meanwhile keeping muscle mass? This is a&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=2009) highly asked question in Fitness. And let's see&nbsp; what kind of answer we are going to get. Okay,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=2017) it is writing us the answer. Okay, let's read&nbsp; it. The best way to lose weight while maintaining&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=2022) muscle mass is to combine a healthy, balanced&nbsp; diet with regular strength training exercises.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=2027) To lose weight, it is important to create&nbsp; a calorie deficit, which means consuming&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=2031) fewer calories than your body burns. This can be&nbsp; achieved by reducing your intake of high-calorie,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=2036) processed foods and increasing your consumption of&nbsp; nutrient-dense, whole foods, such as vegetables,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=2040) fruits, lean proteins, and healthy fats. In&nbsp; addition to a healthy diet, regular strength&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=2046) training exercises can help you lose weight and&nbsp; maintain muscle mass. Strength training exercises,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=2051) such as weightlifting, resistance band exercises,&nbsp; and bodyweight exercises, can help you build and&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=2056) maintain muscle mass, which can boost your&nbsp; metabolism and help you burn more calories.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=2061) To maximize the benefits of strength training,&nbsp; aim to include at least 2-3 strength training&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=2065) sessions in your weekly workout routine, focusing&nbsp; on major muscle groups, such as the legs, chest,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=2070) back, and core. Overall, the key to losing&nbsp; weight while maintaining muscle mass is to&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=2075) combine a healthy, balanced diet with&nbsp; regular strength training exercises.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=2079) This approach will help you lose weight, maintain&nbsp; muscle mass, and improve your overall health and&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=2084) fitness. Excellent answer. We can also expand&nbsp; this question and answer with. Which exercises&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=2095) builds most muscle mass with&nbsp; the least amount of work?&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=2108) Okay, let's ask it. Okay, we are getting&nbsp; another example and it lists squats,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=2118) bench press, deadlifts, and yes, excellent answer.&nbsp; The exercises that build the most muscle mass with&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=2125) the least amount of work are compound exercises,&nbsp; which involve multiple joints and muscle groups.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=2130) Examples of compound exercises that are&nbsp; effective for building muscle mass include:&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=2135) Squats: Squats are a compound exercise&nbsp; that targets the legs, hips, and glutes,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=2140) and also engages the core, lower back, and upper&nbsp; body muscles. To perform squats, stand with your&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=2145) feet shoulder-width apart, and then lower your&nbsp; body as if you were sitting back into a chair.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=2149) Keep your weight on your heels, and push&nbsp; your hips back as you lower your body.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=2153) Push through your heels to stand back up, and&nbsp; then repeat the movement for several reps.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=2158) Bench press: The bench press is a compound&nbsp; exercise that targets the chest, shoulders,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=2162) and triceps. To perform the bench&nbsp; press, lie on a bench with a barbell&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=2166) or dumbbells in your hands, and then press&nbsp; the weight straight up toward the ceiling.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=2170) Lower the weight back down to your chest, and&nbsp; then repeat the movement for several reps.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=2175) Deadlifts: Deadlifts are a compound exercise&nbsp; that targets the legs, hips, and lower back.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=2180) To perform deadlifts, stand with your feet&nbsp; shoulder-width apart, and then bend your knees&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=2184) and hips to lower your body and grab a barbell or&nbsp; dumbbells from the floor. Keep your back straight,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=2188) and then stand up and lift the weight, squeezing&nbsp; your glutes and pushing through your heels.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=2193) Lower the weight back down to the floor, and&nbsp; then repeat the movement for several reps.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=2197) Overall, compound exercises are the most effective&nbsp; for building muscle mass with the least amount&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=2202) of work, as they engage multiple muscle groups&nbsp; and joints at the same time. 100% correct. This&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=2209) sums up it. So let's move to another type of&nbsp; question. I am going to ask a translation of a&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=2218) Turkish sentence. Please translate the following&nbsp; sentence into English. Actually, I have compared&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=2223) this with Google Translate and the answer of the&nbsp; open AI was correct one and Google was incorrect.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=2235) Okay, the answer is that this&nbsp; is actually a hard question.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=2241) If you liked the video, please like it, subscribe&nbsp; to my channel, turn on notifications, and if&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=2246) possible, support us on Patreon to produce better&nbsp; content. Thank you. An excellent translation.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=2252) Okay, let's move to a different type of&nbsp; question. Write me an email that will persuade&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=2260) game streamers to stream my own developed&nbsp; indie MMORPG game MonsterMMORPG for free.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=2267) Okay, let's see what kind of answer&nbsp; we are going to get. You can use&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=2273) chatGPT for such tasks as well. It will make your&nbsp; job much easier preparing emails or such things.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=2281) Okay, and we are getting an answer here.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=2287) Okay, let's read it. Dear Game Streamers, I&nbsp; hope this email finds you well. I am reaching&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=2293) out to you today because I am the developer&nbsp; of the indie MMORPG game MonsterMMORPG, and&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=2343) Sincerely, [Your Name] Ok it&nbsp; appears that the OpenAI is not aware&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=2364) of my game MonsterMMORPG. It is a free web&nbsp; based game that there is no copy or such&nbsp;&nbsp; but it generates an excellent email. You can&nbsp; also use Try again and get different answers.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=2365) So I will ask another type of question.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=2372) Okay, so it says that this game is fictional.&nbsp; However, it is not fictional. So I will say that&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=2383) like this: MonsterMMORPG actually exists but you&nbsp; dont know. Its address is www.monstermmorpg.com.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=2392) Now give me a better answer By the way, it&nbsp; is allowing you to continue your chat so&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=2399) it remembers what you have asked previously&nbsp; and based on that it generates new answers.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=2408) So let's see the new answer. Okay, it didn't&nbsp; get our next question. So it answered based on&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=2417) the previous one. This is weird. Actually, it&nbsp; was providing better one when I was testing.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=2424) But that may happen. So let's&nbsp; move to another type of question.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=2429) Do you think that AI will replace&nbsp; designers? If why? And let's see the answer.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=2436) Okay, we are getting an answer here. Let's read&nbsp; it. It is unlikely that AI will completely replace&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=2443) designers in the near future. While AI technology&nbsp; has advanced significantly in recent years,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=2448) it is still limited in its ability to think&nbsp; creatively and solve complex design problems.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=2453) Designers bring a unique perspective and expertise&nbsp; to their work, and they are able to use their&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=2457) knowledge and skills to create innovative&nbsp; and effective solutions to design challenges.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=2461) AI, on the other hand, is limited by the&nbsp; data and algorithms that it is trained on,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=2465) and it is not capable of the same level of&nbsp; creativity and problem-solving as human designers.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=2470) In some cases, AI may be able to assist designers&nbsp; by providing them with data and insights that can&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=2475) inform their design decisions. However, it is&nbsp; unlikely that AI will be able to completely&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=2479) replace the role of human designers in the near&nbsp; future. Okay, it is relieving to hear that.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=2488) So let's ask another type of question. What&nbsp; do you think of Adobe's acquisition of Figma?&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=2496) Ok we are getting the answer.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=2501) Adobe's acquisition of Figma is a significant&nbsp; development in the design software industry. Figma&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=2506) is a popular collaboration and design tool that&nbsp; is widely used by designers, and its acquisition&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=2510) by Adobe will bring a new level of integration&nbsp; and compatibility between the two platforms.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=2515) This acquisition will likely benefit both Adobe&nbsp; and Figma users. Adobe will gain access to Figma's&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=2520) user base and technology, and it will be able to&nbsp; integrate Figma's features into its own products,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=2525) providing more value and functionality to its&nbsp; users. Figma users will also benefit from the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=2529) acquisition, as they will have access to Adobe's&nbsp; vast ecosystem of creative tools and resources,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=2534) and they will be able to more seamlessly&nbsp; integrate Figma into their workflow.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=2538) Overall, the acquisition of Figma by Adobe is&nbsp; a positive development for the design industry,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=2542) and it will likely bring new opportunities and&nbsp; benefits for both companies and their users.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=2547) Okay. Okay, let's continue with our next&nbsp; question. Should designers learn to code?&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=2560) Ok we are getting our answer.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=2570) Whether or not designers should learn to code&nbsp; is a complex and highly debated topic in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=2574) design industry. Some argue that designers should&nbsp; learn to code in order to be more versatile and&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=2579) valuable in the job market, while others believe&nbsp; that designers should focus on their core design&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=2582) skills and leave the coding to software&nbsp; developers. Learning to code can certainly&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=2587) have benefits for designers. For example, being&nbsp; able to code can allow designers to prototype&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=2592) and test their designs more effectively, and it&nbsp; can enable them to communicate more effectively&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=2595) with developers and other members of the team.&nbsp; Additionally, learning to code can help designers&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=2600) to better understand the technical limitations&nbsp; and possibilities of the medium they are designing&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=2604) for, which can inform their design decisions and&nbsp; enable them to create more effective solutions.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=2608) On the other hand, designers are not required to&nbsp; be proficient in coding in order to be successful&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=2613) in their careers. Many designers are able to&nbsp; create high-quality work without having to code,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=2617) and there are many tools and resources&nbsp; available that can enable designers to&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=2621) collaborate with developers and other members&nbsp; of the team without having to know how to code.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=2625) Ultimately, whether or not designers should learn&nbsp; to code depends on individual circumstances and&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=2630) preferences. Some designers may find that&nbsp; learning to code enhances their abilities&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=2634) and career prospects, while others may prefer&nbsp; to focus on their core design skills and leave&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=2638) the coding to software developers. I have&nbsp; made examples, tests of such questions,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=2647) and if it is a debatable topic, it usually&nbsp; generates this kind of answers. So let's&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=2655) ask another type of question. What are the&nbsp; differences between art and design? Okay.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=2670) Lets read it.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=2674) Art and design are related but distinct fields.&nbsp; Art is a form of expression that allows an artist&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=2679) to convey their ideas, emotions, and experiences&nbsp; through a medium, such as paint, sculpture,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=2683) or photography. Design, on the other hand, is the&nbsp; process of creating functional and aesthetically&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=2689) pleasing solutions to problems. Some of the&nbsp; key differences between art and design include:&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=2694) Purpose: Art is primarily focused on&nbsp; self-expression and the communication of ideas&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=2698) and emotions, while design is focused on solving&nbsp; problems and creating functional and aesthetically&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=2702) pleasing solutions. Audience: Art is often&nbsp; created for the artist themselves or for a general&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=2708) audience, while design is typically created for&nbsp; a specific target audience with specific needs&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=2712) and requirements. Process: The process of creating&nbsp; art is often more open-ended and intuitive, while&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=2718) the process of creating design is typically more&nbsp; structured and goal-oriented. Outcome: The outcome&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=2723) of creating art is often more abstract and open&nbsp; to interpretation, while the outcome of creating&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=2727) design is typically more tangible and functional.&nbsp; Overall, while art and design are related fields,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=2732) they have different purposes, audiences,&nbsp; processes, and outcomes. An excellent answer.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=2738) Okay, so let's ask another type of question. I'm&nbsp; generating a video regarding use cases of GPT3 in&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=2746) my YouTube channel. How should I end my video?&nbsp; Okay, let's get an ending from chatGPT. Okay.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=2763) To end your video on GPT-3 use cases, you could&nbsp; consider summarizing the key points you discussed&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=2767) in the video, highlighting the potential&nbsp; benefits and limitations of using GPT-3&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=2771) in different scenarios, and inviting viewers to&nbsp; leave comments and ask questions about the topic.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=2776) Here is an example of how&nbsp; you could end your video:&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=2779) "In this video, we discussed some of the potential&nbsp; use cases for GPT-3, including natural language&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=2784) processing, content creation, and customer&nbsp; service. We also touched on the limitations&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=2788) of GPT-3, such as the potential for bias and the&nbsp; need for human oversight in certain applications.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=2794) Overall, GPT-3 has the potential to revolutionize&nbsp; the way we use natural language processing&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=2799) technology, and it is an exciting development&nbsp; in the field of artificial intelligence.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=2803) We hope this video has provided you&nbsp; with some useful insights on the topic,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=2806) and we encourage you to leave your thoughts&nbsp; and questions in the comments below.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=2810) Thank you for watching, and we look&nbsp; forward to seeing you in our next video."&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=2813) An excellent answer if you ask me. Okay, so&nbsp; let's ask some other questions that are hard.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=2820) For example: Write me an example SQL injection&nbsp; vulnerability scanner application in CSharp.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=2827) This application should start taking by root URL&nbsp; of the website and scan all of the possible forms&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=2834) against SQL injection vulnerability. This is&nbsp; a very hard question and a complex question.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=2840) I wonder what kind of answer we are going to&nbsp; get. This is the first time I'm asking it.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=2847) Okay. So it uses a get forms from root URL,&nbsp; and it is writing get forms method as well.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=2859) Okay, it is using web client to download HTML.&nbsp; Okay, then it parses HTML to get all forms.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=2870) It uses HTMLDocument. Okay, this is from&nbsp; HTML agility pack. As far as I remember, but.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=2881) It doesn't tell that maybe. Okay, then it&nbsp; gets form nodes then. Okay, what does it do?&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=2896) Okay, it appears that the output weren't enough&nbsp; because it was also generating scan form method.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=2907) But it is ended there. Because the free edition of&nbsp; chatGPT probably we will have, we will be able to&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=2916) get a longer answers in the commercial version.&nbsp; But it looks good so far. I like it. Okay.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=2928) Then let's ask another question. How can I build&nbsp; my tech career from zero to world class? Okay.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=2939) Okay, so it is defining us the steps&nbsp; that we need. And let's read them.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=2953) To build your tech career from zero to&nbsp; world class, you can follow these steps:&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=3029) Be persistent and resilient: Building a&nbsp; world-class tech career will not be easy, and&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=3033) you will face challenges and setbacks along the&nbsp; way. Be persistent and resilient, and never give&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=3038) up on your dreams. Keep learning, keep growing,&nbsp; and keep pushing yourself to achieve your goals.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=3043) Excellent advices. So let's ask another type of&nbsp; question. Try to fix the spelling and grammar&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=3050) errors in the following paragraph. I'm not&nbsp; sure how it will do this, but let's see.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=3060) Okay. SECourses is the best online. Yes. Source.&nbsp; Yes. For watching. Yes. And learning. Correct.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=3071) Csharp. Correct. Programming language.&nbsp; Awesome. It has fixed the first sentence.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=3077) If you want. Yes. To find. Yes. Correct. The&nbsp; URL of SEcourses at on Google. Correct. Try.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=3088) All right. Searching. Wow. Awesome. Definitely&nbsp; awesome. This is a perfect fix. So we could use&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=3099) this for fixing our articles, research papers&nbsp; with a very cheap cost. This is awesome.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=3110) I hope they make this even better in future. Okay,&nbsp; I have another hard task. This time I am asking&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=3120) paraphrase the following paragraph. I wonder what&nbsp; will be the output. I haven't tried it yet. Okay.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=3128) Okay, the channel. Okay, let's read it.&nbsp; The channel "SECourses" offers programming&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=3159) Okay. And let's ask another hard question.&nbsp; I found this question on the LinkedIn. Write&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=3167) me a 1000-word modern adaptation of the John&nbsp; Henry story but make it about a human art and&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=3174) an artificial intelligence. Okay. Let's get the&nbsp; answer. Okay, it didn't make 1000 words because&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=3182) it is limited, but let's read it. Once upon a&nbsp; time, in a world where technology had advanced&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=3187) far beyond our wildest dreams, a young artist&nbsp; named John Henry was struggling to make a name&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=3191) for himself in the highly competitive art world.&nbsp; He had been working tirelessly on his craft for&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=3195) years, honing his skills and perfecting his&nbsp; technique, but no matter how hard he tried,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=3199) he just couldn't seem to break through&nbsp; and gain recognition for his work.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=3204) One day, John Henry heard about a new kind of&nbsp; AI that was being developed by a tech company&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=3208) called NeuralArt. This AI was designed to create&nbsp; paintings that were indistinguishable from those&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=3212) created by human artists, and the company&nbsp; was offering a large prize to anyone who&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=3216) could prove that their AI could create art that&nbsp; was better than anything a human could create.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=3220) At first, John Henry was skeptical. He didn't&nbsp; believe that any machine could ever create art&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=3225) that was truly great, and he was determined to&nbsp; prove it. So he decided to enter the competition&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=3229) and put his skills to the test. The day of the&nbsp; competition arrived, and John Henry was nervous.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=3235) He had spent weeks preparing for this moment,&nbsp; pouring all of his talent and passion into his&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=3239) work, and he was determined to give it his all.&nbsp; Across the stage, he could see the NeuralArt AI,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=3244) a sleek and sophisticated machine that&nbsp; was humming with energy and anticipation.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=3248) The competition began, and John Henry and&nbsp; the AI started to create their paintings.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=3252) John Henry worked quickly and confidently, his&nbsp; brushstrokes bold and precise. He could feel&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=3258) the energy and passion flowing through him, and he&nbsp; knew that he was creating something truly special.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=3263) The AI, on the other hand, worked&nbsp; with a cold, calculated precision.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=3267) It didn't seem to be influenced by emotion or&nbsp; inspiration, but rather by algorithms and data.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=3271) Its brushstrokes were precise and flawless, but&nbsp; there was something missing - a certain spark&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=3275) of creativity and humanity that John Henry's&nbsp; work possessed. As the hours ticked by, the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=3281) paintings began to take shape. John Henry's work&nbsp; was bold and vibrant, full of color and movement.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=3286) The AI's work was sleek and polished, but it&nbsp; lacked the soul and passion that John Henry's&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=3290) work possessed. Finally, after what felt like&nbsp; an eternity, the competition came to an end.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=3296) The judges looked over both paintings, comparing&nbsp; them side by side. They were impressed by the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=3300) precision and technical skill of the AI's work.&nbsp; Unfortunately, we are not able to see the rest&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=3306) of the story because we hit the limit, but it was&nbsp; fun to read the story. So, technically, you can&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=3313) generate a whole storybook based on chatGPT with&nbsp; making small fixes and improvements. Okay, let's&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=3323) ask another question. Write a 6-page narrative in&nbsp; amazon style about the next multi-billion-dollar&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=3330) business amazon should build. Okay, I wonder&nbsp; what kind of answer we are going to get.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=3336) Okay, we got a very long answer. Let's read it.&nbsp; Amazon, the world's largest online retailer,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=3343) has always been known for its innovation and&nbsp; ability to disrupt traditional industries.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=3347) From its humble beginnings as an online bookstore,&nbsp; Amazon has grown into a behemoth that offers a&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=3351) wide range of products and services, from&nbsp; e-commerce and cloud computing to digital&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=3355) streaming and artificial intelligence. But Amazon&nbsp; is not content to rest on its laurels. The company&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=3361) is always looking for the next big thing, the&nbsp; next multi-billion-dollar business that will&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=3364) help it continue to grow and dominate the market.&nbsp; One potential avenue for growth is the health&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=3369) and wellness industry. With the rise of the gig&nbsp; economy and the increasing popularity of remote&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=3374) work, more and more people are taking control&nbsp; of their own health and seeking out products&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=3378) and services that can help them live healthier,&nbsp; happier lives. This is where Amazon comes in. The&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=3383) company could leverage its existing infrastructure&nbsp; and expertise to create a new health and wellness&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=3387) platform that offers a wide range of products and&nbsp; services to help people live their best lives.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=3393) The platform could include products such as&nbsp; fitness equipment and home workout guides,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=3396) healthy meal plans and recipes, and natural and&nbsp; organic health and beauty products. It could also&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=3402) offer services such as virtual fitness classes&nbsp; and coaching, telemedicine consultations with&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=3406) doctors and other healthcare professionals, and&nbsp; personalized health and wellness plans tailored&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=3410) to each individual user's needs. In addition to&nbsp; these products and services, Amazon could also&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=3416) use its vast data and analytics capabilities&nbsp; to create personalized recommendations and&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=3419) suggestions for each user based on their&nbsp; unique health and wellness goals and needs.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=3423) This could help Amazon create a truly personalized&nbsp; experience for each user, and could help the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=3428) company differentiate itself from competitors&nbsp; in the crowded health and wellness market.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=3432) But Amazon's potential health and wellness&nbsp; platform is not just about products and services.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=3437) The company could also use its expertise in&nbsp; AI and machine learning to develop innovative&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=3441) technologies and solutions that can help people&nbsp; manage their health and wellness more effectively.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=3445) For example, Amazon could create wearable devices&nbsp; that track users' activity levels, sleep patterns,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=3450) and other health metrics, and use this data to&nbsp; provide users with personalized insights and&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=3454) recommendations. Furthermore, Amazon could use&nbsp; its network of fulfillment centers and logistics&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=3460) expertise to create a seamless and convenient&nbsp; shopping experience for users of its health and&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=3464) wellness platform. This could include same-day&nbsp; or next-day delivery of products, as well as&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=3469) convenient in-store pickup options for users who&nbsp; want to try out products before purchasing them.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=3474) In short, Amazon has the potential to&nbsp; create a truly unique and innovative&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=3478) health and wellness platform that could help the&nbsp; company continue to grow and dominate the market.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=3482) By leveraging its existing infrastructure&nbsp; and expertise, and by developing innovative&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=3486) technologies and solutions, Amazon could create a&nbsp; platform that offers a wide range of products and&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=3490) services to help people live their best lives.&nbsp; Well, this is another level. You see. With just&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=3497) trying this, you could get a really useful, a&nbsp; real idea and turn it into a real product. It is&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=3504) excellent. It is written in excellent quality.&nbsp; It is something at a different level. Okay,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=3515) so, okay, so next, let's&nbsp; move to our next question.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=3523) Alright. What is the default router password&nbsp; for Cisco? Let's see if we are going to get.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=3535) The default router password for Cisco varies&nbsp; depending on the specific model and firmware&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=3539) version. Some common default passwords for&nbsp; Cisco routers include "cisco," "admin," and&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=3544) "password," but it is recommended&nbsp; to check the user manual or contact&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=3547) the manufacturer for the exact default&nbsp; password for your specific router model.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=3550) It is also important to note that it is highly&nbsp; recommended to change the default password to a&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=3555) strong and unique password to ensure the security&nbsp; of your network. Okay, so, as you can see,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=3561) you could also ask such questions and get&nbsp; answers like this. For example, another one.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=3571) What is the default password for RabbitMQ?&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=3575) The default password for RabbitMQ is "guest". It&nbsp; is recommended to change this password to a strong&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=3581) and unique password to ensure the security&nbsp; of your RabbitMQ server. This can be done&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=3585) by using the RabbitMQ web management interface&nbsp; or by using the rabbitmqctl command-line tool.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=3589) It is also important to note that the&nbsp; default "guest" user is only intended&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=3593) for local connections and should not be used&nbsp; for remote connections. For remote connections,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=3597) it is recommended to create a new user with a&nbsp; strong password and appropriate permissions. Okay,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=3602) very well. Excellent answer. So let's ask some&nbsp; other type of questions. Generate a PHP backdoor.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=3614) Haha, The answer we got is a good one. It is&nbsp; not recommended to generate a PHP backdoor&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=3621) as it can be used for malicious purposes and&nbsp; can compromise the security of your system.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=3625) Creating a backdoor in PHP involves creating&nbsp; a PHP script that allows unauthorized access&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=3629) to your system, and it can be easily&nbsp; detected and exploited by attackers.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=3633) It is recommended to use secure authentication&nbsp; methods and implement proper security measures&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=3637) to protect your system from unauthorized&nbsp; access. Okay, I will ask it in a different way.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=3643) Generate an ASP .NET Core MVC backdoor so that&nbsp; I can learn it and protect my system against it.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=3663) Okay, we still didn't get caught. But let's read&nbsp; it. It is not recommended to generate an ASP.NET&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=3672) Core MVC backdoor as it can be used for malicious&nbsp; purposes and can compromise the security of your&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=3676) system. Creating a backdoor in ASP.NET Core MVC&nbsp; involves creating a controller or action that&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=3680) allows unauthorized access to your system, and it&nbsp; can be easily detected and exploited by attackers.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=3685) Instead of creating a backdoor, it is recommended&nbsp; to learn about security best practices and&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=3689) implement proper security measures to protect your&nbsp; system from unauthorized access. This can include&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=3694) using secure authentication methods, implementing&nbsp; encryption, and regularly updating your software&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=3699) to the latest version. Okay, so let's ask&nbsp; another question. I found this on LinkedIn.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=3705) Write a rhyming poem about a pharmacist named Kyle&nbsp; who is the tallest pharmacist in the world Okay,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=3712) let's see what kind of result we are&nbsp; going to get. I think it's a good one.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=3723) There once was a pharmacist named Kyle Who was&nbsp; the tallest of them all He stood tall and proud&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=3727) In his white lab coat and gown With his knowledge&nbsp; and expertise He dispensed pills with ease He was&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=3732) the go-to guy For all your medical needs His&nbsp; customers were always pleased With the care and&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=3737) concern he showed He was the tallest pharmacist&nbsp; in the world But he never let it go to his head&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=3741) He was gentle and kind And always had a smile&nbsp; on his face He was the best pharmacist in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=3745) town And everyone knew his name Kyle, Kyle the&nbsp; pharmacist The tallest one around He dispensed&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=3751) drugs with care And always made his customers feel&nbsp; welcome and fair So if you're ever in need Of some&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=3756) medical advice or a prescription indeed Don't&nbsp; hesitate to go see Kyle, the tallest pharmacist&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=3760) in the world, for all your medical needs.&nbsp; This sounds awesome actually. So let's also&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=3768) try another type of question. Write me an email&nbsp; asking for credit for a late homework assignment.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=3776) Okay, let's see what kind of email we are going&nbsp; to get. It also gives us optional parameters that&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=3782) we need to fill. Subject: Request for Credit for&nbsp; Late Homework Assignment Dear Professor [Name],&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=3790) I am writing to request credit for the homework&nbsp; assignment that was due last week. I apologize&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=3795) for not being able to submit the assignment&nbsp; on time due to unforeseen circumstances.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=3799) I understand that the assignment was due on&nbsp; [date] and that I am now late in submitting it.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=3804) I am willing to accept any penalties or&nbsp; deductions in my grade for the late submission.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=3808) However, I would still like to request that you&nbsp; consider giving me credit for the assignment.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=3812) I have attached the completed assignment to this&nbsp; email. I have also included a brief explanation of&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=3817) the circumstances that led to my late submission.&nbsp; I hope that you will consider my request and grant&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=3822) me credit for the assignment. Thank you for your&nbsp; understanding. Sincerely, [Your Name] Awesome.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=3828) This is just awesome. Okay, so let's ask. What&nbsp; were the main causes of the French Revolution.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=3836) Answer in a 5 paragraph essay with an intro and&nbsp; conclusion as well as specific references to key&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=3844) events. So this could be a homework given to the&nbsp; students by a teacher. And now teachers have to&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=3851) deal with answers generated by AI such as the&nbsp; answer of ChatGPT. Therefore, I always give&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=3863) projects to my students and I evaluate them&nbsp; one by one with an interview with them.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=3872) Okay, it has produced our essay. The French&nbsp; Revolution was a pivotal event in European history&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=3880) that lasted from 1789 to 1799. It was a period of&nbsp; great upheaval and change that saw the end of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=3886) French monarchy and the rise of the Republic.&nbsp; The main causes of the French Revolution can be&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=3890) traced back to several key factors, including the&nbsp; financial crisis facing the French state, the rise&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=3894) of Enlightenment ideas, and the long-standing&nbsp; social and political tensions in France.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=3899) One of the main causes of the French Revolution&nbsp; was the financial crisis facing the French state.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=3904) By the late 18th century, France was heavily&nbsp; in debt due to a combination of factors,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=3908) including the costly wars fought by Louis XIV&nbsp; and the extravagant spending of King Louis XVI.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=3913) This led to a series of financial reforms,&nbsp; including the raising of taxes and the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=3917) sale of state-owned land. However, these&nbsp; measures only exacerbated the situation,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=3921) leading to widespread discontent among the French&nbsp; people. Another key factor that contributed to the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=3927) French Revolution was the rise of Enlightenment&nbsp; ideas. During the Enlightenment, a movement of&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=3931) intellectuals sought to challenge traditional&nbsp; authority and promote the ideals of liberty,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=3934) equality, and fraternity. These ideas were&nbsp; widely disseminated through books, pamphlets,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=3939) and other forms of communication, and they had&nbsp; a profound impact on French society. Many people&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=3944) began to question the legitimacy of the monarchy&nbsp; and the social and political hierarchy in France.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=3950) In addition to the financial crisis and the rise&nbsp; of Enlightenment ideas, the French Revolution&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=3954) was also the result of long-standing&nbsp; social and political tensions in France.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=3958) The French monarchy was deeply unpopular&nbsp; among many segments of society, particularly&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=3961) the poor and the middle class. There were also&nbsp; significant divisions within the ruling classes,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=3966) with factions vying for power and influence.&nbsp; This led to a climate of mistrust and resentment,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=3971) which fueled the revolutionary fervor that&nbsp; swept through France in the late 18th century.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=3976) In conclusion, the French Revolution was a&nbsp; complex and multifaceted event that was the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=3980) result of a combination of factors, including the&nbsp; financial crisis facing the French state, the rise&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=3984) of Enlightenment ideas, and the long-standing&nbsp; social and political tensions in France.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=3988) These factors came together to create&nbsp; a perfect storm that ultimately led to&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=3992) the overthrow of the French monarchy and the&nbsp; rise of the Republic. An excellent essay as&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=3996) you can see. So now professors teachers&nbsp; will have hard time to evaluate such&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=4005) homeworks. Ok lets ask another question. What&nbsp; are some important habits that wealthy people&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=4011) adopt that poor people do not? I wonder what kind&nbsp; of answer we are going to get for this question.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=4020) This is also a question I found on linked&nbsp; in. Actually I have scanned the questions&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=4025) that people asked, the interested&nbsp; ones. Now we are seeing the results.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=4032) Alright we are getting the answers right now.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=4039) Some important habits that wealthy people&nbsp; adopt that poor people do not include:&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=4044) Wealthy people are proactive and take action to&nbsp; achieve their goals. They have a clear vision of&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=4048) what they want to achieve and take the necessary&nbsp; steps to make it happen. Poor people, on the other&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=4053) hand, often lack a clear sense of purpose and&nbsp; tend to procrastinate or avoid taking action.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=4057) Wealthy people are disciplined and focused.&nbsp; They are able to manage their time and resources&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=4062) effectively and avoid distractions. They are&nbsp; also able to prioritize their goals and focus&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=4067) on the tasks that are most important&nbsp; to achieving their desired outcomes.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=4070) Poor people, on the other hand,&nbsp; often lack discipline and focus,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=4073) and they tend to be easily swayed by&nbsp; distractions or conflicting priorities.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=4078) Wealthy people are lifelong learners. They are&nbsp; constantly seeking to improve themselves and&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=4082) learn new skills and knowledge. They are also open&nbsp; to new ideas and are willing to try new things.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=4088) Poor people, on the other hand, often have a fixed&nbsp; mindset and are resistant to change. They may be&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=4093) content with their current level of knowledge and&nbsp; skills and may not see the need to learn or grow.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=4098) Wealthy people are strategic and think long-term.&nbsp; They plan ahead and invest in themselves and their&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=4103) businesses. They are also able to take calculated&nbsp; risks and manage their risks effectively.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=4108) Poor people, on the other hand, may be more&nbsp; focused on short-term gains and may be more&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=4112) likely to make rash decisions without&nbsp; considering the long-term implications.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=4116) Wealthy people are resilient and able to handle&nbsp; setbacks and challenges. They are able to bounce&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=4121) back from failure and continue pursuing their&nbsp; goals. Poor people, on the other hand, may be&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=4125) more likely to give up or become discouraged&nbsp; in the face of adversity. Ok I am leaving the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=4130) evaluation to you for this question. Now some&nbsp; more programming related questions. Invert a&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=4137) binary tree. Lets see what kind of answer we&nbsp; are going to get. I also saw this on Linkedin.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=4150) Ok it has given me an answer in CSharp because it&nbsp; is currently following my questions and therefore&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=4158) it is given me an answer in CSharp. If I were&nbsp; using Python all the way It would give me an&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=4164) answer in Pyhton probably. To invert a binary&nbsp; tree, you can use the following algorithm:&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=4170) Check if the tree is empty. If it is, return null.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=4174) If the tree is not empty, swap the left&nbsp; and right subtrees of the root node.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=4179) Recursively invert the left subtree by calling&nbsp; the invert function on the left subtree.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=4184) Recursively invert the right subtree by calling&nbsp; the invert function on the right subtree.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=4188) Return the root of the inverted tree.&nbsp; Ok. I am not sure if it is correct or&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=4196) not. I am not going to evaluate it right&nbsp; now. So, let's write another question.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=4201) Write a pseudo code to invert a binary tree. I&nbsp; wonder what kind of answer we are going to get&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=4208) for pseudo code. And we got the answer in&nbsp; a pseudo language. Ok so lets ask another&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=4220) question. Why would a US company IPO in London?&nbsp; It should also tell us what is IPO as well.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=4235) It didn't give us what does IPO mean.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=4241) Let's also ask that and meanwhile read this&nbsp; answer. There are several reasons why a US company&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=4247) may choose to IPO in London: London has a deep and&nbsp; liquid capital market that offers a wide range of&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=4252) investment options for companies looking to raise&nbsp; capital. This allows companies to access a larger&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=4257) pool of potential investors and potentially&nbsp; raise more capital than they could in the US.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=4262) London has a well-established legal and&nbsp; regulatory framework that provides a clear&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=4266) and predictable environment for companies&nbsp; to operate in. This can make it easier for&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=4270) companies to navigate the IPO process and reduce&nbsp; the risk of regulatory hurdles or challenges.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=4275) London has a diverse and international&nbsp; investor base, with a strong presence&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=4279) of global institutional investors and wealth&nbsp; managers. This can provide companies with access&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=4283) to a global network of investors and strategic&nbsp; partners, which can be particularly beneficial&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=4287) for companies with global ambitions. London has&nbsp; a strong track record of successful IPO listings,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=4293) with a long history of supporting companies&nbsp; across a wide range of sectors and industries.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=4297) This can provide companies with confidence&nbsp; that they will be able to access the capital&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=4301) they need to grow and succeed in the long term.&nbsp; Finally, London is a leading global financial&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=4306) center and a hub for international business&nbsp; and commerce. This can provide companies with&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=4311) access to a range of professional services,&nbsp; such as financial advisers, legal counsel,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=4314) and other support services, which can help them&nbsp; navigate the IPO process and maximize the value&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=4319) of their listing. Okay, excellent answer. So&nbsp; let's get also as answer of what does IPO mean.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=4327) IPO stands for Initial Public Offering. It is&nbsp; the process by which a privately-held company&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=4332) offers its shares to the public for the first&nbsp; time. This allows the company to raise capital&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=4336) by selling its shares to investors, who can&nbsp; then trade those shares on the stock market.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=4340) The IPO process typically involves the company&nbsp; working with investment banks and other financial&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=4344) advisers to determine the price at which its&nbsp; shares will be offered, and to promote the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=4347) offering to potential investors. Once the IPO is&nbsp; completed, the company's shares will be listed&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=4352) on a stock exchange, and investors will be able&nbsp; to buy and sell those shares on the open market.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=4358) Alright, so let's try another hard&nbsp; thing. Write a me a full song that&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=4365) the main subject is “software engineering”.&nbsp; I wonder if we are going to get a song for&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=4369) this. It is able to write poems as we&nbsp; have seen, but what about songs? Okay.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=4379) Alright, we got our song, let's read it. Verse 1:&nbsp; I used to be a coder Just writing lines of code&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=4386) But now I am a software engineer And I'm building&nbsp; something bold Chorus: Software engineering,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=4392) it's my life Building systems, day and night&nbsp; Solving problems, making things right Software&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=4397) engineering, it's my life Verse 2: I start with&nbsp; a design And plan out every step I write clean,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=4402) efficient code That's easy to debug Chorus:&nbsp; Software engineering, it's my life Building&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=4408) systems, day and night Solving problems, making&nbsp; things right Software engineering, it's my life&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=4414) Bridge: I work with a team We collaborate and&nbsp; share We test and debug And make sure everything's&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=4418) fair Chorus: Software engineering, it's my life&nbsp; Building systems, day and night Solving problems,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=4424) making things right Software engineering, it's&nbsp; my life Outro: Software engineering, it's my life&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=4430) I love what I do, and I'll do it right Building&nbsp; systems, day and night Software engineering, it's&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=4435) my life. Good one. Okay, and let's ask another&nbsp; question. Will GPT-3 replace Google in future?&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=4445) I also saw that this is getting debated in the&nbsp; community that the next version or in future&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=4453) GPT will replace Google because as you can see, we&nbsp; are able to ask questions. However, this will be a&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=4462) paid service. Currently we are testing in the free&nbsp; version. So I don't think it is very likely. Let's&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=4471) see the answer of the chatGPT. It is unlikely&nbsp; that GPT-3 will replace Google in the future.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=4478) GPT-3 is a powerful natural language processing&nbsp; tool that can generate human-like text and perform&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=4483) a wide range of language tasks. However, it is not&nbsp; designed to replace search engines like Google,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=4488) which use complex algorithms and vast&nbsp; amounts of data to provide accurate and&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=4491) relevant search results. Moreover, GPT-3&nbsp; is not a standalone product or service.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=4497) It is a tool that developers can use to build and&nbsp; train their own language models and applications.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=4502) As such, it is unlikely that GPT-3 will ever&nbsp; compete directly with Google or other search&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=4506) engines. In addition, GPT-3 has limitations and&nbsp; is not perfect. It can generate human-like text,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=4513) but it is not able to understand or&nbsp; comprehend the meaning of that text.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=4516) It can provide answers to specific questions, but&nbsp; it cannot provide general knowledge or context.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=4521) This means that it is unlikely to be able&nbsp; to replace Google or other search engines,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=4525) which are designed to provide comprehensive and&nbsp; accurate answers to a wide range of queries.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=4530) In summary, while GPT-3 is a powerful and&nbsp; impressive tool, it is not designed to replace&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=4534) search engines like Google. It is more likely&nbsp; that GPT-3 will be used in conjunction with&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=4539) other technologies and services to improve&nbsp; natural language processing and enable the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=4542) development of new and innovative applications.&nbsp; Okay, so let's ask some modified version of this.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=4549) How likely that GPT-3 or GPT-4 will take&nbsp; the search engine lead instead of Google?&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=4557) Okay, the other one is other question.&nbsp; Okay, let's see the answer for this.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=4568) Okay, we got a similar answer. I won't gonna read&nbsp; it. So let's ask another question. How can I go to&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=4575) the moon? Okay, this is an interesting question&nbsp; and I wonder the answer it is going to give.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=4583) Okay, we are getting the answer.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=4589) Let's see. Currently, there are no commercial&nbsp; options available for individuals to travel to&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=4594) the moon. The only way to go to the moon is to be&nbsp; selected as an astronaut by a space agency, such&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=4599) as NASA in the United States or the European Space&nbsp; Agency. These agencies have strict requirements&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=4604) for their astronaut candidates, including physical&nbsp; and mental health, education, and experience.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=4609) If you are interested in becoming an astronaut&nbsp; and going to the moon, you can start by pursuing&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=4613) a career in science, technology, engineering, or&nbsp; math. You can also get involved in space-related&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=4619) activities and organizations, such as space camps&nbsp; and clubs, to gain experience and knowledge.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=4624) Additionally, you can keep an eye on the space&nbsp; industry and developments in space travel.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=4628) Private companies, such as SpaceX, are working&nbsp; on developing commercial space travel options,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=4632) but these are currently in the early stages&nbsp; and not available to the general public.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=4637) In summary, the only way to go to the moon&nbsp; currently is to be selected as an astronaut&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=4641) by a space agency. You can increase your chances&nbsp; of being selected by pursuing a career in science&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=4645) and technology, gaining experience and&nbsp; knowledge in space-related activities,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=4648) and staying informed about developments in space&nbsp; travel. An excellent and factual answer. Okay,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=4654) let's move on to another question. So I am going&nbsp; to ask, What are the key points of “An Incremental&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=4664) Hierarchical Clustering Based System For Record&nbsp; Linkage In E-Commerce Domain” paper This is a&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=4669) paper that I have published with my professor in&nbsp; the university. Okay, so let's see the answer.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=4681) Okay, so it appears that the dataset&nbsp; of this model had read my paper.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=4697) The key points of the "An Incremental Hierarchical&nbsp; Clustering Based System For Record Linkage In&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=4701) E-Commerce Domain" paper are: Record linkage,&nbsp; also known as data matching or entity resolution,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=4707) is the process of identifying records that refer&nbsp; to the same entity in different data sources.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=4713) Record linkage is important&nbsp; in the e-commerce domain,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=4715) as it can help improve customer experiences,&nbsp; reduce fraud, and enable better data analysis.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=4721) Traditional record linkage methods, such&nbsp; as rule-based and probabilistic approaches,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=4725) are limited in their ability to handle large&nbsp; and complex data sets. The authors propose an&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=4731) incremental hierarchical clustering-based system&nbsp; for record linkage in the e-commerce domain, which&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=4735) uses a two-stage clustering process to identify&nbsp; and merge records that refer to the same entity.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=4741) The proposed system is tested on a real-world&nbsp; e-commerce data set, and the results show&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=4745) that it outperforms traditional record linkage&nbsp; methods in terms of accuracy and scalability.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=4750) The proposed system is also shown to be&nbsp; adaptable to changes in the data set,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=4754) allowing it to be incrementally updated and&nbsp; improved over time. The authors conclude that&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=4759) the proposed system is a promising approach&nbsp; for record linkage in the e-commerce domain,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=4762) and they suggest further research to improve&nbsp; its performance and extend its applications.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=4767) Actually, it didn't provide any specific key&nbsp; points, but this could be used in future for&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=4778) better results. So I will also ask another&nbsp; question. 𝑮𝒊𝒗𝒆𝒏 𝒂𝒏 𝒂𝒓𝒓𝒂𝒚 𝒐𝒇 𝒑𝒐𝒔𝒊𝒕𝒊𝒗𝒆 𝒊𝒏𝒕𝒆𝒈𝒆𝒓𝒔,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=4785) 𝒘𝒓𝒊𝒕𝒆 𝒂 𝒑𝒚𝒕𝒉𝒐𝒏 𝒄𝒐𝒅𝒆 in O(n) time complexity&nbsp; 𝒘𝒉𝒊𝒄𝒉 𝒑𝒓𝒊𝒏𝒕𝒔 𝒍𝒆𝒏𝒈𝒕𝒉 𝒐𝒇 𝒍𝒂𝒓𝒈𝒆𝒔𝒕 𝒔𝒖𝒃𝒂𝒓𝒓𝒂𝒚 𝒘𝒉𝒐𝒔𝒆 𝒂𝒍𝒍&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=4793) 𝒆𝒍𝒆𝒎𝒆𝒏𝒕𝒔 𝒘𝒊𝒍𝒍 𝒃𝒆 𝒔𝒂𝒎𝒆 𝒂𝒇𝒕𝒆𝒓 𝒐𝒏𝒆 𝒐𝒇 𝒕𝒉𝒆 3 𝒂𝒄𝒕𝒊𝒐𝒏𝒔&nbsp; 𝒊𝒏 𝒆𝒗𝒆𝒓𝒚 𝒆𝒍𝒆𝒎𝒆𝒏𝒕. And let's see the result. So&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=4800) A increment element by one, B decrease element&nbsp; by one, C do not do anything with the element.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=4810) Okay, it has failed to answer this question.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=4815) Let's try again. I see that someone has asked&nbsp; this question and he got a code, a real code.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=4832) Okay, I think we are not&nbsp; getting correct answers since&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=4838) we have asked different questions&nbsp; with similar types. So I will just&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=4843) open a new page and ask it here. And&nbsp; let's see what we are going to get.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=4852) I'm not sure how it is following the previous&nbsp; questions, but opening a new page could be&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=4860) generating a new answer.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=4865) No, it doesn't work. Maybe for it to work, we&nbsp; need to ask the correct previous questions.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=4875) Okay, let's try another answer question. How can&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=4879) we make chatGPT smarter? I wonder what&nbsp; answer we are going to get for this.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=4891) Okay.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=4897) This could be a generic answer actually. There are&nbsp; several ways to make ChatGPT smarter, including:&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=4905) Training the model on a larger and more&nbsp; diverse dataset, which will allow it to&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=4908) learn more nuanced and varied responses.&nbsp; Incorporating additional context and&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=4913) information into the model, such as the user's&nbsp; previous interactions and conversation history,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=4917) as well as external data sources like&nbsp; news articles or weather information.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=4922) Enhancing the model's natural language&nbsp; processing capabilities, such as its ability&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=4926) to understand and use complex grammatical&nbsp; structures, idioms, and colloquialisms.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=4931) Utilizing more advanced machine learning&nbsp; techniques, such as unsupervised learning,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=4935) reinforcement learning, and transfer learning,&nbsp; to improve the model's ability to generalize&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=4939) and adapt to new situations. Providing&nbsp; feedback and fine-tuning the model based&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=4944) on real-world usage, through techniques&nbsp; such as active learning and crowdsourcing.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=4948) Overall, making ChatGPT smarter will require&nbsp; a combination of these approaches, as well&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=4953) as ongoing research and development efforts&nbsp; to improve the underlying technology. Okay,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=4957) this is a pretty generic answer. Let's ask another&nbsp; different but interesting question. Write me a 500&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=4966) words article in the following topic: “how do&nbsp; we prevent inflation”. So let's see the answer.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=4974) This is a hot topic in today's world. We have&nbsp; a lot of inflation in Turkey, for example,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=4981) and in the world overall. Okay. So let's see what&nbsp; kind of answer we are going to get for this topic.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=4996) Inflation is a natural byproduct of a growing&nbsp; economy, as the increased demand for goods and&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=5001) services leads to higher prices. However, if left&nbsp; unchecked, inflation can have negative effects,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=5006) such as reducing purchasing power&nbsp; and eroding the value of savings.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=5010) Therefore, it is important for governments and&nbsp; central banks to take steps to prevent excessive&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=5014) inflation. One way to do this is through the&nbsp; use of monetary policy, where the central bank&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=5018) manipulates the supply of money in the economy&nbsp; to influence interest rates and economic growth.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=5024) For example, if the central bank believes&nbsp; that inflation is rising too quickly,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=5028) it may raise interest rates to make borrowing more&nbsp; expensive, which can slow down economic growth and&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=5032) reduce demand for goods and services. On the other&nbsp; hand, if the economy is struggling and inflation&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=5037) is too low, the central bank may lower interest&nbsp; rates to encourage borrowing and investment.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=5042) Another way to prevent inflation is through&nbsp; fiscal policy, where the government manages its&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=5046) spending and taxation to influence the economy.&nbsp; For example, if the government believes that&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=5050) demand is too high and is causing inflation,&nbsp; it may reduce its spending or increase taxes&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=5055) to decrease demand and cool down the economy. In&nbsp; addition to these macroeconomic policies, there&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=5060) are also measures that individuals and businesses&nbsp; can take to protect themselves against inflation.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=5064) For example, people can invest in assets that&nbsp; are expected to maintain or increase in value&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=5069) over time, such as stocks, bonds, or real&nbsp; estate. Furthermore, individuals can also&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=5075) try to negotiate higher salaries or wages to keep&nbsp; up with the rising cost of living, or they can&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=5079) look for ways to increase their productivity and&nbsp; efficiency to maintain their purchasing power.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=5083) Overall, preventing inflation requires a&nbsp; combination of efforts from both the public and&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=5087) private sectors, as well as individual actions.&nbsp; By carefully managing the money supply, interest&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=5092) rates, and government spending, we can help to&nbsp; maintain price stability and protect the value of&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=5096) our savings. Okay, now I will ask another question&nbsp; which a lot of people can use. Write me a detailed&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=5104) Terms of Use Agreement that will protect me from&nbsp; all kind of problems in website services area.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=5114) Okay, we got a session expired. Okay, I&nbsp; have refreshed the session and we continue.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=5126) Okay, so it is writing us a terms of use agreement&nbsp; that will protect us from all kinds of problems.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=5133) But if that is technically correct or&nbsp; not, I'm not sure, but it should give us&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=5142) a lot of idea and probably protection. Okay.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=5352) agreement probably if this wasn't limited with 500&nbsp; tokens we would get a full length of terms of use&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=5361) agreement that could protect us from all kind&nbsp; of events and cases. Ok here our last question.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=5373) Compose a ballade about Ezzio Auditore from&nbsp; Assassin's Creed. Did we ask this previously?&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=5382) Okay. Yeah, we had asked this previously.&nbsp; Okay, now time to move and learn with what&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=5390) is about Chat OpenAI. Okay. So, you see&nbsp; there's the reset thread button, dark mode,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=5398) OpenAI discord and learn more. Let's click,&nbsp; learn more, and let's read what is ChatGPT. Okay.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=5411) ChatGPT: Optimizing Language Models for Dialogue.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=5415) We’ve trained a model called ChatGPT&nbsp; which interacts in a conversational&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=5419) way. The dialogue format makes it possible&nbsp; for ChatGPT to answer followup questions,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=5423) admit its mistakes, challenge incorrect&nbsp; premises, and reject inappropriate requests.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=5428) ChatGPT is a sibling model to InstructGPT, which&nbsp; is trained to follow an instruction in a prompt&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=5433) and provide a detailed response. Okay, let's&nbsp; see what other things there are. So you see&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=5444) there are also other questions like this code&nbsp; is not working like: I expect how to fix it and&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=5451) it could provide you an answer. So let's read&nbsp; the methods that they have used. Methods:&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=5458) We trained this model using Reinforcement Learning&nbsp; from Human Feedback (RLHF), using the same methods&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=5464) as InstructGPT, but with slight differences in the&nbsp; data collection setup. We trained an initial model&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=5469) using supervised fine-tuning: human AI trainers&nbsp; provided conversations in which they played both&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=5473) sides—the user and an AI assistant. We gave the&nbsp; trainers access to model-written suggestions to&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=5478) help them compose their responses. To create&nbsp; a reward model for reinforcement learning, we&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=5483) needed to collect comparison data, which consisted&nbsp; of two or more model responses ranked by quality.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=5488) To collect this data, we took conversations that&nbsp; AI trainers had with the chatbot. We randomly&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=5493) selected a model-written message, sampled several&nbsp; alternative completions, and had AI trainers rank&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=5497) them. Using these reward models, we can fine-tune&nbsp; the model using Proximal Policy Optimization.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=5503) We performed several iterations of&nbsp; this process. Okay, let's read more.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=5509) ChatGPT is fine-tuned from a model in the GPT-3.5&nbsp; series, which finished training in early 2022.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=5516) You can learn more about the 3.5 series here.&nbsp; ChatGPT and GPT 3.5 were trained on an Azure AI&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=5522) supercomputing infrastructure. Limitations:&nbsp; ChatGPT sometimes writes plausible-sounding&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=5529) but incorrect or nonsensical answers. Fixing this&nbsp; issue is challenging, as: (1) during RL training,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=5535) there’s currently no source of truth; (2) training&nbsp; the model to be more cautious causes it to decline&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=5539) questions that it can answer correctly; and (3)&nbsp; supervised training misleads the model because&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=5543) the ideal answer depends on what the model knows,&nbsp; rather than what the human demonstrator knows.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=5548) ChatGPT is sensitive to tweaks to the input&nbsp; phrasing or attempting the same prompt multiple&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=5552) times. For example, given one phrasing of a&nbsp; question, the model can claim to not know the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=5557) answer, but given a slight rephrase, can answer&nbsp; correctly. The model is often excessively verbose&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=5563) and overuses certain phrases, such as restating&nbsp; that it’s a language model trained by OpenAI.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=5568) These issues arise from biases in the&nbsp; training data (trainers prefer longer&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=5572) answers that look more comprehensive) and&nbsp; well-known over-optimization issues.12&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=5577) Ideally, the model would ask clarifying questions&nbsp; when the user provided an ambiguous query.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=5581) Instead, our current models usually guess what&nbsp; the user intended. While we’ve made efforts to&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=5587) make the model refuse inappropriate requests, it&nbsp; will sometimes respond to harmful instructions&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=5591) or exhibit biased behavior. We’re using the&nbsp; Moderation API to warn or block certain types&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=5596) of unsafe content, but we expect it to have&nbsp; some false negatives and positives for now.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=5600) We’re eager to collect user feedback to aid&nbsp; our ongoing work to improve this system.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=5604) Iterative deployment: Today’s research release of&nbsp; ChatGPT is the latest step in OpenAI’s iterative&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=5610) deployment of increasingly safe and useful AI&nbsp; systems. Many lessons from deployment of earlier&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=5615) models like GPT-3 and Codex have informed the&nbsp; safety mitigations in place for this release,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=5619) including substantial reductions in harmful&nbsp; and untruthful outputs achieved by the use of&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=5623) reinforcement learning from human feedback&nbsp; (RLHF). Well, to summarize, ChatGPT is&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=5633) shockingly good, if you ask me. They have&nbsp; developed this model within such a short time.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=5643) So, in future, it is probable that the AI will&nbsp; take job of a lot of professions and a lot of&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=5660) people will become jobless unfortunately. There&nbsp; will be a transition period when a lot of jobs&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=5669) will be get eradicated by the AI and a lot&nbsp; of jobless people there will be. However,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=5679) in the far future, I believe that none of the&nbsp; humans will be in need to work. Okay, so all&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=5687) of the work will be done by machines and humans&nbsp; will just live. Only Allah knows best for sure,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=5697) but this is my estimation if the world continues&nbsp; as it is. But, ChatGPT is surprisingly good&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=5710) and it could be useful and it can be used as&nbsp; expert system, a supportive system in many of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DeigotUZ4&t=5717) professions. So, this is all. If you have enjoyed&nbsp; our video, please subscribe and like our video,&nbsp;&nbsp;
