Preparation of this tutorial took more than 1 week and this will be the very best and easiest to follow tutorial since it is made with famous #SwarmUI. SwarmUI is as easy and as advanced as Automatic1111 SD Web UI. Biggest advantage of SwarmUI is that, it uses ComfyUI as a back-end. Therefore, It is extremely fast, VRAM optimized and supports all of the newest SOTA models as soon as they are published.

So in this tutorial I will show you how to setup SwarmUI and FLUX Dev tools on your Windows Computer, Massed Compute, RunPod and Kaggle. I will step by step explanatin and show you every tips and tricks that you need to properly do style transfer, re-imagine, inpaint, outpaint, depth and canny with FLUX.

### Video Transcription


- [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=0) Greetings everyone. Today I am going to show you&nbsp; how to use the newest FLUX models on SwarmUI very&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=5) easily with the maximum performance and&nbsp; the quality and the best configurations.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=11) I will begin with showing the FLUX Redux model,&nbsp; re-imagine input images like this case. Moreover,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=18) I will show you how to combine multiple images&nbsp; with FLUX Redux model and re-imagine them like&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=25) this case. Input images are 3 images and this is&nbsp; the output of combining 3 images with the FLUX&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=30) Redux model. Furthermore, I will show you how to&nbsp; convert any image into a Canny map, then use the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=36) FLUX Canny model and generate new images from the&nbsp; input images like this one. This is an amazing&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=42) image. Moreover, I will show you how to convert&nbsp; any input image into the depth map then use the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=49) FLUX Depth model and generate new images based&nbsp; on the depth of that input image. Furthermore,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=55) I will show you how to do in-painting properly&nbsp; and in-paint any part of any image with such an&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=62) amazing quality that you have never seen before&nbsp; with the inpainting inpainting model of the FLUX&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=67) Tools. And finally, I will show you how to do&nbsp; outpainting properly. This was something that&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=73) I have been waiting for. The outpainting quality&nbsp; of the FLUX Dev is non-challenged. There is no&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=80) other even paid services to outpaint like&nbsp; this one. And this is all running locally&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=86) on your computer. What if you are a GPU poor,&nbsp; if you don't have a powerful GPU? Don't worry,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=92) I will show you how to install and set&nbsp; up SwarmUI with FLUX Tools on RunPod,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=97) on Massed Compute, which is my favorite platform&nbsp; with amazing price and amazing speed. And finally,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=105) I will show you how to use SwarmUI and FLUX Tools&nbsp; on a free Kaggle account. If you don't want to pay&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=112) to the RunPod or Massed Compute, Kaggle is way&nbsp; to go. This tutorial will be a public tutorial,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=118) you will be able to learn how to use FLUX&nbsp; Tools totally free without any paid content,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=123) without any paywall. And I will also show how to&nbsp; generate grids to find the best hyperparameters&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=130) for your cases. I already have prepared some best&nbsp; hyperparameters. But when you learn how to use the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=136) grid system of the SwarmUI, you will get even&nbsp; better images. So as usual, I have prepared an&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=143) amazing public post. This post is 100% public.&nbsp; You don't even need to login into the Patreon,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=151) register into Patreon to see this post. As I&nbsp; promised, this is going to be a fully public&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=156) tutorial. I have updated my SwarmUI playlist.&nbsp; So click this link. And if you are new to the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=164) SwarmUI, you can watch them from beginning to the&nbsp; end. This is the oldest one. This is the newest&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=170) one. And each one of them is a public tutorial.&nbsp; Since there weren't any changes. For installation&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=177) and setup of the SwarmUI, I recommend you to&nbsp; watch these tutorials. Because I am going to&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=183) make this one, the one you are watching right now,&nbsp; shorter than the other ones at the installation&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=190) part. They are also individually linked here. So&nbsp; I will quickly begin with installation and update&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=198) if you already have SwarmUI. The files that you&nbsp; need are located in the attachments. Moreover,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=206) I will show how to use the FLUX tools, how&nbsp; to download models and install on RunPod and&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=212) Massed Compute as well. However, I am not going&nbsp; to show how to use at that part of the tutorial.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=219) So to learn how to use FLUX tools, you need to&nbsp; watch this part. This Windows usage part. Then&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=226) you can look at the Massed Compute and RunPod part&nbsp; to how to install them. So the Windows installer&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=234) is here. You see Windows Installer bat file.&nbsp; Remember, to be able to use SwarmUI on Windows,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=240) you need to have .NET 8 from here installed. So I&nbsp; am going to install into R drive into swarm_tools&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=248) folder. Double click. More info run anyway.&nbsp; It will automatically start the installation.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=253) This is same as other tutorials so it will&nbsp; be fast. I agree. Customize settings. Modern&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=259) dark. Just yourself on this PC. ComfyUI local.&nbsp; I am not going to download anything. Next. Yes,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=266) I am sure. Install now. So the installation is&nbsp; getting completed. In the logs you can always see&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=272) what it is doing. It is installing the necessary&nbsp; libraries in the initial install. And there is one&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=279) very important thing. In the backends. In the&nbsp; ComfyUI. It is automatically added here. You&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=285) should have always update to have always updated&nbsp; ComfyUI backend. Because I am getting a lot of&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=293) complaints that the newest models are not working&nbsp; because their ComfyUI back-end is not updated. So&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=299) when this option is selected it is going to update&nbsp; the ComfyUI backend to the latest version whenever&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=306) you restart your SwarmUI. So the installation has&nbsp; been completed. Now I will show how to update your&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=312) existing SwarmUI installation before beginning&nbsp; this tutorial. It is inside here. Enter inside&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=319) the SwarmUI installed folder and double-click&nbsp; start the windows update.bat file. It will update&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=325) the SwarmUI to the latest version. Moreover, if&nbsp; your ComfyUI is not automatically updated for any&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=332) reason, in the ComfyUI update folder you will see&nbsp; ComfyUI update.bat file. Double-click it. It will&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=339) update it to the latest version. Now the SwarmUI&nbsp; is ready. To use the FLUX Tools, what you need?&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=346) You need to download the FLUX Tools models. 28&nbsp; November update. Which files you need? Whichever&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=353) you want to use. But I recommend to download all&nbsp; of them and test all of them. So the FLUX.1 Redux&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=360) dev file goes into this folder. The other one goes&nbsp; into this and this one goes into this. However,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=366) I recommend to use SwarmUI unified downloader&nbsp; which I am going to use. So click here. I am&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=372) keeping this downloader very up to date and I am&nbsp; adding the models as you request them. Go to the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=379) bottom attachments. Download the latest zip file.&nbsp; Move that zip file into the parent folder of your&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=387) SwarmUI folder like this. Right-click and extract&nbsp; all. I am going to extract. So you see they are&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=393) extracted into a new folder. So right-click and&nbsp; cut them. Move them into here. This folder. Then&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=400) you are ready. So double-click Windows download&nbsp; models.bat file. More info run anyway. It will&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=407) list you all of the possible options. So for this&nbsp; tutorial what I am going to do is. I am going to&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=413) use FP16. It will be automatically casted into FP8&nbsp; when I am using because my GPU is not sufficient.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=419) So option 1 comma. However if you have RAM limited&nbsp; you should download the FP8 FLUX dev model. The&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=427) scaled may not work with the newest FLUX tools.&nbsp; So you should download option 10 if you don't have&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=435) 64 GB of RAM memory. Then I am going to download&nbsp; FP8 version of the T5. This is scaled version as&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=442) you are seeing. Option 6. Then I am going to&nbsp; download the newest FLUX tools. They are all&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=449) here as you are seeing. Option 13, 14, 15, 16, 17,&nbsp; and 18. You can also download the automatic face&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=459) inpainting yolo model which is here. Option 11.&nbsp; And we are ready. Then hit enter and it will start&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=466) downloading all of the models with the maximum&nbsp; possible speed of your internet connection. I&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=473) have optimized the installer for this task. You&nbsp; see it is downloading with over 150 megabytes&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=479) per second. This is on my personal computer. If&nbsp; you are installing on the cloud services it is&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=485) even over 1000 megabytes per second. So it depends&nbsp; on your internet speed and your hard drive speed.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=492) But this will download with the maximum possible&nbsp; speed. It is not like downloading from your&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=498) browser. This will be way faster way way faster.&nbsp; Okay. So all of the models have been downloaded&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=505) under 20 minutes. Folder verified. Downloads&nbsp; have been completed. Now we are ready to start&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=512) using the FLUX tools with the SwarmUI locally on&nbsp; our Windows computer. So close this. Go back to&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=519) your SwarmUI installation. This is the folder and&nbsp; to launch the SwarmUI we are going to use launch&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=525) windows.bat file as usual. It is going to start&nbsp; the SwarmUI. So we are both updated to the latest&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=533) version of SwarmUI and the ComfyUI backend. And&nbsp; we have downloaded the FLUX tool models and the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=540) FLUX dev model. I'm also hopefully going to add&nbsp; FP8 version of these FLUX tools when they become&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=547) available. FP8 version is especially important for&nbsp; low RAM users. Because otherwise it will load into&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=556) RAM memory and then it will cast it into the FP8&nbsp; and it will take time if you don't have a high RAM&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=563) memory. So I'm going to begin with showing you how&nbsp; to use the FLUX Redux models. As I have shown, I&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=572) have made a lot of a lot of research over 3 days,&nbsp; hundreds, thousands of images. So I have prepared&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=580) best working configurations. They are inside the&nbsp; SwarmUI unified downloader. You see best working&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=587) configurations. If you don't want to watch this&nbsp; tutorial you can just look at this&nbsp;file to see&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=593) the best configurations. So I'm going to use this&nbsp; image to generate similar images as a beginning.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=599) How are you going to use the FLUX redux model?&nbsp; Drag and drop the image into the prompt bar here.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=606) So you see, I have dragged and dropped the image&nbsp; that I want to use as a base into the prompt bar&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=613) like this. Not init image or anything else. CFG&nbsp; scale is 1. The sampling I let them default. It&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=620) works best. However, I find that FLUX guidance&nbsp; scale 6 is working best. This is what I recommend.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=628) And turn off the init image. We are not using&nbsp; it. Control let everything is turned off. In&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=634) the advanced sampling, since I have lower VRAM,&nbsp; I am going to make the precision as FP8. So it&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=643) is going to convert the base model into the FP8 on&nbsp; my GPU, but if you are using it on a high VRAM GPU&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=651) like 48GB I recommend FP16. And after I did load&nbsp; image into here as a prompt, you will see that&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=659) a new screen appeared. Image prompting. You&nbsp; see it is enabled. So in here we are going to&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=665) select FLUX.1 Redux dev.safetensor file. This&nbsp; is super important. Base model is FLUX dev and&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=672) this is the style model. Now which style model&nbsp; merge strength you need? I find that 0.4, 0.5,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=682) and 0.6 are the best ones. I cannot say which one&nbsp; will work best. So I recommend to test all three&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=689) of them. I usually find that 0.6 is working best.&nbsp; But you need to compare. Model apply start. This&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=697) is super important. Since it is percentage&nbsp; based but it only can works with integers&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=702) because it is depending on the steps count. You&nbsp; need to calculate which step you want to start.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=708) If you want to start with the step 1 then you&nbsp; can enter something like this. It will start&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=713) with the step 1. If you want to start with the&nbsp; step 2 and if you are doing 40 steps then it is&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=719) 2 over 40. So it is this value. If you set this&nbsp; model apply start at this, it is going to start&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=727) at the step 2. However I find that starting model&nbsp; start at 0 is working better. So it is up to you.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=733) You can compare it. Like enter 0.01. It will start&nbsp; at the step 1. If you enter 0.05 it will start at&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=742) the step 2 according to the number of steps&nbsp; you are doing. But I find that 0 is better.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=749) And finally we need to define our prompt.&nbsp; What we want to generate similar image to&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=755) this. I am going to generate a dragon bird.&nbsp; Something like this. And the seed is random.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=762) Let's generate the first image. So if you want to&nbsp; follow what is happening. Go to the server. Go to&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=768) the logs. Go to the debug from view. And you&nbsp; will see what is happening. It is downloading&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=773) the clip vision automatically since this is&nbsp; first time running on a fresh installation.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=779) It started the generation. I have RTX 3090 and it&nbsp; was 1.6 seconds per it. If you have RTX 4090 it&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=788) would be like 3 times faster. So this is the image&nbsp; generated. I think it is looking pretty pretty&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=796) amazing. So as I said. To be sure which style&nbsp; model merge strength is best. You can use this.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=803) It is so easy. Go to the tools. Grid Generator.&nbsp; And enter here: Style Model Merge Strength. So&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=811) try 0.4, 0.5, 0.6. And generate a grid. You can&nbsp; also give a name. Like test1. And generate grid.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=820) OK. So the grid generation has been completed.&nbsp; Click here to open it also from loadgrid config.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=826) You can select Load grid config and open. Let's&nbsp; open. So the grid is here. The first one is 0.4.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=834) This is the generation. 0.5. And 0.6. So you can&nbsp; compare. You can pick the best one. In this case,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=842) I think the best working one is 0.5. Because I&nbsp; see some errors in the other two. Like here. Or&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=851) here. So I like the 0.5 best. But it is up to you.&nbsp; Whatever you want. And also I have entered a very&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=859) very basic prompt. Second usage case of the Redux&nbsp; is combining multiple images. So I am opening a&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=868) new tab. And I am going to combine three images.&nbsp; So the first image will be this one. This is an&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=874) image that I have generated with my trained model.&nbsp; So I am going to combine this image with a style&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=881) image. Move it here. Then. I am going to move the&nbsp; style image which is this one. However to keep the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=889) face consistency. I am going to use the trained&nbsp; model as a base model. Which is here. This one.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=897) And if you wonder how you can train yourself&nbsp; with such quality. This is the tutorial that&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=903) you need to watch. Watch this tutorial. And you&nbsp; will be amazingly train yourself and generate&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=910) amazing quality images as that one. So what else&nbsp; I need. When combining styles you need to prompt&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=917) them accordingly. So this is a real image. A&nbsp; person. And this is an anime style image. So&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=924) this is the anime style image that I am going to&nbsp; use. Therefore I am going to say anime ohwx man&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=931) in a jungle. Then I am going to inpaint the face.&nbsp; For inpainting face I am going to use YOLO model.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=939) Segment YOLO. And the model that I am going to use&nbsp; is man face. The values is like 0.6, 0.5. So the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=950) 0.6 is how much denoise I want to have. And I am&nbsp; going to say anime ohwx man. The image prompting&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=958) is ready. It is selected. Let's make the strength&nbsp; as 0.5. Everything else is same as before. And now&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=966) we are ready to generate. So hit generate and just&nbsp; wait. Okay. The image has been generated. However,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=973) you see that I have changed the YOLO face&nbsp; segmentation model because the other one&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=981) gave an error. I have reported that. So I have&nbsp; used the classic after detailer trained YOLO face&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=990) model. This face model information exists in the&nbsp; main post that I have shown you in the beginning.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=998) So here the image that has been generated. If the&nbsp; resemblance is not that great. You can modify your&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=1005) prompt. You can generate more images. Or you can&nbsp; even use the variation seed and set it like 0.05.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=1014) So it is going to change the image only 5%. So&nbsp; you know the drill. You need to generate more&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=1020) images to get the perfect accuracy. It is still&nbsp; very decent. However, it can be way better if I&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=1026) want and if I generate more images. So what about&nbsp; merging 3 images at once? The logic is totally&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=1036) same. All you need to do is adding the third&nbsp; image. You see. Now I can merge 3 images. You&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=1043) don't even need to change the prompt. But you&nbsp; can also change the prompt. So let's make the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=1048) seed minus 1 to get a random one. And I am going&nbsp; to add the car to the prompt with a car. Since&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=1057) this is anime, these two styles are anime, I am&nbsp; adding the anime word here. And let's generate&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=1063) again. To see how it is going to merge 3 images&nbsp; into the one image with the FLUX Redux. As you&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=1070) combine more images, the speed drops. Currently&nbsp; it is 2.25. It was 1.97 when there were 2 images.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=1080) By the way, this YOLO model is also automatically&nbsp; downloaded by the SwarmUI Unified Downloader that&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=1087) I have made. Currently inpainting the face. It is&nbsp; already good. But it is going to be better. So if&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=1093) your face is better initially, you will get even&nbsp; more better image when you inpaint the face. So&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=1101) the base initial image that you get matters most.&nbsp; And the image has been generated. As you can see,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=1109) all 3 images are now merged into a single&nbsp; new concept. And this was the third image&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=1117) that we have used. When you pay attention,&nbsp; you will notice that the third image is also&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=1123) excellently put and combined into the image. So,&nbsp; you see this was its style, its environment. And&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=1131) we can see that environment is put there into&nbsp; the final composition of the image. So you can&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=1137) even combine more images. This is how the Redux&nbsp; model works. Now it is time to move how to use&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=1144) the FLUX Canny DEV model and the FLUX Depth DEV&nbsp; model. You can also use their LoRAs, however,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=1152) their LoRAs are extremely low quality, so I&nbsp; don't recommend to use them. I compared them,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=1159) but I will still show them how to use. Let's begin&nbsp; with using the FLUX Canny model. And finally,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=1167) after those two, I am going to show how to do&nbsp; inpainting and outpainting. So keep watching.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=1173) To use the FLUX Canny dev model, we need a Canny&nbsp; preprocessed image. And also, we need to select&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=1180) the accurate model. So let's open a new tab. And&nbsp; I am going to load the FLUX Canny dev model load&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=1186) now. When you select it, it will also load it when&nbsp; you generate. But I'm just speeding up the things.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=1192) And you see the image prompt has been disappeared.&nbsp; So as I said, you need to have preprocessed&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=1199) Canny image. How we gonna do it? To be able to do&nbsp; it, I am going to use ControlNet of the SwarmUI.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=1207) So the ControlNet is here. First of all, you&nbsp; need to have installed ControlNet preprocessor.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=1212) Because we are going to use the preprocessor of&nbsp; the ControlNet. Click this. And it will ask you.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=1217) Click OK. It is going to install and make it&nbsp; ready. You can watch the status from the logs&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=1224) as usual with the debug option. You will see what&nbsp; it is doing. And it is installing the ControlNet&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=1230) preprocessor right now. So let's just wait until&nbsp; the backend has been loaded. If it doesn't load,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=1236) you just can restart. But it usually works. OK.&nbsp; So it has been installed. Now. First, choose the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=1244) file that you want to use as a Canny model. So&nbsp; I am going to use this dragon bird, duck bird,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=1251) whatever you can call it. Then, which preprocessor&nbsp; is best? So I have compared the preprocessors and&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=1258) I find that Pyre Canny preprocessor is working&nbsp; best. After selecting it, click preview. And it&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=1265) will generate the preprocessed Canny preprocessed&nbsp; image. It will first download the preprocessor,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=1271) then it will preprocess it, so it will take&nbsp; some time. And also always it will load the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=1276) model first. OK. So this is the preprocessed&nbsp; image. There is one another very crucial thing&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=1282) that you need to be careful of when you are&nbsp; generating the preprocessed Canny or depth image&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=1288) for the FLUX tools models. You see this&nbsp; image, this input image has 3 to 2 aspect&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=1294) ratio. Therefore. If I generate the Canny&nbsp; map or depth map with aspect ratio of 1 to 1,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=1301) let's see what happens. So I'm going to select&nbsp; the Canny preprocessor from here, this one,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=1306) and preview. And let's see the result. And this&nbsp; is the result. So you see that image turned into&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=1314) this one. This is looking very bad. So how to&nbsp; fix it? Pay attention to the aspect ratio here&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=1319) or the resolution and select the aspect ratio if&nbsp; it exists here. Or set custom resolution to the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=1327) any resolution that you need. So since this is&nbsp; 3 to 2, I make it 3 to 2 and I will preview and&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=1333) generate again. And you will notice that the newly&nbsp; generated Canny image is way better. So this was 1&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=1340) to 1 and this is 3 to 2. You see 3 to 2 is looking&nbsp; way better, way more accurate. This applies to the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=1348) depth preprocessor as well. So pay attention to&nbsp; the input image aspect ratio when you are using&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=1357) preprocessors to generate Canny or depth map to&nbsp; use them inside FLUX tools. And this is the depth&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=1364) map of the same image with 3 to 2. Now we are&nbsp; not going to use the ControlNet. We are going&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=1371) to use this as an input image. So drag and drop it&nbsp; into here and then use as init. Then turn off the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=1380) ControlNet. Don't forget it. It doesn't work with&nbsp; ControlNet. And you will see the init image is&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=1385) ready. Now what you need to do is set this as init&nbsp; image creativity 1. Don't forget that. And you&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=1392) don't need to change anything else here. I have&nbsp; compared everything. All of this information is&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=1398) shared in this txt file. Then what else you need&nbsp; to do? You need to set the FLUX CFG scale to 30.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=1408) Like this. This scroller will go up to 10 but&nbsp; you can type it here as 30. And that's it. This&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=1415) is working best. I have compared all of them.&nbsp; Don't worry. And let's generate an image but&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=1422) let's first write our prompt a dragon bird like&nbsp; this. Ok generate. Now it is going to generate an&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=1429) image based on this. Because this is used as an&nbsp; init image and the FLUX canny model is selected.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=1436) The generation speed is even faster than the&nbsp; regular dev model. You see 1.35 seconds per&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=1444) it. And the image has been generated. This is the&nbsp; generated image. It's a decent quality compared&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=1450) to the simple prompt that we have entered. And&nbsp; more importantly this was the base image. You see&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=1458) it is matching it very accurately when you think&nbsp; about how canny model works. So it is keeping the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=1464) structure, the environment. It's a pretty accurate&nbsp; image. And when we use the LoRA model now you will&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=1471) see the difference. So to be able to use the LoRA&nbsp; model I am going to use the same seed parameter&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=1477) here. And I am going to select FLUX 1 dev. I am&nbsp; going to go to LoRAs and I am going to select&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=1483) FLUX canny dev LoRA. Which LoRA strength you&nbsp; should use. Unfortunately none of them is working&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=1490) very good but let's use like 0.97 and generate.&nbsp; So remember as a model we select FLUX 1 dev and&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=1500) as a LoRA we select the canny dev LoRA. LoRA canny&nbsp; is also exactly same speed there is no speed delay&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=1508) added when we are using it. And this is the image&nbsp; of the LoRA canny. Unfortunately it is very bad&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=1515) therefore I do not recommend it. Now how we are&nbsp; going to use the FLUX depth model. So let's cancel&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=1522) this LoRA. Let's go to the models and let's select&nbsp; the FLUX depth. You see here depth dev model. You&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=1530) can also see the selected model here. Right click&nbsp; and load now. To be able to use the depth model&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=1535) we need to have depth image. So to get the depth&nbsp; image I am also going to use the ControlNet again.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=1542) Go to ControlNet and select the preprocessor&nbsp; depth. You see there are several depths I have&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=1548) compared all of them. The depth anything and depth&nbsp; anything version 2 working best. Let's go with&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=1554) depth anything version 2. This is a little bit&nbsp; more accurate. Click preview. First time it will&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=1561) download the depth model then it will generate&nbsp; the preview as usual. So the depth mask of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=1568) image has been generated. Drag and drop it here&nbsp; and use as init. Then turn off the ControlNet.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=1575) So what is changing? Nothing. Everything is&nbsp; same as the FLUX canny. And let's generate&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=1582) the image and let's see the output of the depth&nbsp; model. The speed of depth model is same. You see&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=1588) 1.35 second IT on RTX 3090 Ti. Okay so the image&nbsp; has been generated and depth model is working way&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=1597) better way way better than the canny model. So&nbsp; this is how you use depth and canny models of&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=1604) the FLUX tools. Now as a next step I am going to&nbsp; show the FLUX inpainting. As an inpainting model&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=1611) we are going to use FLUX 1 fill dev model here.&nbsp; This one. Load now. You see the fill dev model&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=1617) is selected. This is used for both inpainting and&nbsp; outpainting of the images. Now this part is really&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=1625) important because the interface of the SwarmUI is&nbsp; a little bit harder to use for image inpainting&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=1632) or image editing overall. But I am going to show&nbsp; you everything. Don't worry. So first of all we&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=1639) need to choose our editing image. To choose your&nbsp; editing image I am going to use this image as an&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=1645) example. You see this was for Invoke AI. This was&nbsp; also generated with my DreamBooth / Fine-tuned&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=1652) model. So click edit image and it will open the&nbsp; image editor window. So I am using my mouse wheel.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=1662) You really need your mouse wheel otherwise it will&nbsp; be super hard. You see the orange window here it&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=1669) is the camera. So for inpainting it is pretty&nbsp; straightforward. You need to have mask here. So&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=1676) select this mask. Make sure that it is selected&nbsp; the mask here. Then you need to use paint brush&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=1683) and mask the part where you are going to inpaint.&nbsp; Remember this is totally dependent on your input&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=1690) image resolution. Therefore if your input image&nbsp; is high resolution it is going to use huge amount&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=1695) of VRAM. Don't forget that. All right. Then what&nbsp; we are going to do is let's make the seed random&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=1702) and I am going to select the paint brush. You&nbsp; see there is now new icons at the bottom. Which&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=1709) is radius. I am going to make the radius bigger&nbsp; and I will zoom with my mouse wheel. And I am&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=1716) going to mask it like this. Select the paint brush&nbsp; again and mask all the area that you want. You can&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=1721) make a perfect mask this is up to you. Now we are&nbsp; ready to do inpainting. What you want to inpaint&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=1728) I am going to inpaint into like this. SwarmUI&nbsp; text on a board. Like this. SwarmUI text on a&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=1736) board. You can also add some prompts. Like. Let's&nbsp; say glowing and burning. SwarmUI text. So what&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=1743) else we need to change. Again the FLUX guidance&nbsp; scale is 30 for inpainting. Init image creativity&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=1751) is 1. And what else we need. None of these are&nbsp; selected. And let's use a certain seed because I&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=1758) am going to test something else and show you it's&nbsp; a newest feature. Okay 40 steps. And the sampling&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=1765) is default. And init image creativity is 1. And&nbsp; the FLUX guidance scale is 30. So these are the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=1772) best settings as you are seeing right now. Let's&nbsp; generate. The inpainting speed is also same as&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=1778) you are seeing. And the inpainted image has been&nbsp; generated. It only inpainted the masked area as&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=1786) you are seeing right now. Okay to show the other&nbsp; example which is mask shrink growth which lets the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=1793) AI to use the surrounding area more accurately.&nbsp; I am going to inpaint my hair. So let's brush my&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=1802) hair. This will be a good example. Okay let's make&nbsp; it this. Okay let's control-z. Okay. Okay let's&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=1811) mask the hair as much as possible. When you are&nbsp; holding the control key with your mouse wheel you&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=1817) can change the radius like this. Okay let's make&nbsp; the hair like red hair. Something like this. And&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=1824) let's generate an image then I will try the mask&nbsp; shrink growth. Actually let's make a comparison.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=1830) So red hair and go to the tools. Go to the grid&nbsp; and let's change the mask shrink growth from here.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=1838) So let's search for mask shrink growth. Let's try&nbsp; this as 0 versus like 128. Shrink test. If you&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=1848) get something like this it is not important and&nbsp; generate grid. Let's see what we are going to get.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=1854) Oh by the way we didn't remove this masking.&nbsp; So let's just interrupt all sessions. And to&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=1860) unmask it there is erasers radius let's erase this&nbsp; mask now generate grid. Don't forget we'll see the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=1867) masks on the screen here. Yeah I know it's hard to&nbsp; see but the mask will be here on your screen. Okay&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=1873) the grid has been completed let's open it and&nbsp; let's see the difference. So this is mask shrink&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=1879) growth is 0 and this is 128 and when I look at the&nbsp; difference I think 128 is looking more natural as&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=1889) you are seeing right now. So it is up to you. You&nbsp; can always make comparisons and see which one is&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=1895) working better but I like it. It is really really&nbsp; cool and this is based on the mask that we have&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=1902) made and it is really looking natural if you ask&nbsp; my opinion. So it is up to you. You can compare&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=1909) and see which one is working better. So finally I&nbsp; am going to show you how to outpaint the images.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=1916) Which is one of the most important one. So let's&nbsp; open a new page. For this one we are using FLUX&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=1922) 1 fill dev model. Because this is both inpainting&nbsp; and outpainting. I will show the example on this&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=1928) image. So drag it and drop it that image here&nbsp; and I will use as init. You can also pick the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=1935) init image from choose file from here. Init image&nbsp; creativity is set 1. This is important. These&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=1941) other options are not making any difference with&nbsp; init image that I have found. FLUX guidance scale&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=1948) is again 30 and the more steps you do you get&nbsp; better results. I have tested that. So we are&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=1954) going to do edit image again and this yellow&nbsp; part is our camera. So to outpaint it I need&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=1964) to move this image out of the camera so it will&nbsp; fill the empty camera area. How am I going to do&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=1972) that? First of all I need to select the image from&nbsp; here. You see I have selected the image. Go to the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=1977) move and then drag and drop the image out of the&nbsp; camera like this. So I am going to zoom in and I&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=1984) will be sure that it is properly positioned like&nbsp; this. Okay. So you can even outpaint like 40%,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=1991) 45%. You can also do small steps. Small steps&nbsp; would work better. But I just noticed that this&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=1998) is not the image that I wanted to outpaint this&nbsp; was already outpainted. Which one was the init&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=2005) image that I wanted to use. It was this one. This&nbsp; was the original image. So let's click edit image&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=2012) again and let's click the move and select the&nbsp; image. Let's move it. Sorry that this will be&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=2018) like two times showing but you understand the&nbsp; logic. Okay and here. Okay let's zoom in. Okay.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=2026) Yeah I know it is not that so easy but I am going&nbsp; to outpaint it like 50% right now. Then how we&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=2033) are going to outpaint? Click mask and select the&nbsp; paint brush. Set your radius and mask this corner&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=2043) area. Yeah I know it is hard to make a straight&nbsp; line. It is not that important. And that's it. Now&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=2048) you are ready. A bird dragon. So we can make&nbsp; this random seed or whatever we want. I will&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=2055) generate like 8 images. The FLUX guidance scale&nbsp; is 30 as we set and the image creativity is 1.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=2062) Then are we ready? Yes. Make sure that the grid&nbsp; is not selected. Generate. Now it will generate&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=2068) 8 images. Alright the generations has been&nbsp; completed and there are several very important&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=2075) things. The first generations that I have made&nbsp; with a bird dragon generated unwanted objects&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=2083) like this. Why? Because we are really expanding&nbsp; the picture hugely. Huge percentage. Therefore,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=2092) it is adding unwanted objects like this. If you&nbsp; define the prompt with an extreme details. I mean&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=2100) something like this. I have used the chat GPT&nbsp; to generate this. Then it is adding additional&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=2107) good images as well. If you are looking something&nbsp; like this. Yes you can use. However. If you want&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=2113) to make the image generation something like this.&nbsp; Like this. Like this. I mean look at this. This&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=2120) is just perfect. You can not get this in the paid&nbsp; Photoshop, in Midjourney, wherever, whichever the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=2128) platform or other model you are using. All of them&nbsp; is just perfect. Just amazing. So the key to get&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=2135) this is not using any prompt. Just empty. When you&nbsp; leave it empty, the FLUX is amazingly generating&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=2145) the rest of the image. Just perfect. Just amazing.&nbsp; So pick the best one that you liked. I mean all of&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=2151) them is just amazing. I can use every one of them.&nbsp; So I am going to use this one. However this image&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=2157) is now incomplete. It is not like the full image.&nbsp; So how we gonna make it full? Drag and drop this&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=2165) image into this area. And then click these three&nbsp; dots and click store full canvas to history. Then&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=2174) it will make it a complete image like this. Just&nbsp; purely amazing. Now you can continue expanding&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=2181) from right from top and make this image fully&nbsp; complete. So to do that, we need to click X and&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=2188) click edit image and the process is exactly same.&nbsp; Select the image. Click move. Let's move it a&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=2196) little bit bottom like this to expand it. But you&nbsp; see that it is just extremely powerful to expand&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=2203) in any direction. So let's make it expand like&nbsp; this. Then select mask. Click paint tool. Mask the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=2212) border like this. And continue generating images&nbsp; without any prompt. And it will automatically&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=2219) expand our image. This is just mind blowing&nbsp; quality. You see it started the expansion. And it&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=2227) is already looking good from the preview image. I&nbsp; can see that. If you don't like the preview of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=2233) image, you don't need to wait fully. Just click&nbsp; this X icon. And it will cancel the generation as&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=2239) you are seeing right now. Then click generate and&nbsp; it will continue generating. So I will show one&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=2245) more time how we were making the final image.&nbsp; Drag and drop to the camera view. Click three&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=2251) dots. Store full canvas to history. Then the image&nbsp; is ready. Let's just download the image more and&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=2259) download. So from what to this image. Original&nbsp; starting image was this one. So let's see them in&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=2267) the same image. Like this. This image. Into this&nbsp; image. Zoom in. Okay. Magnificent. So this was the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=2275) original image. And this is the final image. Look&nbsp; at the expansion. There is no such outpainting&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=2282) exists as good as this one. We have outpainted&nbsp; the image into the perfect quality image. The&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=2289) environment. The wings. I mean it is just perfect.&nbsp; From this image to this image. I mean look at this&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=2297) quality. Look at this outpainting. This image.&nbsp; To this image. It is just mind-blowing. This&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=2303) image. To this image. Now we have seen everything&nbsp; regarding the FLUX tools. The usage is exactly&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=2311) same on RunPod and Massed Compute. First, I will&nbsp; show how to install and start using on Massed&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=2318) Compute. Then I will show how to install and start&nbsp; using on RunPod. I am not going to repeat the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=2324) parts that I have shown in the Windows tutorial.&nbsp; So it is mandatory to use the Windows tutorial&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=2331) part. Now we will begin with installing on Massed&nbsp; Compute. Before starting the Massed Compute part,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=2337) at the top of our main post, if you join our&nbsp; Discord, I appreciate that you see our Discord&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=2388) my LinkedIn account, when you open my LinkedIn&nbsp; account, you will see my account, you can follow&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=2395) me on here as well. I appreciate that. Now we are&nbsp; beginning the cloud part of the tutorial. Okay, we&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=2402) are starting to cloud part of the tutorial. This&nbsp; part is especially useful for people who doesn't&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=2409) have a powerful GPU and who wants to scale their&nbsp; generation speed. So type Massed Compute, search&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=2416) for Massed Compute Instructions. The instructions&nbsp; of the Massed Compute is here, the installation is&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=2422) exactly the same, the initial installation, only&nbsp; the FLUX tools will be different. I recommend you&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=2428) to use this link to sign up, I appreciate that.&nbsp; So after signing up, you can go to the billing and&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=2435) set your billing. You see the billing is here,&nbsp; set like $10 and $10 here, it is up to you to&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=2441) set. Once you have the setup, go to the deploy&nbsp; and in here we are going to select our category&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=2448) creator and we are going to select SECourses.&nbsp; This is our image. This is the most important&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=2454) part. What I recommend is RTX A6000 GPU and our&nbsp; coupon, which is SECourses and then make the GPU&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=2463) quantity according to your needs. If you select 1,&nbsp; it will work fine. If you select 2, you can speed&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=2468) up your generation 2x. So select 1 and deploy. And&nbsp; verify. And then click deploy. However, there are&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=2475) no available GPU right now because Massed Compute&nbsp; is extremely popular because of the features it&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=2482) has. However, I am talking with the team and they&nbsp; are going to add more GPUs hopefully very soon.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=2487) Alternatively, you can use the ALT config if it&nbsp; is available. It only has lesser RAM memory. The&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=2494) coupon works and it is $0.30 per hour after the&nbsp; coupon applied. If it is also not available, you&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=2499) can use other GPUs. Like L40s if it is available&nbsp; or L40. So you can use any of them. However,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=2507) the coupon will work only with RTX A6000 ALT&nbsp; config and RTX A6000. So currently I am going to&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=2513) use RTX A6000 NVLink. There is 1 available GPU.&nbsp; The coupon will not work on that unfortunately.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=2521) And click deploy. So once the machine has been&nbsp; generated, it will start initialization part.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=2527) We are updating our image. Hopefully very soon&nbsp; it will be up-to-date with CUDA latest version,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=2534) the latest drivers, latest installations. And&nbsp; the initialization part will become way faster.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=2540) We are working on that. So when you are watching&nbsp; this tutorial, hopefully it will be way faster to&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=2544) initialize. And to connect the initialized virtual&nbsp; machine, the cloud machine, we are going to use&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=2550) the ThinLinc client. It is here. Click that link.&nbsp; If you did set up this, you are ready. But if you&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=2556) didn't, download according to your platform.&nbsp; You see you can use it on the Windows, Mac,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=2560) Linux, wherever you are using. After download,&nbsp; just click on it. Click yes. Click next. Click&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=2567) next. Install. That's it. And click finish.&nbsp; Now with the ThinLinc client to connect, if you&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=2573) want to synchronize the small files between your&nbsp; computer and the Massed Compute virtual machine,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=2579) click options. Go to the local devices, uncheck&nbsp; all, and just check the drives, details. In here,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=2585) remove whatever is available. Click add. So you&nbsp; are going to add an existing folder from your&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=2591) computer. You can also copy paste the folder&nbsp; path to here, which I recommend. So generate&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=2596) a folder in one of your drives. For example,&nbsp; I have generated this folder. I copy this,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=2602) paste it here. Then I will select the permission&nbsp; read and write so it can work both way, upload and&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=2607) download and click OK. As an optimization,&nbsp; if your ThinLinc client is working slow,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=2613) uncheck this, select tight, select custom, 9,&nbsp; allow JPEG compression 0, and set the color level&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=2620) medium and SSH compression. This is the speed of&nbsp; your ThinLinc client slightly, however, it will&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=2626) reduce the quality of the image. So I'm going to&nbsp; make this auto select for now. And just like this.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=2632) And OK. Now we need to wait initialization&nbsp; to be completed. One of the advantages of&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=2637) the Massed Compute is that not only the devices&nbsp; are great, the speed is great, but also our image&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=2643) is specially crafted. It has all the things that&nbsp; you need, like SwarmUI automatically installed,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=2649) one trainer automatically installed. Forge web UI&nbsp; automatically installed. And many other things.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=2653) We are adding things that you are demanding from&nbsp; us. We also have some base model automatically&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=2660) installed. It is coming up with the image you&nbsp; are going to see in a moment. And hopefully we&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=2665) are going to update it even into a better version&nbsp; very soon. So the machine has been initialized.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=2671) So copy the IP address, paste it here like this.&nbsp; You see, copy the username, paste it here like&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=2677) this and copy the password and paste here then&nbsp; connect. Click continue. Click start. And we are&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=2684) into ThinLinc client. What if, if you want to&nbsp; turn off your computer and connect again, just&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=2689) click X and turn off the ThinLinc client. Open&nbsp; the ThinLinc client again and copy the password&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=2695) again. It will remember the last settings. Do not&nbsp; click end existing session because it is going to&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=2701) terminate all of the running applications. You&nbsp; will not lose the existing data on the server,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=2707) but all the running applications will be&nbsp; terminated. You only need that option when&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=2711) you are having synchronization problems or when&nbsp; you are not able to access the machine. So this&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=2717) is the interface. This is going to get updated. It&nbsp; is going to become better. The SwarmUI is already&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=2723) installed. So to update the SwarmUI, first run&nbsp; this one. You see, this is for update. When you&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=2730) hover your mouse, you will see that it is run&nbsp; stable SwarmUI update. It says stable SwarmUI,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=2735) but it is the latest SwarmUI. So double click it.&nbsp; It will update the SwarmUI to the latest version.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=2741) Also it will update the ComfyUI backend to the&nbsp; latest version since it is automatically selected.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=2746) Just wait. And it will take less than one minute.&nbsp; Yes, it is updated and started. You see the Massed&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=2752) Compute advantage is huge and we are keeping this&nbsp; image updated, not like the RunPod. However, I am&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=2758) not going to use it inside the ThinLinc client. I&nbsp; am going to use it from my computer. To do that, I&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=2764) will start it from here. But first, let's download&nbsp; FLUX Tools models. You can download the FLUX tools&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=2771) models from these links as I have shown in the&nbsp; beginning of the tutorial. However, I recommend&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=2776) your SwarmUI unified downloader. You see it is&nbsp; here. Click it. Go to the very bottom of the post&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=2781) where you will see the attachments. This is the&nbsp; link. It is here. Download it. Move the downloaded&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=2785) attachment into your synchronization folder&nbsp; wherever you have set. It is inside here. You can&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=2790) also download this directly in the ThinLinc client&nbsp; as well. It is up to you. But I recommend to use&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=2795) synchronization for smaller files. Because it is&nbsp; working fast. So how you are going to access that&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=2800) file? Open the home button from here. Go to thin&nbsp; drives. Go to the shared folder. This is shared&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=2806) between your computer and the cloud machine. Then&nbsp; where is the downloader? The SwarmUI downloader&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=2811) is here. It is the latest version. Move it into&nbsp; the downloads. Never use anything inside this&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=2817) synchronization folder. Always copy them into&nbsp; the machine like this. Into the download sfolder.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=2823) Right click. Extract here. Enter inside the&nbsp; folder. All of my scripts are in here. They have&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=2828) the same format. Open the Massed Compute download&nbsp; instructions txt file. Then copy this command.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=2834) This is the command that you need. Copy it.&nbsp; Ctrl C. Open a terminal here. You see three dots&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=2840) icon inside the folder. That is important. Open&nbsp; terminal. Right click and paste. And it will give&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=2846) you all the options that you want to download. So&nbsp; if you want to replicate exactly as I did in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=2853) Windows tutorial. What you need? Option 1. Since&nbsp; this is a big machine with 48 GBs of GPU you can&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=2860) download FP16 versions. Then the option 5. Then&nbsp; the option 11. If you want to download the YOLO&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=2867) models for face segmentation and auto inpainting&nbsp; the face. Then 13, 14, 15, 16, 17. Actually you&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=2876) don't need LoRA here because it is way lower&nbsp; quality but it is up to you if you want to use&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=2881) them on a different base model 16, 17, and 18. Now&nbsp; look at the download speed. You will be shocked&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=2889) by the speed. It is mind-blowingly fast. We are&nbsp; seeing right now over 600MB per second. Sometimes&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=2898) 800MB. So you see it is going to take less than 1&nbsp; minute to download 24GB of the base model. This is&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=2906) why I like the Massed Compute. They are just the&nbsp; highest quality cloud service that you can find.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=2913) They are also very responsive. They also have&nbsp; staff members in our discord. We can also chat&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=2917) with them. We can complain to them. We can ask&nbsp; questions to them. And they are really really&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=2923) helpful. So you see the base FLUX1 dev model took&nbsp; only 38 seconds to download. 24GB of file only&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=2931) downloaded in 38 seconds. So you can become ready&nbsp; in less than 2 minutes after the machine has been&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=2939) initialized. This is why the Massed Compute is&nbsp; the number one. And we are almost done. We are&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=2943) downloading the latest models. So the models have&nbsp; been downloaded. It took less than let's calculate&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=2950) 3 minutes. All of the models are downloaded. I&nbsp; am going to start the SwarmUI on the shared link.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=2957) You see in the left bottom there is run cloudflare&nbsp; stable SwarmUI. This is going to start the SwarmUI&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=2964) on cloudflare. We are going to see a link here.&nbsp; Let me zoom. Okay you see here. This is the link&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=2970) that you need to start. Click this link. It will&nbsp; open a new page like this. Then copy this link and&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=2978) move back to your computer. So now I can use the&nbsp; SwarmUI in my computer browser. But it will run&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=2986) on the Massed Compute. The rest is exactly same&nbsp; as the Windows tutorial part. There is only one&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=2993) difference that I recommend. Since this is a dual&nbsp; gpu. Add another ComfyUI backend to be able to&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=2999) generate multiple images. Copy this. Click ComfyUI&nbsp; self starting. Click ok. And paste it here. You&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=3006) see. I am duplicating. Then set the gpu id 1.&nbsp; So now when you generate multiple images like&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=3013) 10 image it will use both of the GPUs at the same&nbsp; time since there are 2 GPUs on this machine. When&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=3021) I go to the server info I can see that. So how you&nbsp; can backup your files. You can upload them to the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=3026) Hugging Face, onedrive, google drive. If they are&nbsp; not very big you can also use the synchronization&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=3032) folder. Once you are done with the usage you need&nbsp; to terminate your machine. Do not forget that.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=3039) Because if you don't terminate it will keep using&nbsp; your credits. You see everything else is as same&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=3045) as using on the Windows computer here. Therefore&nbsp; I will just skip the rest. And I will terminate&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=3052) the machine to show you. How you are going to&nbsp; terminate from here. If you click the stop.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=3056) It will not stop using your credits. So you need&nbsp; to terminate your machine. And I will terminate.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=3062) And that's it. All the data has been deleted. Now.&nbsp; I will show how to use the FLUX tools SwarmUI on&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=3068) the RunPod. So in our public post search for&nbsp; RunPod and go to the RunPod instructions. You&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=3075) see here. I recommend to read here. Also if you&nbsp; register with this link. I appreciate that. Click&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=3081) this link. Register your RunPod account. Login.&nbsp; Once you did login. Go to the billing. And set up&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=3088) your billing as you wish. Then go to the pods. And&nbsp; in here click deploy. Now. You can pick any GPU&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=3095) to use. It is up to you. I am recommending secure&nbsp; cloud because it is way faster than the community&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=3100) cloud. But you can also go with community cloud if&nbsp; you are going to use it for a long time. Because&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=3105) the initial setup is slow but the rest is same&nbsp; speed. So therefore it is up to you. If you are&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=3110) short on time. Go with secure cloud. If you want&nbsp; to use permanent storage from here. I already have&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=3116) tutorials for them. You see RunPod permanent&nbsp; network storage. You see RunPod massive tutorial&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=3121) for RunPodCTL. So you can watch them. But I am not&nbsp; going to show that right now. So deploy. Secure&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=3127) cloud. I recommend US Texas 3. That is the fastest&nbsp; one. But you can use any of them. And let's go&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=3134) with L40s GPU. This is a very good GPU. It can&nbsp; load FP16 since it is 48 gigabytes. But you can&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=3142) also go with the RTX 4090. Let's go with dual L40s&nbsp; GPU. So which template you need to use. The latest&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=3151) recommended template is written here. So always&nbsp; read the RunPod instructions. So change template.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=3157) Type PyTorch. And select the PyTorch version. For&nbsp; example like this one 2.2.0. Then select the GPU&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=3165) count. That how many you want to use. You can also&nbsp; use single GPU. And click edit template. Set the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=3171) volume disk according to the models that you are&nbsp; going to download. Let's download 200 gigabytes.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=3176) Also you need to set 7801 port. To connect the&nbsp; SwarmUI interface. Set. Overrides. Don't forget&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=3184) that. And we are going to deploy on demand. But&nbsp; I see that this GPU is not available dual on us&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=3191) texas 3. So let's go with 4090. Because this is&nbsp; a tutorial proposal. So it doesn't matter very&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=3197) much. And deploy on demand. And my pods. And it&nbsp; will start the initializing the template. Since&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=3204) this is an official template it is super fast&nbsp; to be loaded. And we are going to install the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=3209) latest version. We are not dependent on any&nbsp; pre-configured version. We are not using any&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=3214) pre-compiled version. We are always using the&nbsp; latest version. It is also super important to&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=3218) use the latest version. So it is ready. Then click&nbsp; connect. Connect the Jupyter lab interface. In the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=3224) left top you see there is upload icon. So how you&nbsp; gonna install. The installation is same. In the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=3230) very bottom of the post you will see that there is&nbsp; install linux.sh file. And install linux fix step&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=3237) 2. The instructions all written here. I am going&nbsp; to show in a moment. So upload both of the files&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=3243) into your workspace like this. From this icon.&nbsp; Select them and upload. Then open a new terminal.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=3250) So first install with this command. Copy paste&nbsp; it. It will start installation. Unfortunately&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=3256) RunPod is not as straight as the Massed Compute.&nbsp; It is a little bit more harder to use. So when you&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=3262) see this local URL. That means that it has been&nbsp; started. Go to my pods. Then click connect HTTP&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=3271) Port 7801. If it is not appeared. Refresh this&nbsp; page. And click connect. And connect whether&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=3277) it is orange or not. Then you will get to this&nbsp; installer agree. Customize settings. Modern dark.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=3284) Whatever you wish. Next. ComfyUI local. I am not&nbsp; going to download anything. Next. And I am sure&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=3289) install. The installation speed totally depends on&nbsp; the pod that you got. Some pods could be broken.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=3295) They could be very slow. So RunPod storage system&nbsp; is not as fast as Massed Compute storage system.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=3303) However they have permanent storage system. And on&nbsp; RunPod you can stop the machine. And it will use&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=3308) very little amount of credits. And you can start&nbsp; and again use wherever you are left. Unfortunately&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=3314) this is not available on Massed Compute yet. But&nbsp; however hopefully it is coming soon. So you can&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=3319) monitor the installation status from here or on&nbsp; here. From the usual cmd window. Just wait here&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=3326) for installation. Initial installation has&nbsp; been completed. You need to wait. Backends&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=3330) are still loading. You need to wait until it&nbsp; is fully loaded. Go to the logs. Debug. After&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=3335) the initial installation it is going to install&nbsp; the missing libraries. So wait until everything&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=3341) is installed and backends are fully loaded. All&nbsp; right. So the installation has been completed.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=3347) We can see that backends loaded. Now there is&nbsp; second part of installation. This is for to&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=3353) fix onnxruntime error. So this is not mandatory.&nbsp; But if you want. Copy this. Go back to your pod.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=3361) Open a new terminal. And copy paste. It is going&nbsp; to install the missing ONNX library. After that&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=3369) go to the server and backends. Turn it off. Then&nbsp; turn it on. So the changes will be applied. Now&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=3376) to be able to use we need to download the models&nbsp; we are lacking right now. So as I shown in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=3382) beginning you can download them from here. However&nbsp; I am going to use the SwarmUI unified downloader.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=3387) This is the best way of using them. Click here&nbsp; to download. Then go to your workspace like this.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=3394) Click this upload icon. Select the downloaded&nbsp; zip file. Wait until uploaded. Yes. Then right&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=3400) click. And extract archive. And it will extract&nbsp; the installation. Refresh by clicking here. Open&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=3407) the RunPod download instructions txt file.&nbsp; Then you will see the download command here.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=3413) Copy this. Open a new terminal. Paste it. And you&nbsp; will get the options. Whichever you want. Since&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=3421) this is a 24gb gpu I am going to download&nbsp; the FP8 version of the FLUX dev as I have&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=3429) shown in the windows part of the tutorial. But I&nbsp; recommend you to get 48gb of GPU and download the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=3436) fp16 version. So we are going to download the&nbsp; base fp8 version which is here not the scaled&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=3443) one because I am not sure if FLUX tools would be&nbsp; compatible with the scaled. So download 10. Then&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=3449) should download the fp8 version of the T5. It is&nbsp; option 6. And I did hit enter inaccurately. I was&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=3458) going to type more but it started downloading.&nbsp; After the download I will download the rest of&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=3462) the models. So if you hit enter accidentally&nbsp; we will continue. Since the downloader scripts&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=3469) that I have made is super optimized you see even&nbsp; on RunPod we are getting very very good speeds.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=3476) However if you download them in the regular way&nbsp; they will be slower than this one because this is&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=3481) super optimized with special techniques. Moreover&nbsp; if you want to upload big files here do not use&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=3489) this upload file because it will not work for big&nbsp; files. Only for small files it will work. What you&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=3495) can use alternatively is RunPodctl and also this&nbsp; tutorial is what you need. Upload to Hugging Face&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=3503) and download from there. Okay let's continue&nbsp; to download. So it is continuing to asking us&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=3508) which we are going to do. Lets download the best&nbsp; face models face inpainting. Then the FLUX tools&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=3515) which are 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18 and hit enter.&nbsp; However I do not recommend the LoRA of the Depth&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=3525) and Canny because as I have shown in the windows&nbsp; tutorial they are very low quality compared to&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=3531) the full checkpoint. But if you want to use Depth&nbsp; and Canny models on a custom fine-tuned FLUX model&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=3539) then you can download the LoRAs and see how they&nbsp; are performing. So the rest of the models are also&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=3544) getting downloaded. We can see the download speed&nbsp; it is sometimes 900 megabytes sometimes 1 gigabyte&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=3550) per second sometimes 300 megabytes. Still really&nbsp; really fast because I have optimized them hugely.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=3556) You see this is an amazing speed for RunPod we&nbsp; were never seeing such speeds on RunPod before&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=3562) I did this optimization. All right the models&nbsp; have been downloaded. Now we are ready to use.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hewDdVJEqOQ&t=3567) Go back to your RunPod proxy which we have been&nbsp; connected from here. Then go to models and click&nbsp;&nbsp;
