Facebook Research Meta AI has announced Voicebox today. It can syntheses speech from text, clone a voice, mimic a style and even edit an audio without any manual work. Audio editing feature looks super powerful so check out the video. I think if this gets open sourced, it can make ElevenLabs obsolete just like Open AI Whisper did make Google Cloud Speech to Text.

Introducing Voicebox: The Revolutionary AI Model for Speech Generation and Editing

Introduction:

In a groundbreaking move, Meta AI has unveiled their latest achievement - Voicebox. This cutting-edge AI model marks a significant leap forward in the realm of speech generation and editing. In this article, we will delve into the remarkable features of Voicebox and explore its potential impact on various applications. Join us as we embark on an exciting journey into the future of AI-generated voices.

Voicebox: Redefining Speech Generation:

Meta AI's Voicebox introduces a remarkable breakthrough in the field of AI-driven speech generation. Similar to the game-changing Whisper by OpenAI, Voicebox possesses the power to generalize across tasks, paving the way for revolutionary possibilities. Just as Whisper rendered Google Cloud's speech-to-text services obsolete, Voicebox promises to push the boundaries of what we thought was possible.

Multifaceted Capabilities:

Voicebox boasts an impressive array of capabilities that are poised to transform the way we interact with speech technology. Let's take a closer look at some of its key features:

Diverse Voice Options: Voicebox can seamlessly convert input text into audio using a multitude of different voices. This capability opens up a world of possibilities, offering virtual assistants and NPCs (non-player characters) the potential to possess more natural and lifelike voices.

Stylized Speech Output: One of the most intriguing aspects of Voicebox is its ability to generate stylized speech output based on text input and a short reference audio clip. By leveraging style transfer techniques, Voicebox can transpose vocal characteristics and even background noise, resulting in more immersive and authentic speech experiences.

Language Adaptability: Voicebox transcends language barriers by enabling audio production in languages beyond the original voice's repertoire. This breakthrough holds tremendous potential for facilitating authentic communication between individuals who speak different languages.

Revolutionizing Speech Editing:

Voicebox goes beyond speech generation and also offers innovative editing capabilities. By re-synthesizing specific segments and correcting misspoken words via text-to-speech conversion, Voicebox eliminates the need for time-consuming re-recordings. This feature streamlines the editing process, making it more efficient and convenient for content creators and speech professionals.

A Glimpse into the Future:

The voiceover in this very video serves as a testament to the incredible capabilities of Voicebox, as all of it was generated using this revolutionary AI model. While the source code and models are yet to be released, the impact of Voicebox is already palpable.

Conclusion:

Meta AI's Voicebox represents a groundbreaking advancement in generative AI research. With its unparalleled capabilities in speech generation and editing, Voicebox has the potential to revolutionize various industries. While we eagerly anticipate the release of its source code and models, we encourage you to visit Meta AI's website to learn more about this extraordinary technology. Witness the future of AI-generated voices and imagine the endless possibilities that Voicebox could unlock. Stay tuned for more exciting updates in the world of AI.



### Video Transcription


- [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STpc8otMN2M&t=0) Greetings everyone. Meta AI today published&nbsp; a demo page where they displayed Voicebox,&nbsp;

- [00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STpc8otMN2M&t=5) the first AI model for speech to generalize&nbsp; across tasks. This could have an impact such as&nbsp;

- [00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STpc8otMN2M&t=11) Whisper of OpenAI made. With Whisper, the Google&nbsp; Cloud's speech-to-text services became obsolete.&nbsp;

- [00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STpc8otMN2M&t=17) So let's watch their demo together. Let's take a closer look at what it can do.&nbsp;

- [00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STpc8otMN2M&t=48) Voicebox can take input text and output&nbsp; audio in a multitude of different voices.&nbsp;

- [00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STpc8otMN2M&t=62) It can also generate a stylized speech output&nbsp; based on text input and a short reference audio&nbsp;

- [00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STpc8otMN2M&t=68) clip. This could one day give virtual assistants&nbsp; and NPCs more natural sounding voices.&nbsp;

- [00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STpc8otMN2M&t=82) Style transfer enables transposition of&nbsp; vocal characteristics and background noise.&nbsp;

- [00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STpc8otMN2M&t=87) From a reference clip offer ample opportunities&nbsp; to observe and learn about the vast to a target&nbsp;

- [00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STpc8otMN2M&t=94) audio clip with text input. The quick brown fox&nbsp; jumps over the lazy dog. The quick brown fox jumps&nbsp;

- [00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STpc8otMN2M&t=102) over the lazy dog. It can also be used&nbsp; to produce audio of a voice in another&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STpc8otMN2M&t=107) language. The quick&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STpc8otMN2M&t=117) brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.&nbsp; Someday this could help people communicate&nbsp;

- [00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STpc8otMN2M&t=124) in a more authentic way even across language&nbsp; barriers. Where editing Voicebox can remove&nbsp;

- [00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STpc8otMN2M&t=130) background noise from a clip. Hi guys, thank you&nbsp; for tuning in. Today we are going to show you&nbsp;

- [00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STpc8otMN2M&t=137) by re-synthesizing a specific segment and&nbsp; correct misspoken words via text to speech&nbsp;

- [00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STpc8otMN2M&t=148) eliminating the need to re-record. Hi everyone,&nbsp; thank you for tuning in. Today we are going to&nbsp;
