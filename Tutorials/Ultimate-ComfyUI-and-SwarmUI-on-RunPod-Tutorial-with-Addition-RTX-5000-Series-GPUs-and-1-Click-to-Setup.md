### Video Transcription


- [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=0) Greetings everyone. Today, I am going to show you&nbsp; how to install the latest version of ComfyUI on&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=6) RunPod. I have been getting asked how to install&nbsp; ComfyUI and SwarmUI on RunPod properly. I have&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=15) prepared one-click installers for ComfyUI and&nbsp; SwarmUI, and the difference of this installation&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=22) is that it supports Sage Attention, xFormers,&nbsp; Flash Attention, Accelerate, DeepSpeed, Triton,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=30) whatever the latest inference library there are,&nbsp; it supports all of them. Moreover, I will show how&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=37) to install SwarmUI on RunPod and use the installed&nbsp; ComfyUI as a backend with extra parameters to&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=47) optimize it to the maximum level. You see, like&nbsp; GPU only, Sage Attention parameter. My installer's&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=55) advantage is that it supports Blackwell GPUs&nbsp; as well. So I will show everything on RTX Pro&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=63) 6000 GPU, which is the 96 gigabyte version of&nbsp; the RTX 5090. It is a little bit faster and it&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=73) has a huge amount of VRAM. So I will show you how&nbsp; to leverage this 96 gigabytes of VRAM as well,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=81) like keeping the entire model in the GPU and&nbsp; have the maximum performance. But don't worry,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=88) you can also use my installer and you can follow&nbsp; this tutorial to use everything on different GPUs&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=94) like B200, H100, RTX A6000 ADA, L40, L40S, RTX&nbsp; 4090, RTX 5090. My installer is basically working&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=106) on everything. I'm also using the official&nbsp; PyTorch template, so the initialization of&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=112) the machine is super fast. Moreover, I will be&nbsp; introducing you to my model downloader so that&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=118) you will be able to download models extremely fast&nbsp; and easy on RunPod. So let's begin the tutorial.

- [00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=126) So as usual, I have prepared a really great post&nbsp; where you will find all of the information and&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=132) installers. Let's begin with installing ComfyUI.&nbsp; Then I will install SwarmUI and I will show you&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=139) both ComfyUI and SwarmUI installation and how&nbsp; to use on RunPod. So I have downloaded my zip&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=146) file. What I need to do is just, I need&nbsp; to move it into a drive. I can use also&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=151) downloads folder and extract files into there as&nbsp; a beginning. Enter inside the extracted folder and&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=159) double-click RunPod instructions read.txt file.&nbsp; This will give you the instructions to follow.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=165) Please use this link to register to RunPod. I&nbsp; appreciate that. Then click sign up, register,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=172) put some credits. To putting some credits, go to&nbsp; billing and set your account, put some credits.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=177) Then click "Pods" section here. This is the latest&nbsp; interface of the RunPod. Today I am going to show&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=184) you on RTX Pro 6000 GPU, but you can use any&nbsp; GPU. You can also set some additional filters&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=192) from here, like the location or the disk type.&nbsp; Let's go with the NVMe disk. This is faster. You&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=200) can also filter by RAM. Moreover, you can also&nbsp; use community cloud, but these are way slower,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=205) way, way slower for installation. But they are&nbsp; also cheaper, but for the demonstration purposes,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=212) I will use the RTX Pro 6000. So what's up with&nbsp; this GPU? This GPU has 96 gigabytes of VRAM. It is&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=220) also a modern GPU. It is like RTX 5090 as a speed.&nbsp; The price is decent, not great as the Massed&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=229) Compute prices, but it is decent. Then as a next&nbsp; step, click "Change Template". This is important.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=234) You should always look at the templates that I&nbsp; write here. You need to use them. For ComfyUI,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=241) we are going to use this template. Don't worry,&nbsp; we are going to use latest libraries with this&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=246) template, so it will not matter. Okay, click&nbsp; "Change Template". You need to type here like&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=251) PyTorch, then select the PyTorch 2.2.0. This&nbsp; is the official template, therefore it will be&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=257) really fast. And then click the "Edit Template"&nbsp; and set the volume disk. Volume disk is the place&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=263) where all the models will be downloaded. So set&nbsp; it according to your needs, which models you are&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=269) going to download. I will go with 200 gigabytes.&nbsp; Moreover, you can set increased container disk.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=276) This is the temporary disk where the libraries&nbsp; will be installed, but 20 gigabyte is sufficient.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=281) Now we are also going to expose some of the&nbsp; HTTP ports to connect ComfyUI from the proxy.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=287) So export 3000, 3001 and 3002. For SwarmUI, we&nbsp; will use the Cloudflared, but you can still use&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=294) these ports if you wish, like 7860, 7861. You can&nbsp; expose as many as you want, then set overrides. So&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=303) we are done with setting the template and editing&nbsp; the template. Just click "Deploy on Demand". Then&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=309) click "My Pods". You can also click here. Wait&nbsp; for your pod to be initialized. You see, this is&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=315) a really, really good pod because these machines&nbsp; are newly built because of this GPU. This GPU is&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=321) very new and you see the pod has been initialized.&nbsp; The initialization of the pods are really fast on&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=328) RunPod, but the installation of libraries are&nbsp; usually slow. Wait until you see Jupyter Lab&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=334) become green. If it doesn't become green, still&nbsp; just click and see if it is working because&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=339) sometimes it may not. And our Jupyter interface&nbsp; has been opened. Then move the downloaded zip file&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=346) into here like this. You can also use this icon,&nbsp; "Upload files" to upload it. Wait for upload to&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=352) be completed. You will see in the bottom here.&nbsp; It is uploaded. Right-click, "Extract Archive".&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=358) So first we are going to install the ComfyUI&nbsp; with latest libraries including Flash Attention,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=363) Sage Attention, xFormers, everything, and it&nbsp; supports all of the GPUs. Then click the RunPod&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=369) instructions.txt file, double times and copy this&nbsp; installation command. Then click this plus icon,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=376) "Terminal", paste it. If it doesn't paste, you&nbsp; can right-click and paste. It will ask you to&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=380) allow and you can allow it, but with Ctrl+C,&nbsp; Ctrl+V, it is working on Windows. And now you&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=386) need to wait for installation to be completed&nbsp; patiently. The installation is the slowest part&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=391) on RunPod because of their disk speeds, because&nbsp; of the disks they use. So we just need to wait.

- [00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=397) Finally, the installation has been completed. It&nbsp; took more than 25 minutes. This is why I recommend&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=405) Massed Compute instead of RunPod because it&nbsp; would take maximum few minutes on Massed Compute.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=410) Moreover, if you don't want to install every time&nbsp; like this, I really recommend you to watch RunPod&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=418) permanent network storage tutorial to learn&nbsp; how to use network storage system of RunPod&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=425) so that you can continue using your previously&nbsp; installed machine. So since the installation has&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=431) been completed, you can verify the install logs&nbsp; with scrolling down, probably not necessary,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=436) but let's start our ComfyUI installation. For&nbsp; starting ComfyUI installation, you need to copy&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=442) this. You see, like this. If you want to add&nbsp; more new parameters to your ComfyUI, you can&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=449) add it from here. In our post, you will see some of&nbsp; the arguments like this. You see, like --gpu-only.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=457) So for example, let's use this --gpu-only. Copy&nbsp; this, open a new terminal, and let's right-click,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=465) paste, and it will ask you, allow, and hit enter.&nbsp; Now it will start the ComfyUI on the port 3000 and&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=473) we will be able to connect ComfyUI from the 3000&nbsp; proxy port. Since the installation takes huge&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=480) time, I really recommend you to download models at&nbsp; the same time, which I will show you in a moment&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=487) how to download models with our unified model&nbsp; downloader. My installation has everything that&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=493) you would need, even ComfyUI manager, Accelerate,&nbsp; Flash Attention, Sage Attention, xFormers,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=500) Deep Speed, Triton, whatever that you may need. So&nbsp; this is a perfect installation of ComfyUI with all&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=508) the libraries, and it's a clean installation. It&nbsp; is the latest version of installation. You can see&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=514) the printed messages here. It shows everything.&nbsp; So this is a really, really clean and amazing way&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=521) of installing ComfyUI on RunPod. Our installation&nbsp; zip file also has installer for Windows and Massed&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=527) Compute as well. So I am not only covering RunPod,&nbsp; but I am covering Massed Compute and Windows as&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=533) well. Moreover, the RunPod installation installs&nbsp; on Ubuntu, so if you are a Linux user, you can use&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=540) this installation. You see it shows that CUDA 0,&nbsp; NVIDIA RTX 6000 Pro Blackwell Workstation Edition,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=548) using xFormers attention. Oh, by the way, if you&nbsp; want to use Sage Attention, you need to add it here&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=555) like --use-sage-attention and it will use the&nbsp; Sage Attention instead of the xFormers. We are&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=563) still waiting for it to start. The installation,&nbsp; the model loadings, the start, all are extremely&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=569) slow on RunPod because of their disk speeds.&nbsp; Moreover, I also install GGUF support,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=575) so it is coming with GGUF. Okay, we can see that&nbsp; the server started on the 3000 port. So how we are&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=582) going to connect? Return back to Pods, click this&nbsp; and click "Connect". Select the HTTP service 3000&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=589) port and you see my ComfyUI started on the RunPod&nbsp; 3000 port. So how we are going to install SwarmUI?&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=598) By the way, you see there are a lot of examples.&nbsp; Let's go with the image generation. It says that I&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=603) need to download this model from workflow. Perhaps&nbsp; we can use FLUX. Okay, FLUX, FLUX Dev. Let's&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=610) generate an image of the FLUX Dev. You see it will&nbsp; download this model, but we also have a special&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=616) downloader and it is downloading into my computer,&nbsp; not into the RunPod. So therefore, let's continue&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=622) with SwarmUI installer and also model downloader.&nbsp; The link will be in the description of the video.

- [00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=627) So download the latest zip file and also read&nbsp; whatever written here. Click this "Upload files"&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=633) icon, upload the downloaded zip file, let's&nbsp; refresh. You will see that it is uploaded. Yes,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=638) completed. SwarmUI model downloader zip&nbsp; file, "Extract Archive". So let's open the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=644) model downloader first because while installing&nbsp; ComfyUI, you may want to download your models.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=649) All you need to do is just copy this, open a&nbsp; terminal like this, paste and hit enter and it&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=655) will start the model downloader application which&nbsp; supports downloading models both ComfyUI and both&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=661) SwarmUI. So I will make example of both of them.&nbsp; Okay, you see it started on this URL, click it,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=668) and I want to download into ComfyUI backend.&nbsp; So I right-click here, copy path, then open the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=675) started Gradio application interface. Now I will&nbsp; download into not SwarmUI models, but into here,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=682) ComfyUI. By the way, don't forget to put backslash&nbsp; here and actually we need to download into models&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=690) folder. So let's also type models here. Then we&nbsp; can select ComfyUI folder structure. So whichever&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=697) the model you want to download, let's download&nbsp; the image generation model, FLUX model, FLUX Dev,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=703) official model. Let's click download. You will&nbsp; see that it will queue and start download. Okay,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=709) it is queued, starting the download, downloading&nbsp; file. We can see the download progress here. Okay,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=714) let me zoom out. Yes. So currently the&nbsp; speed is 70 megabytes per second. This&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=720) is a terrible speed because we are on the&nbsp; cloud and on Massed Compute, I get 300, 500,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=725) sometimes gigabytes of second speed. This is a&nbsp; terrible speed for RunPod. Unfortunately, RunPod&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=732) download speed is also not great even though I am&nbsp; doing all of the optimizations. So we just need&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=737) to wait for download. It will download it into the&nbsp; accurate folder. So while installing the ComfyUI,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=743) you can download the models that you wish with&nbsp; this application. It has so many bundles like&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=750) the Wan 2.1 bundle, FLUX models bundle, HiDream&nbsp; bundle. Also image generation models, FLUX models,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=756) different ones, HiDream models or Stable Diffusion&nbsp; 1.5 models or Stable Diffusion XL models,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=763) Stable Diffusion 3.5 models. It also has&nbsp; other models like YOLO face segmentation,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=768) image upscaling. It also has text encoder models,&nbsp; video generation models like Wan 2.1, Hunyuan&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=774) models, Fast Hunyuan Skyreels, SkyVid, GenMo. It has&nbsp; some LoRAs like migration LoRA, Wan 2.1 CausVid&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=781) with LoRA. It also has some LLM models that are&nbsp; used in some of the workflows. It has VAE, Clip,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=787) Vision models, ComfyUI workflows. So as I said,&nbsp; you can use this downloader meanwhile installing&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=795) to download models to save your time. Moreover,&nbsp; if you need any more models in this application,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=802) you can always message me and hopefully I will&nbsp; include them into the downloader as soon as&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=807) possible. If this comes you so much confusing,&nbsp; you can just search from here like SDXL and it&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=814) will show you all the SDXL. Or you can search for&nbsp; FLUX and it will show you all the FLUX. So it has&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=821) an internal search feature which you can use. This&nbsp; application is really, really programmed well and&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=827) working really well, but this download speed is&nbsp; terrible for a cloud platform, unfortunately.

- [00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=833) For FLUX, we need to download Clip as well.&nbsp; So let's download this Clip model. Okay,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=838) downloading Clip. Let's also download&nbsp; the VAE of the FLUX, which is here,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=843) FLUX VAE. Yes. Example from the ComfyUI&nbsp; wiki. This already supports everything. Oh,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=850) we are missing the T5 XXL in our previous. So&nbsp; we also need to download it from our SwarmUI,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=857) T5 XXL here, T5 XXL model, T5 XXL. Now it is&nbsp; downloading the T5 XXL. We can see here. Yes,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=866) we just need to wait. Then we will be able to&nbsp; generate it as we expect, let's say. So we have&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=874) the FLUX Dev here. You see, you need to click here&nbsp; to select. We have the T5 XXL, just refresh. Okay,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=881) here. Clip Large here. This is FLUX type,&nbsp; default. We have the FLUX VAE like this. Make&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=887) sure to select them. This is FLUX guidance. So it&nbsp; is 3.5 by default. We have everything set here. We&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=895) just need to run and it should now generate&nbsp; as we want. Okay, it is loading the models.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=901) After the initial load, it should be really fast&nbsp; because we are keeping everything in the VRAM.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=906) You can download every one of these from the&nbsp; downloader interface. The best way would be&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=912) just download the FLUX models bundle and it will&nbsp; download everything. And image has been generated.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=918) It is not the greatest quality because the base&nbsp; model is not great. You can use fine-tuned models,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=924) you can use LoRAs. This was just a demonstration&nbsp; and you can already see the speed. The speed is&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=930) just mind-blowingly fast. Can we see the step&nbsp; speed somewhere? Okay, the step speed is 3.66&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=938) IT per second. This is just amazing. So it takes&nbsp; less than six seconds to generate an image on this&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=946) GPU with ComfyUI. The ComfyUI is hard to use, so&nbsp; you really should find workflows and use them. But&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=953) now I will move to the SwarmUI. Since my ComfyUI&nbsp; is already running, I need to terminate it. For&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=960) terminating it, I need to use this command. If you&nbsp; don't start the ComfyUI, you don't need it. Now I&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=966) have terminated it and my VRAM usage should&nbsp; have been dropped. Yes. Now I will install&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=972) the SwarmUI and show you how to use SwarmUI&nbsp; with ComfyUI backend, which I recommend. Okay,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=978) double-click RunPod SwarmUI install instructions,&nbsp; copy this entirely, open a new terminal,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=985) and it will automatically install the SwarmUI for&nbsp; you. Since we have installed the ComfyUI already,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=991) it will be super fast to install. So just wait for&nbsp; installation to start on the localhost. Okay, we&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=998) got the Cloudflared and also we got the localhost&nbsp; URL. Okay, the Cloudflared has started already. So&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=1005) agree, customize settings. This is important&nbsp; because don't use just install, customize&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=1010) settings, select your template. This is yourself&nbsp; on this PC. This is none because we already have&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=1017) ComfyUI. Next, I don't want to download any&nbsp; models. Next, yes, I'm sure, install. It will&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=1023) be instant as you are seeing right now. Then go&nbsp; to server, go to backends, ComfyUI self-starting.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=1029) Now this is super important. Click okay. So where&nbsp; is our ComfyUI installation? It is inside here,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=1034) ComfyUI, and it is the main.py. So copy path and&nbsp; paste it here like this. And which arguments we&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=1043) want? These are the arguments from the ComfyUI.&nbsp; --use-sage-attention and also, since this is a&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=1050) very high VRAM GPU, let's also use --gpu-only&nbsp; and copy it and save. Then it will start the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=1057) backend from this ComfyUI. So it will be super&nbsp; fast. It will be using the latest ComfyUI with&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=1063) all the libraries that we would need. Let's also&nbsp; download some of the models. Let's test out Wan&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=1070) 2.1. So for that, I will use the model installer&nbsp; again. So let's copy this. I had closed it. Let's&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=1077) start again. Okay, it is started. Let's go to the&nbsp; Gradio. Meanwhile, it is loading the backend. When&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=1083) you go to logs and debug, you will see that it is&nbsp; installing the necessary additional libraries for&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=1090) SwarmUI, nothing else. So it will be really fast&nbsp; compared to initial install of the ComfyUI. Then&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=1096) let's go to the bundles and let's download Wan&nbsp; 2.1 core models bundle. This may take a while,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=1103) unfortunately, because of the download speed, but&nbsp; the download has started. This time it is a little&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=1109) bit faster than before. And make sure that your&nbsp; pod is not out of volume. This is where the models&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=1116) will be downloaded. And by default, you see that&nbsp; it has recognized my SwarmUI models folder, so&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=1122) they will be downloaded into the accurate folder.&nbsp; You can also give different folder from the server&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=1128) configuration. You can give your model root. So&nbsp; if you want to use them from another folder, like&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=1133) from the ComfyUI models folder, you can change&nbsp; the root model and it will work. This applies to&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=1138) Windows as well. Everything applies to Windows,&nbsp; Linux, cloud, it is all same. And it is still&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=1144) installing the necessary packages and meanwhile,&nbsp; we are downloading the models. So I really&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=1149) recommend you to download models at the same&nbsp; time as installation on RunPod to save your time.

- [00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=1157) Okay, so the downloads have been completed.&nbsp; You can also see in here and the backend has&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=1162) been loaded. So I am going to use CausVid LoRA&nbsp; with Wan 2.1 and we already have presets. It&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=1169) is inside the SwarmUI model downloader. You will&nbsp; see it when you extract the zip archive. You will&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=1174) see that there are amazing SwarmUI presets.&nbsp; So let's import preset, select the preset,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=1180) import. It is imported. Quick tools, reset&nbsp; params to default, select "Fast CausVid With&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=1186) Image to Video" here. And from models,&nbsp; let's go to models, let's refresh. Okay,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=1192) it is here. Let's use "Image to Video GGUF". By&nbsp; the way, this has downloaded Q6, but on this GPU,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=1198) you can use the FP16 version as well. So since&nbsp; this is a very powerful GPU, and from presets,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=1205) let's uncheck this and direct apply. Everything&nbsp; applied. By the way, this model native resolution&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=1211) is not 640 to 640. Let's edit metadata. It is&nbsp; 960 to 960 like this. Okay, and this is image to&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=1221) video model. Let's generate 81 frames and let's&nbsp; go to the init image. Let's choose file. Okay,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=1227) let's try this dinosaur. Let's make the init&nbsp; image creativity zero, resolution closest aspect&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=1233) ratio. You see, this is the resolution. Okay,&nbsp; I need to check this and uncheck this. Okay,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=1238) like this. Now it is fixed. And yes, we&nbsp; set the resolution. We also need to type&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=1243) a prompt. A running Tyrannosaurus Rex. Okay, like&nbsp; this. And we are ready. So this will generate this&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=1252) video in eight steps. Oh, we have forgotten the&nbsp; LoRA. So let's interrupt all sections. Go to LoRA,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=1258) select this LoRA. Okay, we are now ready. So&nbsp; this will generate this video in eight steps and&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=1265) it should be super fast on this GPU. We are also&nbsp; keeping everything in VRAM. Let's see. pip install&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=1272) nvitop. nvitop. This is a 96 gigabyte&nbsp; VRAM having GPU. We have to wait for model to&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=1279) be loaded. We are also using Sage Attention and we&nbsp; are keeping everything on GPU. So the generation&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=1286) is starting. We could also install frame&nbsp; interpolation as I have shown in the previous&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=1291) tutorials. It is all same. I really recommend you&nbsp; to use SwarmUI if you are not an expert of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=1296) ComfyUI because it is really, really hard and it&nbsp; gets broken. You need to find accurate workflow,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=1303) download all the accurate files. And if you don't&nbsp; know how you can download files to the RunPod,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=1308) just type "SECourses wget" into the YouTube&nbsp; search and you will see this tutorial.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=1313) This tutorial shows you how to use wget command&nbsp; and also amazing Hugging Face upload and download&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=1320) Jupyter Notebook. So I really recommend to watch&nbsp; this tutorial if you want to learn how you can&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=1326) upload and download big files to the RunPod. Okay,&nbsp; it is using 35 gigabytes of VRAM while the entire&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=1334) model is in the GPU. It is generating the video&nbsp; right now in the 720p. So it's an HD resolution.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=1343) Let's see the step speed in a moment. Okay, so the&nbsp; step speed is 16 second / IT on this GPU. It will take&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=1351) less than two minutes to generate this natively HD&nbsp; video. By the way, if we were using FP16 version,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=1359) perhaps it would be faster. So let's also&nbsp; download FP16 Wan 2.1. It is inside the Wan&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=1367) models. So let's turn this off. Let's go to the&nbsp; video generation models, Wan 2.1 models, and I am&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=1374) going to download FP16 image to video here, this&nbsp; one. Okay, let's click the download. Meanwhile,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=1380) it is generating, it will download the model into&nbsp; the accurate folder. It is 32 gigabytes of disk&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=1386) space. Make sure that your pod is not getting&nbsp; out of disk, and we still have space. And it is&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=1392) downloading fast, nice. And we can also see the&nbsp; difference of between two models, but GGUF Q6 is&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=1399) also a great quality model with great precision.&nbsp; So yes, it is now 15 second IT. When you are using&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=1406) CausVid LoRA, you can just use eight steps and you&nbsp; don't need to use Teacache or other optimization&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=1414) with Sage Attention, it works really, really&nbsp; good and fast. And this is natively HD resolution&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=1421) video. Let's also install frame interpolation&nbsp; after this. Okay, it may take a while. Okay,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=1428) it didn't animate greatly this, but let's see&nbsp; the difference with FP16. Maybe this prompt&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=1435) wasn't good enough too. Okay, and let's install&nbsp; frame interpolation. Meanwhile, the FP16 model&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=1441) is getting downloaded. When you install Teacache,&nbsp; it will reload the backends. And when you click&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=1446) "Display Advanced Options", you will see all the&nbsp; settings we set, like here. Okay, FP16 version has&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=1453) been downloaded. We are still waiting backends&nbsp; to be loaded. And by the way, I am also working&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=1459) on another tutorial for Wan 2.1 with VACE, and it&nbsp; will be really great. Let me show you example of&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=1466) VACE. So you see, this was a video I generated by&nbsp; using a dog running as a driving video and using&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=1475) this image. So this is way better compared to some&nbsp; random animation. Okay, backend loaded. So let's&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=1481) change our model. To change our model, we will&nbsp; change it from here, like this. And let's also&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=1487) refresh here, and let's also select the model&nbsp; from here, new downloaded model. Moreover, from&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=1492) the advanced sampling, I will set the precision&nbsp; as 16 bit and let's generate. I wonder how much&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=1500) VRAM it will use now since we will use the FP16&nbsp; model. Okay, let's wait for model to be loaded,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=1507) but it is really, really slow. For some reason,&nbsp; it didn't start, so let's interrupt all sessions.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=1513) Let's also enable RIFE and make it 2x. Okay, it&nbsp; still shows two generations. I think we got a&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=1520) bug at somewhere. So let's refresh. Okay, I think&nbsp; it did refresh. Okay, everything is looking good.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=1527) Let's try again. Okay, it says one generation,&nbsp; one queued. Nice. Let's go to the logs. Sometimes&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=1532) this can happen. And let's see. Okay, now it&nbsp; is loading the model. I can see that. Good. Oh,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=1539) we got an inaccurate resolution because of the&nbsp; metadata of newly downloaded model. But first,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=1546) let's just wait for initial generation or load.&nbsp; This model loading taking forever on RunPod,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=1552) unfortunately. Okay, finally, the model has been&nbsp; loaded. You see it is using 57 gigabytes of VRAM&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=1559) and it is entirely loaded into the GPU. We are not&nbsp; using block swapping or any optimization. This is&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=1566) the highest quality that you can get in terms of&nbsp; the model precision. And let's see if there is a&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=1572) big animation. I think this image and this prompt&nbsp; is not very animatable. Yeah, it is also doing&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=1579) RIFE frame interpolation and it is generated, but&nbsp; the animation is still very limited. Let's disable&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=1588) the CausVid LoRA and let's change the resolution&nbsp; to the accurate. So let's edit metadata and make&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=1595) it properly like this, save. Okay, change model.&nbsp; Yes, it is fixed. We removed the LoRA. Okay,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=1602) there is a prompt. Let's try this one. I&nbsp; wonder how much difference it will make. Okay,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=1606) this prompt also didn't make much difference. As&nbsp; a final step, I am testing with Wan 2.1 image to&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=1613) video. So this is the preset. Just direct apply,&nbsp; and I changed the frame count to 81 and video&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=1620) steps to 50. I'm not using Teacache. So this is&nbsp; the official usage of the Wan 2.1 image to video.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=1628) Let's see if there will be much difference or not.&nbsp; This will take a while, but if this is also same&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=1633) way, not very much animated, that means that this&nbsp; image and this prompt with this model is not much&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=1641) compatible. You need to use Wan 2.1 VACE with a&nbsp; driving video. All right, this generation has made&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=1649) a significantly different video as you are seeing&nbsp; right now. So it is best to install Teacache as in&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=1656) the previous tutorials and use it in that way if&nbsp; your animation is not that great. It's all about&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=1665) some experience, experimentation and testing, and&nbsp; hopefully you will find your very best workflow&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02kPf9Y3_w&t=1670) for your case. If you have any questions, just&nbsp; message me on Patreon, just reply to this video,&nbsp;&nbsp;
