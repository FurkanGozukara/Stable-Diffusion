### Video Transcription


- [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=0) Greetings everyone. Today I am going to show&nbsp; you Wan 2.2 trainings. This will be an epic&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=8) tutorial. I will cover so many topics, so check&nbsp; out the video descriptions to learn all. So,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=14) what I am going to show you today? I will show&nbsp; you how to train Wan 2.2 model to generate&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=22) images like these ones. You see, these are&nbsp; extremely high quality and extremely realistic,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=28) with massive amount of details, textures,&nbsp; amazing quality, and amazing realism. The&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=35) Wan 2.2 is currently the most realistic plus&nbsp; most advanced model for generating images.

- [00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=44) But I will not show only how to train images.&nbsp; I will show also how to generate videos,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=50) how to train video model, so many things. I&nbsp; will show how to train on your local computer&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=56) with our SECourses Musubi Tuner application.&nbsp; I have prepared configurations for every GPU,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=64) starting from 6 GB GPUs to 192 GB GPUs. The&nbsp; configurations are all set. They are separated&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=72) into qualities, so you can pick your configuration&nbsp; according to your GPU and start training right&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=79) away and get the most amazing results without&nbsp; doing all the research that I did for you.

- [00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=85) I have literally done over 64 separate&nbsp; trainings to find out the best workflow,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=93) find out the best parameters, and prepare these&nbsp; presets. I have used a cloud machine with 8 B200&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=101) GPUs to complete these trainings, analyze them.&nbsp; Moreover, I have developed this Gradio based&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=106) application that you will be able to load the&nbsp; configuration and start training right away.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=112) Furthermore, I will show how to do training on&nbsp; RunPod. So if you don't have a powerful GPU,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=117) you will be able to train on RunPod. And I will&nbsp; show how to do training on Massed Compute. Again,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=122) if you don't have a powerful GPU, you will be&nbsp; able to train on Massed Compute. For example,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=127) you see with this GPU we are able to train with&nbsp; like 70 minutes with only 2 dollars in 1 hour.

- [00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=134) Everything is ready. Some people were asking&nbsp; me how to train on RunPod and Massed Compute&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=139) the Qwen image models. This tutorial&nbsp; covers the Wan 2.2 training. However,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=145) all of the models that we support in SECourses&nbsp; Musubi Tuner are exactly same. So you can train&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=151) the Qwen image models, Wan models, or the future&nbsp; models hopefully that will get added like Flux 2,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=157) like Z Image base model, will be&nbsp; exactly same as in this tutorial.

- [00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=162) Moreover, I have updated all of our presets&nbsp; to the highest quality with lowest amount of&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=169) time to generate highest quality images and&nbsp; videos. So all the image generation and video&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=176) generation presets are updated and ready&nbsp; for you to use. To update these presets,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=181) I have done so many different tests. I have&nbsp; compared all the results of these tests to&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=188) generate videos or images. So many tests have&nbsp; been made. This tutorial is a product of a massive&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=195) research. So many different parameter testing, so&nbsp; many different workflow testing, and all is ready&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=200) for you to use right away with 1 click installers.&nbsp; So you see from bad videos to good videos.

- [00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=206) This tutorial covers text to image&nbsp; training with only from images,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=210) text to video training with only images or&nbsp; plus videos, but videos are not necessary,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=216) or image to video training. I have done so many&nbsp; testing and training only text to video yields the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=223) best results for text to video generation or image&nbsp; to video generation. The presets are separated,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=229) so if you are not interested in video generation,&nbsp; you can only use the text to image generation&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=235) workflow. Still, it is working on text to video&nbsp; generation or image to video generation as well.

- [00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=241) So all these configs are interchangeable. There&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=244) are several tricks. If you want to&nbsp; generate highest quality images,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=248) you use the text to image configs. If you&nbsp; want to generate highest quality videos,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=253) you use Wan 2.2 text to video configs. If you want&nbsp; to generate image to video, still I recommend to&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=260) use text to video configs because this is working&nbsp; better than image to video. It is weird, I know,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=265) but this is my findings. How do I know? Because&nbsp; I have done so many different testings as you&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=272) are seeing. This is a research of a week doing&nbsp; a lot of comparisons, doing a lot of testing,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=278) experimentation, and all the presets are ready for&nbsp; you to use right away with the highest quality.

- [00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=285) So I will show everything: how to install, how&nbsp; to set up, how to start training both Windows,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=291) RunPod, Massed Compute. And everything is&nbsp; literally with 1 click install. Let's begin.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=296) So as usual, I have prepared an amazing post&nbsp; where you will find everything to follow this&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=302) tutorial. However, before starting this tutorial,&nbsp; you need to watch this main tutorial. So open&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=308) this tutorial. This tutorial is our Qwen image&nbsp; models training tutorial. This is a masterpiece.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=316) This tutorial covers so many different topics&nbsp; as you are seeing right now. So I recommend&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=322) you to watch this tutorial and learn how to use&nbsp; SECourses Kohya Musubi Tuner premium application.

- [00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=330) So I will download the latest zip file. This&nbsp; zip file includes our latest installers and&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=336) configurations. I will move it into my existing&nbsp; installation folder. Then I will extract the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=343) files here and I will overwrite existing&nbsp; files. Don't forget that you can also do a&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=348) fresh installation. After extraction, double&nbsp; click Windows install and update.bat file.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=355) This will update the application to the latest&nbsp; version. Moreover, now we are using uv package&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=361) installer along with pip, therefore it is ultra&nbsp; fast. So you see my update already completed.

- [00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=368) Then double click Windows download training&nbsp; models.bat file. This file will ask you download&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=374) which training models. For this tutorial, we need&nbsp; Wan 2.2 text to video training. If you want to&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=381) train Wan 2.2 image to video, then you need to&nbsp; download it with option 5. Since I already have&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=387) downloaded the models, it will just verify their&nbsp; hash values, and once the verification completed,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=393) we will be ready. This way we are ensuring&nbsp; that our models are 100 percentage accurately&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=399) downloaded, so we will never have any weird bugs,&nbsp; issues, or problems. If the files were missing,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=406) it would have downloaded them with the maximum&nbsp; speed with your network connection support.

- [00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=411) So now we are ready to begin training. I will&nbsp; double click Windows start up.bat file. This&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=418) will start the latest version of the SECourses&nbsp; Kohya Musubi Tuner premium application. You see&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=425) currently we are at the version 24. This is&nbsp; where you see the versioning. Then go to Wan&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=431) models training. So we are going to use this&nbsp; tab. Whenever you are going to reload a model,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=436) I recommend to refresh, go to the accurate tab,&nbsp; and then begin loading. Then click this icon&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=443) and go back to your installation folder, enter&nbsp; inside Wan 2.2 training configs. Now there are&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=449) 3 configuration folders: Wan 2.2 image to video,&nbsp; Wan 2.2 text to image, and Wan 2.2 text to video.

- [00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=457) So what are the differences between these 3? From&nbsp; the naming as you can see, Wan 2.2 image to video&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=464) trains image to video model. However, there&nbsp; is only single configuration because if you&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=469) want to only generate images, it is not the&nbsp; model that you need. This model is for only&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=474) generating videos. However, I don't recommend to&nbsp; use this model for training even if you are going&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=479) to use image to video models because training&nbsp; with Wan 2.2 text to video works better than&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=486) training with Wan 2.2 image to video, even&nbsp; for image to video presets. Even for image&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=493) to video generation. So for video generation, I&nbsp; recommend to always use Wan 2.2 text to video,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=500) and for only image generation, I&nbsp; recommend to use Wan 2.2 text to image.

- [00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=504) So let's begin with Wan 2.2 text to image. Now&nbsp; you will see bunch of configurations like this.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=510) The first numbers are for GPU&nbsp; VRAM. So if you have 6 GB of GPU,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=516) you need to pick it. If you have 24 GB of GPU,&nbsp; then you need to pick it. It also shows the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=522) quality. The quality 1 is the maximum quality.&nbsp; Then the quality as the number increases the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=528) quality get worse. So quality 1 is better than&nbsp; quality 2, quality 2 better than quality 3,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=534) and so on. Since I have RTX 5090, I am going&nbsp; to use 32 GB VRAM configuration. However,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=542) you will see that there are 2 versions: 32&nbsp; GB of FP8 scaled and no FP8 scaled. The FP8&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=549) scaled has a big advantage. It is usually faster&nbsp; because it uses lesser VRAM. Moreover, it uses&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=556) much lesser RAM memory. So if your RAM memory is&nbsp; limited, then always go with FP8 scaled version.

- [00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=563) So let's open nvitop to see our GPU and RAM&nbsp; memory. pip install nvitop. nvitop. And this is&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=573) my current usages. So I have 60 GB of empty RAM&nbsp; memory. My first GPU is fully empty. Therefore,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=582) I will pick the very best configuration inside&nbsp; Wan 2.2 trainings. Wan 2.2 text to image 32 GB.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=590) And it is loaded. You can also click this icon&nbsp; to be sure it is loaded. Then it is same as in&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=597) our Qwen image training tutorial. What I am&nbsp; going to change here is the training dataset.

- [00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=602) For text to image training, you only need to use&nbsp; the images. For text to video training, if you&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=609) only use images, it is still working perfect as&nbsp; I have shown in the beginning of the tutorial.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=615) But you can also include videos. I will show&nbsp; that later. So I will pick my training dataset,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=621) but first let's prepare it. This is exactly same&nbsp; logic as in the Qwen images, so this is my folder.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=628) I will delete the other files to show you what&nbsp; happens as a quick rewinding. But watch the Qwen&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=635) image training tutorial. So this is my trigger&nbsp; word ohwx and this is my parent path. Don't worry,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=642) it will automatically resize them. So this is&nbsp; it. I copy pasted, I can also pick from here.

- [00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=648) The best working resolution is 960 to 960.&nbsp; How do I know? I have literally tested so&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=656) many different configurations. So when you&nbsp; see these configurations 1024, 1280, 1328,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=665) these are the resolutions that I have tested.&nbsp; And the best yielding resolution is 960 to 960.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=672) Therefore, I recommend that. Then don't forget&nbsp; to click generate dataset configuration and&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=677) it is ready. So when you return back to your&nbsp; images folder, you should see the txt files.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=683) These are the captions and when you open&nbsp; one of them you will see only the folder&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=687) name is used. If you want to use custom&nbsp; captions, you need to change these files.

- [00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=692) Okay, our training dataset is ready. Now we need&nbsp; to set our output and other stuff same as in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=698) Qwen image training tutorial. So I will save&nbsp; them into my test trainings folder like this&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=704) where the models will be saved. This is the model&nbsp; LoRA models file names. Currently fine tuning is&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=710) not supported so we can only train LoRA. Okay,&nbsp; then the model settings. You need to pick the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=715) files for text to image training, we are only use&nbsp; the low noise. There are 2 versions of Wan 2.2:&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=722) high noise and low noise. High noise is the&nbsp; initial generation which roughly generates&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=728) the base of the image or video. The low noise&nbsp; is the details. For generating only images,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=734) we are only using low noise. This is the higher&nbsp; quality. So I will pick the accurate models from&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=741) downloaded models training models Wan. So&nbsp; this is the low noise text to video model.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=747) Like this. Then since other files are there, I&nbsp; will just copy paste the folder paths like this,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=754) like this. But you can individually pick them.&nbsp; We are not going to use Clip Vision, this is not&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=758) used for Wan 2.2 training. And you see there is&nbsp; high noise. This is used for dual model training&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=764) which I will explain after this. So you don't need&nbsp; to change anything else here. Don't change them.

- [00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=770) In the training settings, you need to set your&nbsp; training epochs as I have explained. Since I&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=775) have 28 images, I am going to use 200 epochs. If&nbsp; you have 100 images, then you can reduce this to&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=782) 100. That is the logic. But up to 50 images, I&nbsp; recommend to train at least 200 epochs. Moreover,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=788) there is save every N epochs. So we are saving&nbsp; every 20 epochs. It will save 10 checkpoints that&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=795) I can compare later. Then don't forget to save&nbsp; your configuration. So let's save this as like&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=802) this. LoRA tutorial text to image TOML. Okay, I&nbsp; will save it. Then I will click start training.

- [00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=810) Then follow the CMD window. If you get&nbsp; any errors, you need to report me that.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=816) So currently I have an error. Let's see where we&nbsp; have the error. Maybe we forgot something. Yes,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=821) I have forgotten the VAE path. This can happen.&nbsp; So let's open all the panels like this and&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=829) search for VAE. Okay, the VAE is set here.&nbsp; Okay, I can see the error that I have made,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=835) so I need to fix it. It will be like this. And&nbsp; this is also error. Okay, it will be like this.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=840) So pay attention to the model paths save. You can&nbsp; use the folder icon start training. And you see&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=847) we are also supporting torch compile. I am using&nbsp; your Visual Studio installation automatically.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=854) Therefore, it is super important for you to&nbsp; follow the requirements tutorial which you&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=860) must. So the requirements tutorial are listed&nbsp; here in the post. Follow this requirements&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=866) tutorial first. When you follow the Qwen image&nbsp; models training, you will know this already.

- [00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=871) Okay, let's follow our training. So now&nbsp; it is loading model into the RAM memory,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=876) then it will load into the GPU memory. If you&nbsp; don't have sufficient amount of RAM memory,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=882) training both models, both low and high noise,&nbsp; is harder. And it is even not mandatory. You can&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=888) also train only low noise model and even generate&nbsp; videos. It will be a little bit lower quality,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=895) but it will work. Don't worry. So the training&nbsp; is about to start. Yes, training starting. Okay,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=901) training started. It is not using my entire GPU&nbsp; memory. This is good. You need to have some free&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=907) memory. You will also see that your VRAM usage&nbsp; is not static like this. This is because how&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=912) Kohya developed the Wan 2.2 model training. It&nbsp; clears the VRAM cache after every step because&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=919) it is designed to be work with both models at&nbsp; the same time during training. So the speed&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=925) is around 5 seconds per IT. It will get a little&nbsp; bit slower. This is how Kohya displays currently.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=931) But it is pretty decent. It is taking like 8&nbsp; hours on my GPU. If I need faster training,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=937) then I can reduce the resolution or I can increase&nbsp; the learning rate and I can do lesser epoch. So&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=944) let's say you want 100 epochs, then you need to&nbsp; multiply your learning rate with 2.5 and reduce&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=951) the maximum epochs number. However, you will&nbsp; lose some quality. So this set learning rate&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=958) and number of epochs are the best overall. It is&nbsp; a choice. It is a trade off. Either you need to&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=964) reduce the resolution to speed up or you need to&nbsp; lower the epoch count and increase your learning&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=972) rate. So this will train text to image LoRAs for&nbsp; us which you can use for text to video as well.

- [00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=978) How we are going to use the trained models?&nbsp; I will stop the training. So for using the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=983) trained models, we are going to use SwarmUI. The&nbsp; SwarmUI link is here. So let's also proceed with&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=989) it. If you don't know how to use SwarmUI&nbsp; already, you need to follow this tutorial.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=994) You see this is the tutorial link in&nbsp; the top of the post. When you open it,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=1000) copy the zip file there. So let's download the&nbsp; latest zip file from here. Then I will move it&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=1006) into my existing SwarmUI installation like this.&nbsp; Copy the file there. Right click and extract files&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=1014) here and overwrite all. Then as a next step, we&nbsp; will update our ComfyUI installation. So go to&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=1020) ComfyUI link from here. Download the latest&nbsp; zip file. You see there are 2 versions with&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=1026) password protected one. If your antivirus, this&nbsp; happens with Windows Defender, causes issues,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=1033) download with the password protected, then move&nbsp; your ComfyUI zip file into your folder or you can&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=1039) make a fresh installation. As usual, make an file&nbsp; extraction overwrite all files. Then to update or&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=1047) install Windows install or update comfyui.bat&nbsp; file. We have moved the installation to uv&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=1054) packages. So now it is much faster than before.&nbsp; Both update and installation. So you see it is&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=1060) all updated. Then return back to your SwarmUI. In&nbsp; the SwarmUI, we have Windows update swarmui. So&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=1068) double click it run. It will update SwarmUI and&nbsp; start your application. Everything was already&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=1074) explained in other tutorials in more details,&nbsp; so you should watch them. Okay, SwarmUI update&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=1080) succeed and it started. You will also get this&nbsp; error. This is not important, just ignore that.

- [00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=1086) First of all, you need to get the latest presets.&nbsp; So you can use import, choose file, go back to&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=1093) your SwarmUI installation and select the latest&nbsp; preset from here. Then overwrite existing presets.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=1100) Alternatively, while the application is running,&nbsp; you can use the preset delete import. This will&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=1106) delete your existing presets and just refresh it.&nbsp; Then click refresh and everything is here. The&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=1113) presets are important because I have updated the&nbsp; presets for video generation for Wan 2.2 and also&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=1120) image generation. So use the latest presets. Now&nbsp; how we are going to use our trained Wan 2.2 image&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=1128) generation LoRAs. So first of all, quick tools&nbsp; reset params to default. Then from the presets,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=1133) the preset that you need to use is Wan 2.2&nbsp; generate realistic images. Click here and&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=1138) direct apply. This will let you generate 960&nbsp; to 960 images. So let's type our prompt. Select&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=1147) your aspect ratio whichever you want. For example,&nbsp; this one. And then you need to select your LoRA.

- [00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=1154) But there is one more thing. You need to have&nbsp; models downloaded for this preset to work. So&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=1159) how you are going to download accurate models?&nbsp; You see Windows start download models app.bat&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=1165) file. This will start the model downloader&nbsp; latest version. We have upgraded this. Also&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=1170) it is using uv package. So now it is even faster&nbsp; to start. Okay, the downloader started. So which&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=1177) models you need to download? You can download&nbsp; complete image generation and editing bundle.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=1182) Or you can download Wan 2.2 core 4 steps&nbsp; bundle. This is my recommended bundle. So&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=1189) go to bottom and download all models inside&nbsp; this bundle. This way you will have all the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=1196) models that you need. Even the upscaler models&nbsp; that you need to use to get maximum quality.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=1203) You can follow the download process from the&nbsp; CMD window. So if I am missing any models,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=1209) they will get downloaded. If I already have some&nbsp; models, they will be verified and it will skip&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=1214) the download. So currently it is downloading&nbsp; some of my missing models, but I have the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=1219) necessary models for image generation which is&nbsp; Wan 2.2 text to video low noise. So it is set.

- [00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=1226) Now I need to set my LoRA. So these are the LoRAs&nbsp; that it finds. It is compatible with Wan 2.2. My&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=1233) trained LoRA is inside here. Wan 2.2 low noise.&nbsp; This is my trained LoRA. This is 200 epochs&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=1242) training results. As in the Qwen image training&nbsp; tutorial, you should compare your checkpoints&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=1247) with grid system and verify which model,&nbsp; which checkpoint is the best. Like 20 epochs,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=1254) 40 epochs, 60, 80. So this is 200 epochs. And&nbsp; let's generate 4 random images. Currently this&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=1261) is using our ComfyUI installation. It&nbsp; was updated. It is using Sage Attention,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=1267) my first GPU. Everything was previously&nbsp; explained in other tutorials. Moreover,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=1272) you should follow your VRAM usage from nvitop&nbsp; to see what is happening. I have the sufficient&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=1277) amount of RAM memory and VRAM. If your GPU&nbsp; is weak like 6 GB GPU, don't worry. Since&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=1283) we are using the ComfyUI, it is automatically&nbsp; doing block swapping and also CPU offloading,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=1289) RAM offloading. Therefore, no matter what GPU&nbsp; you have, it will work. This is the beauty of&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=1295) the SwarmUI with ComfyUI backend. So it is&nbsp; doing all the optimizations that you need.

- [00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=1301) The image generation in the base resolution will&nbsp; be pretty fast as you are seeing right now. Okay,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=1306) this was the first image. The face is not that&nbsp; great. We should do either face inpainting or&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=1311) we are going to do upscaling which I will show&nbsp; in a moment. However, this took only 45 seconds.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=1318) You can also reduce the number of steps if you&nbsp; want. But this model is not a small model. This&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=1324) is a big model. 14 billion parameters. This&nbsp; model is much more powerful than the Z Image&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=1331) turbo model if you ask my opinion. Okay, this is&nbsp; another image. So generate few images like this.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=1336) Okay. Let's say I liked this image. So I will&nbsp; click reuse parameters. It will set its seed.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=1342) Then I will go to presets and I will apply the our&nbsp; upscale. You see there is 2x upscale direct apply.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=1350) And I will regenerate. Let's see the difference.&nbsp; Furthermore, you can change the base resolution&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=1356) of this model. Up to 1280 to 1280. 1280 to 1280.&nbsp; This model is able to generate images. Sometimes&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=1366) it may add some hallucinations to the right and&nbsp; left border. But you can increase the resolution,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=1372) the base resolution to 1280 to 1280. I will&nbsp; show after this how to do that. But let's&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=1379) see the upscaled result. So as a reminding, let&nbsp; me remind you where you put your trained LoRAs.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=1384) They are put inside SwarmUI inside models inside&nbsp; LoRA folder. This is where you need to put your&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=1390) trained LoRAs. Inside LoRA folder. Okay, now&nbsp; it is upscaling. The upscaling will take more&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=1395) time obviously because we are doubling the image&nbsp; resolution. So as I said, don't worry if you don't&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=1402) have a powerful GPU, it will still work with&nbsp; automatic block swapping and CPU offloading.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=1408) Everything will be handled by the ComfyUI.&nbsp; No matter what GPU you have, it will work.

- [00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=1413) And here it is. So let's make a comparison.&nbsp; This was the base image. You see this was the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=1418) base image. Then this is the upscaled image.&nbsp; As you can see, it fixed the face. It added&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=1424) huge amount of details, quality. There is a&nbsp; significant difference between the base image&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=1430) and the generated upscaled image. Again, as I&nbsp; said, you can increase the base resolution even&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=1438) up to actually 1920 to 1080. However, it may add&nbsp; some hallucinations. Let's try this and to see&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=1446) the difference. But in my experimentation what I&nbsp; did was I selected my model which is low noise.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=1454) So here low noise. So click this hamburger menu,&nbsp; edit metadata, and change this to 1280 1280. Okay,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=1463) like this. Save. Then select another model and&nbsp; select your model. It will update resolutions&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=1469) accordingly. So when you select your aspect ratio&nbsp; now, it will set it accordingly to 1280 to 1280&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=1477) base resolution. These are all optional. You can&nbsp; do whichever you want. And generate another image&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=1483) with 1280 to 1280 total resolution. The aspect&nbsp; ratio is like this. But let's see also 1920 to&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=1491) 1080 result as well. Okay. Yeah, not bad.&nbsp; Not as good as upscale but not bad at all.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=1498) Now with this 1280 to 1280 base resolution, if I&nbsp; also do upscale which I did in the example images,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=1507) it will become much better. For example, let&nbsp; me show you from the history row and Wan 2.2.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=1515) I have shown in the beginning of the tutorial but&nbsp; let's see again. So you see these images are huge,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=1521) massive. If I open, this is 3360 to 1920 pixels.&nbsp; Therefore, it has huge amount of details. I mean&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=1534) look at these details. So you can generate&nbsp; massive images as well with this strategy.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=1540) Set the base resolution and upscale. Okay, this&nbsp; is 1280 to 1280. Now I will reuse parameters&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=1546) and enable my upscale preset one more time. It&nbsp; is here direct apply and generate. Now it will&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=1553) upscale this image into twice resolution.&nbsp; Of course, it will take time. However,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=1558) it will be the maximum quality. So this image&nbsp; full HD was generated in 73 seconds. This image&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=1567) 1280 to 1280 was generated in 55 seconds. This&nbsp; big image was generated in 2 minute 25 seconds.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=1576) I mean these are the expected times because&nbsp; we are generating really high quality images,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=1581) really high resolution images with perfect&nbsp; accuracy. And this is literally the first&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=1586) generation that we did. So I can generate&nbsp; more and pick the better ones and as you&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=1590) do more generations you will understand&nbsp; how the model works, what are the basics.

- [00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=1595) Okay, so the upscale of the 1280 to 1280&nbsp; completed and let's look at the difference&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=1601) one more time. So this is upscaled and&nbsp; this was the base. So from this base,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=1607) we upscaled into this masterpiece. The&nbsp; resolution is just amazing. The details,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=1613) the realism, everything is mind blowing compared&nbsp; to the other models. So can you use this model,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=1621) this only images trained low noise model&nbsp; for video generation? Yes. It will be&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=1627) a little bit lower quality, but yes. Let me&nbsp; demonstrate that. So I will copy this prompt.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=1633) You can also use this for image to video as well,&nbsp; don't worry. Everything is same. So let's refresh.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=1639) Reset params to default. And there are several&nbsp; options that you can use. For the highest quality,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=1646) you need to use Wan 2.2 high quality text to video&nbsp; 20 steps. This will take some time. On my GPU it&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=1654) takes like 6 to 7 minutes. Or you can use the&nbsp; lightning LoRA based one. You see Wan 2.2 text to&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=1661) video. So let's see the lightning LoRA first, then&nbsp; let's see the other one. Then let's proceed to&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=1667) dual model training. So direct apply. You see it&nbsp; is going to set the low and high noise LoRAs like&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=1674) this automatically for you. Copy paste your prompt&nbsp; and select your trained LoRA. So this was the low&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=1680) noise LoRA. Then generate. This will be pretty&nbsp; fast because it is only total 4 steps. And again,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=1689) for this preset to work flawlessly, you need to&nbsp; download this bundle. Or you will be having issues&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=1696) with the models finding them, setting them.&nbsp; I am doing everything automatically for you.

- [00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=1701) Okay, so the generation started. First it is&nbsp; starting to use the high noise Wan 2.2 model.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=1708) Then it will use the low noise model. However,&nbsp; we should change the prompt to into a video&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=1715) of. So it will be a little bit better. When you&nbsp; switch presets like this, since your base model&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=1721) will change, it will take some time for loading&nbsp; reloading models, but everything is automatically&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=1726) and properly made by the ComfyUI. So you shouldn't&nbsp; have any problems. And as you can see, it is able&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=1734) to 100 percentage utilize my GPU. It is using&nbsp; my GPU 575 watts at once. So it is maximum power&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=1745) usage. Okay, it is starting to generate. Since&nbsp; we trained our LoRA only on low noise model, this&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=1752) will work a little bit lower quality than training&nbsp; on dual models which I will show. However,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=1758) you can use this LoRA on image to video presets&nbsp; as well. I will show that too after this. Okay,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=1764) so the video has been generated. Let's see&nbsp; the video. Yes, I can see the resemblance&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=1770) and accuracy. It is pretty good as you can&nbsp; see. This is base video. If I upscale it,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=1775) it would be better, but I can certainly see the&nbsp; resemblance especially as it gets closer. Let me&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=1782) show you the final frame perhaps like this. And&nbsp; it only took how many minutes. It only took 111&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=1789) seconds. So it takes lesser than 2 minutes. If I&nbsp; want better quality, then I need to switch to this&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=1796) preset. This will do real 20 steps with real&nbsp; CFG scale and it will be much higher quality.

- [00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=1804) What about using this on image to video. Can I do&nbsp; that? Yes. So I will do reset params to default.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=1812) Go to presets. With image to video again we have 2&nbsp; quality presets. You can use this high quality or&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=1820) you can use Wan 2.2 image to video 4 steps. This&nbsp; is also really good quality. So direct apply. Then&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=1827) let's select our prompt like this. I don't need&nbsp; to copy this of course this time. Just copy paste&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=1833) the prompt. Then as an image for example let's use&nbsp; this image. So I will go to init image choose file&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=1841) then choose this then resolution close use closest&nbsp; aspect ratio. And the preset was not selected.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=1848) Yes, I need to select the preset so refresh. Reset&nbsp; params to default. Then refresh models to be sure&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=1855) you have everything. Then presets and let's go&nbsp; to presets. Okay this one direct apply. Yes,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=1862) you see it has selected the accurate model. This&nbsp; is important apply. Then let's go to init image&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=1868) choose file select our photo closest aspect ratio.&nbsp; Okay. Now I also need to select my LoRA. So my&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=1875) LoRA was let's see this one. This is only trained&nbsp; with the images on low noise and generate. This is&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=1884) also 4 steps. So therefore it will be pretty good.&nbsp; However, since we are switching a lot of models,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=1890) it may leave some left over. Therefore what&nbsp; I am going to do is I will cancel this first.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=1895) Then server backend and restart all backends.&nbsp; This will refresh my memory usages like this.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=1903) You see it cleared everything. If you are going to&nbsp; do a lot of model switching, you can restart your&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=1908) backend to clear your VRAM and RAM memory and then&nbsp; generate. Now it should work better. Otherwise you&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=1916) need to trust the ComfyUI RAM management. So I&nbsp; recommend to restart backends when you are going&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=1921) to do big models switching like this. Because&nbsp; we switched from LoRA text to video to image&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=1928) to video. Okay, it is nice. It is loading into RAM&nbsp; then starting generation. This should be also take&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=1935) lesser than 2 minutes especially the second and&nbsp; third generations. By the way this was an image&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=1941) prompt. Therefore for video prompting you need&nbsp; to do better. But I am just showing an example.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=1948) So this prompt is not made for video generation.&nbsp; This was made for image generation. Therefore it&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=1955) may not be perfect for video generation. However&nbsp; still we should see the you know the quality and&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=1962) video. I have tested that training text to&nbsp; video model LoRA improves image to video as&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=1969) well. Training image to video LoRA doesn't improve&nbsp; that well. It is weird I know. Maybe it is because&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=1975) I have trained with only images static images&nbsp; not with videos. But this is really improving&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=1980) image to video as well. So you can train an image&nbsp; LoRA from text to video model with just images and&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=1987) it will improve your image to video generations&nbsp; as well. Okay, it failed for some reason maybe.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=1994) Let's see the logs. No I don't see any error.&nbsp; Why it is showing an error. Okay, I think I&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=2001) was out of RAM memory so the ComfyUI crashed&nbsp; probably because I am already using 2 GPUs.

- [00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=2009) RAM memory on my computer with all other stuff&nbsp; that is open. Okay, it crashed again due to out of&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=2017) RAM memory. Therefore, I have added this argument:&nbsp; --cache-none. When you add this into your backend,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=2025) it will cache none of the models. So this is&nbsp; really useful when you are working with Wan 2.2&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=2032) low and high noise models together at the same&nbsp; time if you don't have sufficient amount of RAM&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=2038) memory, especially system RAM memory. So this&nbsp; way, it will use a model, generate, it will&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=2044) then offload it, completely deleted, and load the&nbsp; next model. This will minimize your RAM usage,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=2051) also VRAM usage, with delay of loading models&nbsp; from the disk. But since my disks are fast,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=2058) it is not an issue. So it fixed the&nbsp; issue. There is no more RAM leakage&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=2063) or RAM accumulation and we are about to&nbsp; get the video ready. It is pretty fast.

- [00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=2070) Okay, we got the video. So this was from image&nbsp; to video. As we get, you know, distant from the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=2077) camera, the resemblance gets decreased, but&nbsp; this was only static images trained model,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=2084) not the auto model. However, it is decent&nbsp; and it took only 2.4 minutes generation. So,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=2092) how we are going to train on dual models?&nbsp; Not only with the single model. If you want&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=2098) to generate videos, this is what you should do.&nbsp; So I will just disable my backend to minimize my&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=2104) VRAM usage. Then go back to your SECourses&nbsp; Musubi Tuner. So for dual model training,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=2113) we are just going to change our preset. So I will&nbsp; open a new tab here. Go to 1 Models Training,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=2120) open folder. Go back to Wan 2.2 training&nbsp; configurations. So we are going to use&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=2124) text to video configs. These configurations train&nbsp; both high noise and low noise models at the same&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=2132) time. However, this will use more VRAM and this&nbsp; will use more RAM memory since you need to have&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=2138) both of the models loaded into your RAM memory.&nbsp; Therefore, be careful. I recommend to begin with&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=2145) fp8 scaled versions. Then once you verified it&nbsp; is working, you can move to non-fp8. So let's&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=2152) begin with fp8 scaled. Again, always save your&nbsp; configurations like this. Then we need to set&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=2160) the output directory. Don't forget that. So&nbsp; I can just copy paste the directories here.

- [00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=2167) Training dataset. Again, I am only using static&nbsp; images. If you use videos, the videos will use&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=2173) more VRAM memory. Therefore, be very careful.&nbsp; If you use videos, then you need to have more&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=2180) VRAM memory, RAM memory. You need to do more&nbsp; block swapping. You may need to reduce your&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=2185) training resolution. Everything changes. So first,&nbsp; train with only static images, verify results,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=2193) get some results, get some test done, then you can&nbsp; include videos into your training dataset. You can&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=2199) have multiple subfolders for different training&nbsp; datasets and for each dataset have different&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=2207) resolutions. So let me demonstrate an example.&nbsp; So what I did is I generated another folder like&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=2214) this, 1_ohwx_video. However, I will be needed&nbsp; to set different captions, not automatic ones.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=2220) So I will copy paste it here. As I said, first I&nbsp; recommend to train with only static images then&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=2226) include videos. But I will show how to include&nbsp; videos. And generate dataset configuration. Now,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=2233) it will generate datasets like this. You need to&nbsp; edit this TOML file. Why? Because you will see&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=2242) that it is using the same resolution for both&nbsp; images and videos. What does this mean? This&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=2248) means that if your images are high resolution,&nbsp; the videos will be too high resolution. Either&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=2252) you need to auto downscale your videos to lower&nbsp; resolution or you need to edit this TOML file.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=2260) So I will open this TOML file. It is saved&nbsp; inside this folder. You need to do this manually.

- [00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=2267) So this is the generated TOML file. You can see&nbsp; that there are 2 different datasets. The first&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=2273) one is the image dataset and the second one is&nbsp; the video dataset. And in the video dataset,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=2278) it is going to use some frame extraction method&nbsp; and it is going to use some methods like frame&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=2283) extraction head, target frames, number of repeats,&nbsp; max frames. So I am going to set resolution here&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=2289) as well and change the resolution like 480 to&nbsp; 480. So that it will use this resolution for&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=2297) this dataset. You can also change the resolution&nbsp; of the image dataset from here. So you can have&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=2303) different dataset resolutions. And if you are&nbsp; wondering what are these other options for&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=2308) video datasets, it is all written here with&nbsp; details. When you scroll down, you will see&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=2313) dataset preparation details. Open this and read&nbsp; here. However, as I said multiple times now,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=2321) train with only images then verify your results&nbsp; then do training with video dataset. Moreover,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=2329) now since we have 2 different folders, you will&nbsp; see that it generated the captions like this&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=2334) for the video dataset. So you need to change the&nbsp; caption of the video as well. I didn't test this.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=2341) Probably this will work best with just trigger&nbsp; word or you can describe the video action as&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=2347) well in these captions. However, for using the&nbsp; static images, I recommend only trigger word&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=2353) as a caption. So I will delete this and I will&nbsp; regenerate dataset configuration. Yes. Now it will&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=2360) use only my images dataset. It shows 56 double&nbsp; times but it is okay. There is actually 28 images.

- [00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=2367) Okay, we did set the dataset. This is&nbsp; how you prepare your video training&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=2372) datasets. Then we set the other things same&nbsp; as the previous training. So in the models,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=2379) I will just copy paste the paths here, here,&nbsp; here. And additionally, for this model,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=2386) you need to set the high noise model as well. So&nbsp; it is here. So I will set it like this. You see,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=2393) high noise. And that's it. Now I will save my&nbsp; configuration and click training. It should&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=2401) start and work right away. However, you need&nbsp; to have more RAM memory for this to work and it&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=2408) will use a little bit more VRAM memory as well.&nbsp; So let's see what happens. The training window&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=2415) is here. You will see that it will load both low&nbsp; noise and high noise models into the your system.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=2424) You should see them in the CMD window. So first&nbsp; it is loading the low noise then it is loading&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=2430) the high noise. Low noise is for details,&nbsp; high noise is for the initial generation,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=2435) the base structure. We train only low noise for&nbsp; image generation. However, if you want to generate&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=2442) videos, you should train on both of them. You can&nbsp; also train them individually one by one. However,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=2448) its quality is lower than training this dual&nbsp; model configuration. So you can load the image&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=2454) configuration, image training configuration,&nbsp; change low noise model to high noise model. It&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=2459) will work exactly same and train high noise&nbsp; model. If your system is not able to train&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=2465) both models at the same time, you can follow&nbsp; that strategy. But what I recommend is rent&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=2471) a machine from the RunPod or Massed Compute&nbsp; which I will show and train there and use.

- [00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=2476) Okay, it started. As you can see, both of the&nbsp; models is running at the same time now. You will&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=2483) see that it will fluctuate the VRAM usage and how&nbsp; it changes model is like 87 percent. Okay, you see&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=2491) the RAM usage increased because now it is loading&nbsp; the other model and it is switching between them.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=2497) Okay, you see. It is working nice. It is using&nbsp; almost my entire RAM memory right now so I should&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=2503) decrease my RAM memory usage. I can also reduce my&nbsp; block swap count because I still have some VRAM.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=2510) So where you increase or decrease the block swap?&nbsp; So let's open all panels, search for swap and&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=2517) you will see that there is block swap. So you can&nbsp; change block swaps. Currently since it is fitting&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=2524) into my VRAM entirely with fp8 scaled, I am not&nbsp; doing any block swap. But if it doesn't fit in&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=2530) your case, you need to increase this like 10, 20,&nbsp; 15. Moreover, I can use offload inactive DiT to&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=2538) CPU. This requires more RAM memory and it is not&nbsp; compatible with blocks to swap. So when you do&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=2544) block swap, you cannot use this unfortunately.&nbsp; Therefore, it is the fastest training that I&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=2550) can get right now. Its speed is very good as&nbsp; you can see. It is also faster than training&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=2554) only image model right now because I am doing fp8&nbsp; scaled training. If I were doing not fp8 scaling,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=2561) I would be needed to do block swapping and block&nbsp; swapping reduces your speed. So this dual model&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=2567) training takes like 6 hours on my GPU, maybe&nbsp; even faster. This is how you train dual model.

- [00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=2574) And how you use dual model? Exactly same as the&nbsp; single image training. I only change my LoRA to&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=2581) use it. So let's enable back our backend and let's&nbsp; open a new tab. Copy our prompt. Quick tools,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=2590) reset params to default presets. And let's use&nbsp; this high quality preset this time. Direct apply.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=2596) Type our prompt like this. Okay. Make sure to&nbsp; not include the LoRAs in your prompt when you&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=2602) copy paste. Okay, it is like this. And I need to&nbsp; select my LoRA. So my LoRA is this one. High noise&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=2610) low noise auto. So this was trained exactly as I&nbsp; have just shown you. This is the highest quality&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=2616) and let's generate. So this generation will&nbsp; take significantly more time compared to the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=2623) fast generation which is Wan 2.2 text to video 8&nbsp; steps. Actually this is 4 steps. I forgotten to&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=2630) change its name. Yes, this is 4 steps. So it will&nbsp; take more time but this is the highest quality&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=2637) that you are going to get with video generation,&nbsp; with text to video generation. For image to video,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=2642) it doesn't make that much big difference. You can&nbsp; perfectly use this preset. But for text to video&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=2649) generation, it makes really big difference&nbsp; still because none of the recent LoRAs are,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=2655) the lightning LoRAs are still as good as the image&nbsp; to video LoRAs. I am using the latest LoRA which&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=2662) was published only 3 days ago. You see they&nbsp; are 17 December 2025 LoRAs but it is as I say.

- [00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=2670) So the generation started. As you can see, it&nbsp; should be done in like 6 minutes if I remember&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=2677) correctly. We will see. Okay, so we got our video&nbsp; generated. It is not the best video. The quality&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=2683) is good but the prompt is bad. So therefore I&nbsp; need to edit my prompt and generate new one.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=2690) The prompting do matters a lot. So play with your&nbsp; prompts to get the best results. Remember all the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=2698) generations will be inside your SwarmUI, inside&nbsp; output, inside local, inside raw folder. So you&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=2706) will see all of your generations here. They will&nbsp; be saved by the date, latest date folder. You will&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=2713) see and find your images and videos in this&nbsp; folder if you need them later. Furthermore,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=2719) you will see them in the history tab as well&nbsp; from the raw and with the folders like this.

- [00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=2725) So as a next step, I will show how to train on&nbsp; Massed Compute then I will show on RunPod. So&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=2732) for Massed Compute, enter inside the extracted zip&nbsp; file folder and open Massed Compute instructions&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=2738) read txt. Reading this file is mandatory&nbsp; and watching the Windows tutorial part are&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=2743) mandatory. Please use this link to register. I&nbsp; appreciate that very much. Then go to billing&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=2750) and set up some credits. They accept crypto&nbsp; payments as well. Then go to deploy. In here,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=2757) I recommend you to use RTX Pro 6000 Blackwell GPU.&nbsp; This is working really great. From the category,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=2764) select creator, select SECourses. Then enter&nbsp; your coupon. This is important. We are going&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=2770) to use Category Creator, Image SECourses&nbsp; and discount coupon SECourses. You see the,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=2776) this very powerful GPU is 1.8 dollars&nbsp; per hour. When I apply my coupon,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=2783) it becomes 1.35 dollars. If you want&nbsp; even more powerful GPU, faster training,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=2789) select H200 NVL. This is even more powerful than&nbsp; RTX Pro 6000. It is 2.6 dollars. With our coupon,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=2798) it becomes 1.95 dollars. This is the fastest GPU.&nbsp; So you can use either of them. Let's use H200 for&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=2806) this demonstration, for this tutorial. Deploy.&nbsp; Now we need to wait for machine to initialize.

- [00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=2813) To connect our machine, we are going to&nbsp; use ThinLinc Client. Download it. If you&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=2817) followed other tutorials, you already know. After&nbsp; downloading, just next, next, next. Then you need&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=2823) to set your shared folder from local devices.&nbsp; You see clipboard synchronization and drives.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=2829) And in here I have a shared folder with read&nbsp; and write permission. So I can copy my small&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=2834) files and I can connect. For big files, you&nbsp; need to watch this tutorial. This will show&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=2841) you how to upload and download big files to&nbsp; Hugging Face. You can also use Google Drive&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=2846) or OneDrive. So other cloud services as well. You&nbsp; know how to use them. But you cannot use ThinLinc&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=2853) Client to transfer big files. So let's just&nbsp; wait for initialization to be complete. Okay,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=2859) now it is running. You may refresh page time to&nbsp; time to update but it was auto updated for me.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=2865) Then click here and copy login URL. Open ThinLinc&nbsp; Client. Copy username for first time users and&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=2872) copy password and connect. Then continue. Then&nbsp; click start. It will start the machine and&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=2880) connect from the ThinLinc Client. Remember this&nbsp; is running on a remote machine, not on my machine.

- [00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=2885) Now I need to transfer my file, my installer file.&nbsp; You can use Patreon login from this browser or you&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=2893) can use the shared folder which I prefer. So I&nbsp; will copy my file into my shared folder. You can&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=2901) also put your training images here. Go back to&nbsp; home from here. Go to Thin Drives. This is your&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=2906) shared folder. Do not run anything inside here.&nbsp; Run everything from downloads folder. Whatever it&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=2913) is. It doesn't matter. The transfer speeds are not&nbsp; great with ThinLinc Client. Therefore you should&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=2918) use the other method that I have just shown you,&nbsp; the link. You see this link for big files. Okay,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=2924) I will copy paste my images. Drag and drop or copy&nbsp; paste both works. And our latest SECourses Musubi&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=2933) Tuner Premium Installer. So it is here. Drag and&nbsp; drop into downloads folder. Wait for files to be&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=2939) transferred. You see it is being transferred right&nbsp; now. Then go to downloads folder. Extract the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=2945) Musubi Tuner. Extract here. And I will open the&nbsp; Massed Compute instructions. Copy this command.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=2952) While I am inside this folder, open in terminal.&nbsp; This is important. And paste. You need to be&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=2958) in the accurate folder. Then it will start the&nbsp; installation. You will see that installation is&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=2963) lightning fast. Actually let's see in real time.&nbsp; So it is going to use uv package installation.

- [00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=2970) I mean look at the speed. Look at the&nbsp; installation speed. It will take like&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=2973) 30 seconds. Maybe 1 minute maximum. So it is&nbsp; almost done. Also we need to download training&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=2980) models. So in here you see there is this command.&nbsp; python3 download_train_models. Again while I am&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=2986) inside this folder, open in terminal. Paste. And&nbsp; it will ask you which models to download. So let's&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=2993) download text to video option 4. The download will&nbsp; begin. The downloader is also optimized. It will&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=3000) be pretty fast. You see 500 megabytes per second.&nbsp; So it is 4 gigabits per second. 4 gigabits. So it&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=3008) will be done almost in no time. The installation&nbsp; also completed and the trainer started. You see&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=3015) installation take like 60 seconds. The rest&nbsp; is exactly same as in the Windows tutorial.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=3022) You will open your configuration. And there&nbsp; is one advantage because configuration is&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=3027) set for Massed Compute folders directly. So&nbsp; I will download the Wan 2.2 training configs,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=3034) text to video configs. Whether you want to&nbsp; use dual GPU or whichever GPU. So this one&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=3041) is using 140 gigabytes of GPU. Let's see our&nbsp; VRAM. nvidia-smi. Okay we have 140 gigabytes.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=3049) Therefore I am going to use this config. I&nbsp; hope it fits. You see it is maximum. Then&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=3054) I need to set my output folder and other thing.&nbsp; I think output folder is already set. So I need&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=3060) to set my training images or videos. So&nbsp; extract here. Okay. So copy this path and&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=3068) copy paste here. Then don't forget to click&nbsp; generate dataset configuration. And let's see&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=3074) if the model download is completed. Yes almost&nbsp; completed. You see 3 over 4. It is verifying.

- [00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=3082) So literally with like 5 minutes setup, you&nbsp; can begin training in Massed Compute. Like 5&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=3089) minutes. Maybe 4 minutes. Once you do this like 1&nbsp; or 2 times, you will get used to it. You will be&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=3095) immediately setup a machine and start training&nbsp; right away. Okay high noise model is getting&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=3102) verified. I am also verifying files. Therefore&nbsp; you will never have any issues with downloaded&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=3107) models. This is super important because sometimes&nbsp; models get corrupted and it is causing a lot of&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=3112) issues. Okay it is downloading the last model.&nbsp; It is 50 seconds remaining time. Okay so all&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=3118) the downloads have been completed. Now I did&nbsp; set the training dataset and start training.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=3125) It should work if the folder paths are accurate&nbsp; if I remember but probably we need to change one&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=3131) more thing. Not ready yet. So in the 1 Models&nbsp; Settings, yes. You see this is 23 version so I&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=3138) need to make this 24. You also need to change&nbsp; that. The output folder should be okay. Yes&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=3146) it is okay. And start training. Now let's see.&nbsp; Oh by the way if this was a 2 model training,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=3153) yes it was. I need to also change this. So&nbsp; dual model. Okay. Now it will give another&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=3158) error and I will click training again. So first&nbsp; it is caching the training dataset. Okay it&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=3165) is loading. Okay I will stop and click start&nbsp; again. Yes now it should work perfectly fine.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=3171) Let's follow both of that. So let's zoom in.&nbsp; Another zoom. Okay. Let's see in real time. So&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=3179) starting training. Loading models. You see loading&nbsp; models are amazingly fast. Blazing fast on Massed&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=3186) Compute. This is why I like Massed Compute over&nbsp; RunPod. The disk speed on Massed Compute is like&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=3192) 10x, maybe 20x faster than the RunPod. Okay 77&nbsp; gigabytes. Okay now it is training the low noise&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=3200) then it will begin the high noise. Okay training&nbsp; is starting. 4 steps done on the first model then&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=3207) it will load the second model. The logic of dual&nbsp; training is that it switches models between. Okay&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=3213) why it is taking time? I think the first step is&nbsp; taking time. Okay. Now it did begin. Yes. So the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=3223) training started. We will see the training speed&nbsp; gets better. Okay it is using 80 gigabytes right&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=3230) now. But the training speed is getting better.&nbsp; You see 2.2 second. It will get faster than 1 IT&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=3237) per second. But it is still switching models.&nbsp; So what we can do, we can disable this and&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=3244) see if it works. So let's disable this to get&nbsp; even faster. Did we load the inaccurate model?&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=3250) Yeah this should be disabled. I will update&nbsp; this configuration for you so you won't have&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=3255) this issue. Now it should be even faster than&nbsp; before because it will not offload each model.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=3261) It will load both of the models into the GPU.&nbsp; Let's see the speed. Of course you can enable&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=3267) fp8 scaled. It will take even lesser VRAM so you&nbsp; can load it into like 80 gigabytes GPUs as well.

- [00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=3275) Okay training started. You see it is 1.5&nbsp; IT per second using only 106 gigabytes of&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=3285) GPU. I will update the configuration so&nbsp; you won't have this issue. But this is&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=3289) the training speed. It is going to&nbsp; take only 67 minutes. So with like&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=3294) 2 dollars, you will be able to train very best&nbsp; Wan 2.2 model. And it's a dual model training,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=3302) not single model. You are seeing the speed right&nbsp; now. 1.35 IT per second. It is amazing. And it&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=3309) will take only 68 minutes and we are doing 5600&nbsp; steps. Not a low number of steps. So it is working&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=3317) just amazing. Yes I have updated the config as&nbsp; 140 gigabytes and it is using 107 gigabytes GPU.

- [00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=3325) So now I will show how to train on RunPod. The&nbsp; rest of the Massed Compute is same. You just&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=3332) need to download your LoRA files and use&nbsp; on your computer or you can use in Massed&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=3337) Compute as well. If you wonder how to use&nbsp; on Massed Compute, on our channel SECourses,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=3344) we have a video for this. The video is this one.&nbsp; Generate AI art 10x faster. The ultimate SwarmUI&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=3350) and ComfyUI cloud tutorial. You can watch this&nbsp; tutorial to learn how to use SwarmUI on Massed&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=3357) Compute or on RunPod. This tutorial covers both&nbsp; of them. So for training on RunPod, we have RunPod&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=3365) instructions. Open that file. Always you need&nbsp; to follow this file for RunPod. Please register&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=3372) RunPod from this link. After registering and&nbsp; logging in, go to billing and set up some credits.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=3380) Then once you have the credits, go to pods.&nbsp; If you want to use permanent storage, I have&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=3386) a tutorial for that. It is here. If you want&nbsp; to learn how to upload and download big files,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=3391) the tutorial is here. And if you want to learn&nbsp; RunPod usage, there is another tutorial here.

- [00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=3396) So I will show on RunPod with RTX 5090. One of&nbsp; the most commonly used one. But you can use bigger&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=3405) GPUs like B200 for even faster training. So this&nbsp; is the disk type and this is the RAM GPU filters&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=3411) that I use. Let's select RTX 5090. Now a lot of&nbsp; people are getting confused here. You are not&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=3418) going to use this template. You are always going&nbsp; to use the template that I write in this file.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=3425) Always. Because my installers are optimized for&nbsp; whatever it is written here. Otherwise you will&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=3430) get errors. So change template. Select PyTorch&nbsp; 2.2.0. This is official template. Click edit&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=3438) and increase the disk size like 200. It is up to&nbsp; you. If you want to save more checkpoints, you&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=3444) need to increase this. Set overrides and deploy on&nbsp; demand. Now we need to wait for machine to become&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=3452) ready but it should be very fast because this&nbsp; is official template. This is very lightweight&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=3457) template. So let's see. Time to time click here.&nbsp; Okay it is ready. Jupyter Lab. If this doesn't&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=3463) open, you need to refresh, click some several&nbsp; times. If still doesn't work, get a new machine.

- [00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=3469) Then I will upload my downloaded zip file. Wait&nbsp; for upload to complete. You see in the bottom it&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=3474) shows. Then right click and extract archive.&nbsp; Click refresh. Then open RunPod instructions&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=3480) read txt file. Copy this command. Open a new&nbsp; terminal from here. And terminal. Make sure&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=3487) that you are in the workspace and copy paste&nbsp; like this. Then it will start the installation.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=3492) So run the commands inside workspace folder.&nbsp; Open new terminal. Make sure that you are in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=3498) workspace wherever you have extracted the files.&nbsp; The installation will be extremely fast compared&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=3505) to before. Why? Because we are using uv package.&nbsp; While installation is continuing, let's download&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=3511) the model because model download may be slow.&nbsp; Open another terminal. Copy paste. Select the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=3518) model text to video. It will start downloading.&nbsp; This is also super optimized. Let's see. You&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=3524) see it is downloading with like 300 megabytes per&nbsp; second. Pretty good. The uv installation is also&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=3530) ultra fast. Before it was taking sometimes 10&nbsp; minutes, 20 minutes, 30 minutes to install. Now&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=3536) it will take only few minutes to install. This&nbsp; is our latest optimization. I will move my all&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=3543) installers to uv installation hopefully slowly.&nbsp; So you will always install my applications much&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=3550) faster now compared to before. Also models&nbsp; are getting downloading meanwhile. So after&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=3555) installation it will auto start the application.&nbsp; This warning is not important. You will get&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=3560) this in all installers. The model merging and&nbsp; verification on RunPod is sadly slow compared&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=3567) to Massed Compute because its disk speed&nbsp; is very slow compared to Massed Compute.

- [00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=3572) Okay application installation completed and&nbsp; started. I will open the Gradio live link.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=3578) However model downloading is still continuing.&nbsp; Meanwhile let's also upload our training images.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=3584) So for upload click this icon. Select your&nbsp; training images as a zip file. Upload. I&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=3590) prefer this way of uploading. So we can set up the&nbsp; configuration while models are getting downloaded.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=3596) Wait for upload to be completed. You see it is&nbsp; slow. You can also use runpodctl for uploading.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=3602) I explain that in another tutorial video. For&nbsp; example you can watch this one. But it is not&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=3608) mandatory to learn or you can use this tutorial&nbsp; to upload and download big files very fast. This&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=3614) is the recommended tutorial. And interface&nbsp; is here. This is running on RunPod. 1 Models&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=3620) Training. So from the configurations, let's&nbsp; pick the configuration we want to use. Let's&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=3626) use the text to image configuration. So you see&nbsp; we have 32 gigabytes. Copy path. Right click and&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=3632) copy path. Put a backslash. Always RunPod&nbsp; puts a backslash to beginning of path and&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=3639) paste it. Then click this. It will auto load the&nbsp; config. You see it is loaded successfully. Then&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=3646) set your output folder. Let's save them inside&nbsp; workspace a new folder: Trained LoRAs. Right&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=3654) click and copy path. Then paste it here. Put a&nbsp; backslash to the beginning. This is important.

- [01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=3660) If you want to do Qwen training, it is same. We&nbsp; only load Qwen training into here. So this is how&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=3666) you train on RunPod. You can change your save&nbsp; name or save every n epochs. And the training&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=3672) dataset. So I have uploaded my images. Right click&nbsp; and extract archive. And they are named like this.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=3679) Remember this is mandatory. 1_ohwx. ohwx will be&nbsp; our captions. 1 is the repeating. So I am going to&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=3688) give the path of the parent folder. Copy as, right&nbsp; click and copy as path. Backslash, put the path&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=3695) then click generate dataset configuration.&nbsp; It is done. Then the 1 Models Settings,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=3701) we need to set the folder paths. So the models are&nbsp; downloaded inside Training Models 1. So copy path&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=3709) and change them like this. And backslash. Okay.&nbsp; No not like this. It needs to be like this. Yes.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=3717) So this is the accurate pathing on RunPod. So like&nbsp; this. Yes. Verify the paths. And like this. Okay&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=3726) all paths are set. This is single model so there&nbsp; is no high noise. And what else is left? Nothing&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=3732) else is left. Save your configuration always.&nbsp; So you can load later if any error happens,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=3738) if you restart. Okay the models are still being&nbsp; downloaded. We need to wait them to be completed.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=3744) If you use RunPod permanent network storage&nbsp; system, you won't be needed to wait. However&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=3750) currently we are not using. But it is also&nbsp; very slow. I mean unbearably slow. And you&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=3756) see only 260 megabyte per second disk speed. On&nbsp; Massed Compute this is 2 gigabytes per second.

- [01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=3763) Okay all models downloaded. It is verifying the&nbsp; last one. So we can start training. So make sure&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=3770) to save and click start training. Then we will&nbsp; follow what is happening on CMD window. This&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=3778) is where we see the actual logs. If there is any&nbsp; error, you need to report from here. Unfortunately&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=3784) setting up RunPod, starting training is like&nbsp; 10x slower than the Massed Compute. But it has&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=3791) some other advantages like permanent storage or&nbsp; more GPU options. However this is the reality.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=3798) You see I click start training and I am still&nbsp; waiting for it to read from the disk to start&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=3804) caching, loading models. Okay let's also install&nbsp; nvitop. pip install nvitop and just type nvitop.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=3814) So we can monitor the GPU usage as well. If&nbsp; you don't see GPU here, that means that your&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=3821) machine is broken. It is going to start caching&nbsp; the text encoder outputs. It is started. Nice.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=3827) Now it will load model. Oh one more thing. We can&nbsp; increase the model loading speed. So I will stop&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=3834) training. How? Open all panels and search for&nbsp; loading and disable numpy memory mapping. This&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=3842) will increase your loading speed significantly&nbsp; on RunPod. So start training. Don't worry it&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=3848) will just resume from wherever it is left. So we&nbsp; didn't lose any time. This is really speeding up&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=3854) the model loadings on RunPod. Okay now we need&nbsp; to wait again. Okay it is loading the model.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=3860) Pretty fast. This optimization is making huge&nbsp; difference on RunPod. This has been implemented&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=3867) after I have taught this issue to Kohya. But&nbsp; still nothing fast as the Massed Compute.

- [01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=3874) Okay training starting. You can monitor the GPU&nbsp; from nvitop. Yes started. You see the first step&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=3881) speed was very slow. Now 1.46, 2 second IT, 2.15&nbsp; second IT. This is slower than the other GPUs&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=3890) because we are also doing some block swapping&nbsp; since this is not fp8 scaled. So when we go&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=3897) to swap, let's see how many we are doing. We are&nbsp; doing 10 block swapping. If you want even faster&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=3903) training, you can do fp8 scaled training and&nbsp; you can make the block swap zero and it will be&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=3909) faster. But this is okay speed. It is going to&nbsp; take like 4 5 hours. So it is bearable maybe a&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=3916) little bit more. But this is how you do training&nbsp; on RunPod. The models will be saved inside my&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=3923) Trained LoRAs folder. You see it is already&nbsp; generated and the dataset TOML file is saved&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=3929) there. The training TOML file also saved there&nbsp; when you click training. So you will download&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=3933) LoRAs from here and use them. Or if you want to&nbsp; use them on RunPod, we have a tutorial for how&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=3939) to use SwarmUI and ComfyUI on RunPod. It is here.&nbsp; This is a very recent tutorial. Fully up to date.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=3945) So you can follow this tutorial to learn how&nbsp; to use SwarmUI and ComfyUI on RunPod and Massed&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=3952) Compute. So this is it. I hope you have enjoyed.&nbsp; Don't forget to stop your machine, terminate your&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=3959) machine. On Massed Compute, you need to delete&nbsp; your machine. Stopping your machine will not&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=3964) stop your credit spending. Don't forget that. But&nbsp; before deleting, make sure to backup all of your&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=3971) data. On RunPod, you can stop your machine and&nbsp; it will keep your data then you need to terminate&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=3977) your machine to completely avoid credit usage. But&nbsp; stopping machine will make it very minimal amount&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=3984) of credit usage. If you have any questions, always&nbsp; ask me. We have Z Image Turbo LoRA training, very&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=3991) up to date, working amazing, very lightweight.&nbsp; We have Flux SRPO training updated. We have Qwen&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=4000) training that you need to watch. Hopefully more&nbsp; videos are coming, more applications are coming.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocEkhAsPOs4&t=4005) I am working 7 days every week literally like 10&nbsp; hours a day. So stay subscribed, leave a comment,&nbsp;&nbsp;
