VEO 3 AI is rocking generative AI field right now. FLOW is the platform that lets you use VEO 3 with so many cool features. This is an official tutorial and guide made by Google team. I edited it slightly. I hope this be helpful.

FLOW : [https://labs.google/flow/about](https://labs.google/flow/about)

Veo 3 is Google DeepMind’s most advanced video generation model to date. It allows users to create high-quality, cinematic video clips from simple text prompts, making it one of the most powerful AI tools for video creation. What sets Veo 3 apart is its ability to generate videos with native audio. This means that along with stunning visuals, Veo 3 can produce synchronized dialogue, ambient sounds, and background music—all from a single prompt. For filmmakers, this is a significant leap forward, as it eliminates the need for separate audio generation or complex syncing processes. Veo 3 also excels in realism, accurately simulating real-world physics and ensuring precise lip-syncing for characters, making the generated content feel remarkably lifelike.

Introducing Flow: AI Filmmaking Made Seamless

While Veo 3 handles the heavy lifting of video and audio generation, Flow is the creative interface that brings it all together. Flow is Google’s new AI filmmaking tool, custom-designed to work with Veo 3, as well as Google’s other advanced models like Gemini (for natural language processing) and Imagen (for text-to-image generation). Flow is built to be intuitive, allowing filmmakers to describe their ideas in everyday language and see them transformed into cinematic scenes. It offers a suite of features that give creators unprecedented control over their projects, from camera movements to scene transitions, all while maintaining consistency across clips.

Flow is more than just a video generator; it’s a comprehensive platform for storytelling. Filmmakers can bring their own assets or generate new ones using Imagen’s text-to-image capabilities. These assets—whether characters, locations, or objects—can be reused across different scenes, ensuring visual and narrative consistency. Flow’s design is inspired by the creative process itself, aiming to make filmmaking feel effortless and full of possibility.

Key Features of Veo 3 and Flow

The combination of Veo 3 and Flow offers a range of powerful features that are reshaping how films are made:

Native Audio Generation (Veo 3): Veo 3’s ability to generate audio—including dialogue, sound effects, and ambient noise—is groundbreaking. For example, a prompt describing a busy subway car can generate not only the visual of the scene but also the sounds of the train, conversations, and background noise, all perfectly synchronized.

Improved Prompt Adherence and Realism (Veo 3): Veo 3 can follow complex prompts with remarkable accuracy, translating detailed descriptions into videos that match the user’s vision. Its ability to replicate real-world physics—like the way objects move or interact—adds authenticity to every frame.

Camera Controls (Flow): Flow gives users direct control over camera motion, angles, and perspectives. This feature lets filmmakers frame shots and dictate camera movements, much like a director on a traditional film set.

Scenebuilder (Flow): This tool enables seamless editing and extension of shots. Filmmakers can reveal more of the action or transition smoothly to the next scene while maintaining consistent characters and motion—perfect for crafting flowing narratives.

Asset Management (Flow): Flow’s asset management system allows users to organize and reuse creative elements across different clips, ensuring that characters, settings, and objects remain consistent throughout a story.

### Video Transcription


- [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoEmQPU2gtg&t=0) Hi, I'm Noah from the Flow team. I'm going to&nbsp; give you a quick walkthrough of what Flow is&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoEmQPU2gtg&t=4) and how it works. Flow is a generative&nbsp; video tool co-created with filmmakers&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoEmQPU2gtg&t=8) to help them create better clips and scenes&nbsp; using AI. The entire tool is a combination of&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoEmQPU2gtg&t=13) Google DeepMind's most advanced models: VEO,&nbsp; Imagen, and Gemini. So let's jump right in.

- [00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoEmQPU2gtg&t=19) This is the project view where all of your&nbsp; projects live. It's really easy to scroll and&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoEmQPU2gtg&t=23) look through everything you're working on. When&nbsp; you click into a project or start a new one, all&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoEmQPU2gtg&t=28) of your generations for this project will appear&nbsp; as you make them. Let's focus here on the prompt&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoEmQPU2gtg&t=33) box. By default, it is set to text-to-video. You&nbsp; can type something in and you'll get a video back.

- [00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoEmQPU2gtg&t=40) You'll see there's a drop-down menu where&nbsp; you can switch between different modes.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoEmQPU2gtg&t=44) Let's explore frames-to-video. In each mode,&nbsp; you'll see these little chips that give you&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoEmQPU2gtg&t=48) specific options for that mode. You have the&nbsp; option to use a first frame, a last frame,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoEmQPU2gtg&t=52) or both. This chip opens your ingredients&nbsp; drawer, which is a collection of previously&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoEmQPU2gtg&t=57) used frames that you can select to reuse.&nbsp; You can also either upload or generate an&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoEmQPU2gtg&t=62) image to use as a frame. Another chip here&nbsp; is where you'll find camera controls. You&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoEmQPU2gtg&t=66) can select the camera icon and add a camera&nbsp; move into your generation without having to&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoEmQPU2gtg&t=70) describe it in the prompt. You also get a&nbsp; little preview of what that camera move is.

- [00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoEmQPU2gtg&t=77) Now, let's take a look at ingredients-to-video&nbsp; mode. This is similar to frames-to-video,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoEmQPU2gtg&t=82) but instead of using the image&nbsp; as your first or last frame,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoEmQPU2gtg&t=84) you can select a few ingredients to combine&nbsp; in 1 scene and add a prompt of how you want&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoEmQPU2gtg&t=89) them to interact in the clip. As you&nbsp; continue to use the same ingredients,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoEmQPU2gtg&t=93) you'll see how easy it is to achieve character,&nbsp; location, and object consistency across shots.

- [00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoEmQPU2gtg&t=98) Now that we have a clip that we like, let's&nbsp; bring it over to scene builder and make a&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoEmQPU2gtg&t=101) little sequence. You can hover over the clip&nbsp; to see the button that says Add to Scene. And&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoEmQPU2gtg&t=106) that automatically moves you into the scene&nbsp; builder. Here we are in the scene builder,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoEmQPU2gtg&t=109) where you can put multiple clips together to&nbsp; create a scene. Let's take a look at some of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoEmQPU2gtg&t=113) ways you can do that. This feature is called Jump&nbsp; To. It uses the power of Gemini to understand how&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoEmQPU2gtg&t=118) your previous clip ended to seamlessly generate&nbsp; the next 1 in the sequence, guided by your prompt.

- [00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoEmQPU2gtg&t=124) You can use these handles here to trim the&nbsp; clips in your scene. Use this plus button and&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoEmQPU2gtg&t=130) select Extend, and add a prompt to extend the clip&nbsp; that you are working with to make longer scenes.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoEmQPU2gtg&t=136) There's another plus button here above the&nbsp; playhead which allows you to save a frame&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoEmQPU2gtg&t=140) for later, in case you want to generate&nbsp; more clips starting or ending with that&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoEmQPU2gtg&t=144) frame. Once you have all of your clips&nbsp; generated, you can also rearrange them&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoEmQPU2gtg&t=148) in the sequence with this button. Then,&nbsp; you click here and download your scene.

- [00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoEmQPU2gtg&t=154) How do you feel about watching some VEO3 now?&nbsp;

- [00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoEmQPU2gtg&t=156) Yeah. Welcome to VEO3&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoEmQPU2gtg&t=163) News. I bet you didn't think we were bringing&nbsp; in a hologram for an interview. Now, did you?&nbsp;

- [00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoEmQPU2gtg&t=167) The music is really about bringing that feeling,&nbsp; that sensation, that experience into the light.&nbsp;

- [00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoEmQPU2gtg&t=175) We interrupt this VEO3 transmission&nbsp; because the universes are colliding.
