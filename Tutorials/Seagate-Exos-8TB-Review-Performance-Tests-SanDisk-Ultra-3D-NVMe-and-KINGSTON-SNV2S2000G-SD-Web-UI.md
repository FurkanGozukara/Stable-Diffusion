### Video Transcription


- [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xc9-4lYfhzk&t=0) Greetings everyone, I have purchased two&nbsp; Seagate 8TB Enterprise Exos disks to build a&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xc9-4lYfhzk&t=7) new Raid 1 and move my files. As AI progress with&nbsp; significant speed and programs take more space,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xc9-4lYfhzk&t=13) I needed to upgrade my existing Raid. So today I&nbsp; am going to do speed review of the following disks&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xc9-4lYfhzk&t=20) and compare their performance with most up-to-date&nbsp; hard drive testing applications. Moreover,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xc9-4lYfhzk&t=26) I will do fresh installation of Automatic1111 Web&nbsp; UI on each disks and compare their installation&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xc9-4lYfhzk&t=33) speed and the model file loading speed as well.&nbsp; So this is the photo of my newly purchased disks.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xc9-4lYfhzk&t=38) Let's begin with initializing them. To do&nbsp; that, let's open administrative tools. I&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xc9-4lYfhzk&t=43) have just typed ADM and the administrative tools&nbsp; appeared. Open that. In here you will see computer&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xc9-4lYfhzk&t=49) management. Click that. Double click actually.&nbsp; Then this window will be opened. In here click&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xc9-4lYfhzk&t=56) the disk management and when you open the disk&nbsp; management you will see the new disks that you&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xc9-4lYfhzk&t=62) have like this. Unallocated. So let's initialize&nbsp; them. Right click. New simple volume. Next. Full&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xc9-4lYfhzk&t=69) space. Next. Assign a letter. Next. Format as&nbsp; NTFS. Perform quick format. Next and finish. Okay,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xc9-4lYfhzk&t=76) let's also make the other one as well. Alright,&nbsp; now let me show you their smart data. Quickly. So&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xc9-4lYfhzk&t=83) this is my data storing disk. It has been online&nbsp; for over 34000 hours. These are the values. It is&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xc9-4lYfhzk&t=91) still looking good. Actually, I also had another&nbsp; one as a Raid 1 and it failed. So this is my 1TB&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xc9-4lYfhzk&t=98) SanDisk Ultra 3D NVME disk. This is my main C&nbsp; drive disk. Kingston 2TB. And these are my newly&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xc9-4lYfhzk&t=107) purchased disks. There are no problems with them.&nbsp; They are looking pretty fresh and correct. Now&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xc9-4lYfhzk&t=113) time to start testing. So these are the testing&nbsp; applications that I am going to test all of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xc9-4lYfhzk&t=119) disks. I will do test on each one of the hard&nbsp; disks and then I will show you the results. I&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xc9-4lYfhzk&t=125) am using the default settings so these settings&nbsp; do matter. Let's begin. Okay, all tests have been&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xc9-4lYfhzk&t=131) completed for AS SSD Benchmark. However, the Raid&nbsp; result is not here yet because I didn't build the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xc9-4lYfhzk&t=138) Raid. I will add the result of that to these&nbsp; results. Then make a comparison of all of them.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xc9-4lYfhzk&t=144) All tests have been completed. Now time to build&nbsp; Raid 1 and do the final test. Then we will start&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xc9-4lYfhzk&t=151) comparison. So for building right one, I will&nbsp; use Intel Optane Memory and Storage Management.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xc9-4lYfhzk&t=158) So this is the beginning screen. You see Raid&nbsp; 1, Yeni_Raid D. One of the disk is missing.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xc9-4lYfhzk&t=165) It was failed and therefore I have purchased&nbsp; these two new disks and now I will build new&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xc9-4lYfhzk&t=171) Raid on these two new disks. Then I will copy all&nbsp; of the data from this disk into the new Raid. For&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xc9-4lYfhzk&t=180) making a new right click create Raid volume. Let's&nbsp; name it as 8TBExos like this. So optimized disk&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xc9-4lYfhzk&t=189) performance Raid 0 or real-time data protection&nbsp; Raid 1. I am going to pick data protection which&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xc9-4lYfhzk&t=195) is what I need next. In here you need to select&nbsp; array disks. So I am selecting both of them. So&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xc9-4lYfhzk&t=202) you can choose keep data from one of the selected&nbsp; disks. Currently both of the disks are just empty.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xc9-4lYfhzk&t=208) Let me show you. So these are the status of the&nbsp; disks. You see both of them are empty. Therefore&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xc9-4lYfhzk&t=215) I am not going to keep any data from the disks.&nbsp; OK then there is also initialize volume. I am&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xc9-4lYfhzk&t=220) not going to pick it and array allocation is 100&nbsp; percent. This will be the new volume size because&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xc9-4lYfhzk&t=226) when you do Raid 1 it is going to write data to&nbsp; both of them. Therefore there won't be any disk&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xc9-4lYfhzk&t=233) increase. Next and I will also pick delete&nbsp; data on create Raid volume. OK the Raid has&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xc9-4lYfhzk&t=240) been generated. However we need to initialize it&nbsp; to be able to use. And there is also cache mode.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xc9-4lYfhzk&t=247) Read only it is. So there are different cache&nbsp; modes and when you click them you will see what&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xc9-4lYfhzk&t=252) differences they have. I am going to pick write&nbsp; through because this cache mode improves data&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xc9-4lYfhzk&t=258) security since the system assumes the data is&nbsp; available only after it has been safely written&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xc9-4lYfhzk&t=263) to the disk. This is really important for me.&nbsp; So save it and then we are ready to initialize&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xc9-4lYfhzk&t=269) it. Let's initialize. The initialization is&nbsp; completed now. It took over 12 hours. However&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xc9-4lYfhzk&t=275) the disk is not visible in the this PC. So I am&nbsp; entering once again the administrative tools,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xc9-4lYfhzk&t=280) computer management, storage, disk management&nbsp; and now it will show me initialize disk. I will&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xc9-4lYfhzk&t=287) initialize it as you are seeing right now. Right&nbsp; click simple volume select the letter as you wish&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xc9-4lYfhzk&t=293) and that's it. And now 2 EXOS enterprise level 8TB&nbsp; Raid 1 is initialized. We can do the final test&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xc9-4lYfhzk&t=301) and we can start comparison. All of the tests have&nbsp; been completed and now we are ready to compare&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xc9-4lYfhzk&t=307) them. But before comparing them I will show you a&nbsp; very cool trick that you can use in your windows.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xc9-4lYfhzk&t=314) I am going to copy entire disk D to my new disk&nbsp; E volume. So which command we are going to use.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xc9-4lYfhzk&t=323) So for copying the entire disk into a new disk we&nbsp; are going to use RoboCopy. This command is using&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xc9-4lYfhzk&t=330) the RoboCopy robust file copy utility to copy&nbsp; all the files and directories from the source&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xc9-4lYfhzk&t=336) directory D to the destination directory E while&nbsp; preserving all file attributes and timestamps.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xc9-4lYfhzk&t=343) You can see the entire command here and the entire&nbsp; description here. Please pause the video and read&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xc9-4lYfhzk&t=350) it if you wish. I will also put this command&nbsp; into the description of the video along with&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xc9-4lYfhzk&t=355) its description. For executing this command I&nbsp; will run my command prompt as an administrator.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xc9-4lYfhzk&t=361) You see when I type cmd the run as administrator&nbsp; appears. After you click it it will start as an&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xc9-4lYfhzk&t=368) administrator. You will see administrator here&nbsp; copy paste the command and then it will start&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xc9-4lYfhzk&t=373) copying entire drive. Since we have hidden the&nbsp; messages of the RoboCopy we need to open the log&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xc9-4lYfhzk&t=381) file we defined. So when you open the RoboCopy log&nbsp; file you will see all of the files that are being&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xc9-4lYfhzk&t=387) copied from your source disk to your destination&nbsp; disk like this. So the first result I am going to&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xc9-4lYfhzk&t=393) demonstrate is Anvil's Storage Utilities. The disk&nbsp; C drive is my main drive which is Kingston NV2 PCI&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xc9-4lYfhzk&t=402) express 4.0 NVMe SSD. Its code is SNV2S2000G.&nbsp; So it's a 2TB SSD and the results are really&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xc9-4lYfhzk&t=414) good even though this disk is my C drive and I&nbsp; have a lot of AI applications and programming&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xc9-4lYfhzk&t=421) applications and other things therefore it is not&nbsp; displaying its best performance but we can see the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xc9-4lYfhzk&t=427) reading writing speeds they are extremely good. So&nbsp; my second disk is completely free of load which is&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xc9-4lYfhzk&t=435) SanDisk SSD 3D NVMe 2M Ultra S 1TB. The results&nbsp; are a little bit better than my main disk in some&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xc9-4lYfhzk&t=445) cases. This is actually not expected however I&nbsp; believe this is because my main disk is my C drive&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xc9-4lYfhzk&t=451) and it is already being used by my applications.&nbsp; However you can see the results they are really&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xc9-4lYfhzk&t=458) really good. So the third disk that I am going&nbsp; to show you is the Seagate Exos 7E8 Enterprise&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xc9-4lYfhzk&t=465) disk ST8000NM000A. The results are really decent&nbsp; for a mechanical disk we can see the read we can&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xc9-4lYfhzk&t=474) see the write results the score it gets is 540 but&nbsp; you see the score difference is tremendous between&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xc9-4lYfhzk&t=483) my SSD and the mechanical disk so the mechanical&nbsp; disk should be only used for storing data. For&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xc9-4lYfhzk&t=490) active use you really need an SSD. For example&nbsp; the SSD is able to read 10 times more data than&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xc9-4lYfhzk&t=498) the mechanical disk. This is a huge difference.&nbsp; So the fourth disk is my old Seagate Enterprise&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xc9-4lYfhzk&t=503) Capacity ST4000NM0024. You see the results are&nbsp; really really bad unfortunately. It is barely able&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xc9-4lYfhzk&t=512) to read 100 megabytes when sequentially reading.&nbsp; The 4 kilobyte reading is terrible even if you&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xc9-4lYfhzk&t=519) use multi-thread. The writings are also very&nbsp; bad. This disk is pretty old and now the time&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xc9-4lYfhzk&t=525) has come for to upgrade it to my newly purchased&nbsp; disk as Raid 1. So here the Raid 1 result of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xc9-4lYfhzk&t=532) new Exos disks. Since Raid 1 mirrors the data the&nbsp; operating system can read half of the data from&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xc9-4lYfhzk&t=539) the one disk and the rest of the data from the&nbsp; other disk. However none of the synthetic tests&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xc9-4lYfhzk&t=544) were very good to use this mirroring feature of&nbsp; Raid 1. So the Raid 1 didn't bring a lot of speed&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xc9-4lYfhzk&t=551) improvement for Anvil's Storage Utilities. The&nbsp; second test we are going to look for is AS SSD&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xc9-4lYfhzk&t=558) Benchmark. So when we compare the reading&nbsp; and writing speed between the Kingston and&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xc9-4lYfhzk&t=563) the SanDisk Ultra SSD we can see the AS SSD were&nbsp; able to utilize the speed of the Kingston better.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xc9-4lYfhzk&t=570) So the reading and writing speeds are looking&nbsp; better for sequential. For 4k there isn't much&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xc9-4lYfhzk&t=577) difference and in the score SanDisk is a little&nbsp; bit better than the Kingston because as I said&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xc9-4lYfhzk&t=584) this is my C drive and SanDisk is just storage&nbsp; device currently so it doesn't have any load.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xc9-4lYfhzk&t=591) So when we look at the newly purchased 8TB Exos&nbsp; disk we can see the speeds are decent much better&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xc9-4lYfhzk&t=599) than my older drive. Especially for 4k writing&nbsp; the speed difference is significant. It is six&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xc9-4lYfhzk&t=605) times better than my older disk. This is a really&nbsp; good one. For 4k reading the speeds are almost&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xc9-4lYfhzk&t=611) same. However when the thread count increases it&nbsp; is also almost three times of my previous disk.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xc9-4lYfhzk&t=618) Therefore this upgrade was worth it. Also it is&nbsp; getting three times of score of the older 4TB&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xc9-4lYfhzk&t=627) disk. However the speed difference between SSD and&nbsp; mechanical disk is just huge once again. And when&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xc9-4lYfhzk&t=633) we do Raid 1 we don't get performance improvement&nbsp; with this synthetic test as well. Okay the fourth&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xc9-4lYfhzk&t=640) result we are going to see is the ATTO Disk&nbsp; Benchmark. In this benchmark I had very rare&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xc9-4lYfhzk&t=646) results. I don't know why I did several times. The&nbsp; writing speeds are extremely low for my Kingston&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xc9-4lYfhzk&t=652) SSD. Maybe this is because a bug that the software&nbsp; has. The reading speeds are looking correct. They&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xc9-4lYfhzk&t=658) are better than the SanDisk but at writing speeds&nbsp; unfortunately they are very bad. I think this is&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xc9-4lYfhzk&t=665) because of the software because I don't see such&nbsp; slowness and I see such speeds in other tests so&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xc9-4lYfhzk&t=673) we can ignore that. These are the results for the&nbsp; SanDisk drive. And now we are seeing the results&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xc9-4lYfhzk&t=678) for new Seagate Exos disks. You see the writing&nbsp; speed and reading speeds are extremely good when&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xc9-4lYfhzk&t=684) you get over 4KB. In the 8KB it is almost same&nbsp; as 64MB. This is very very good. I liked speed&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xc9-4lYfhzk&t=693) so this is a huge improvement. When we compare&nbsp; it with the older 4TB we can see it is performing&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xc9-4lYfhzk&t=700) 2.5 times better than my older 4TB data storage&nbsp; disk. However these speeds are still nothing when&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xc9-4lYfhzk&t=709) compared to SSDs. And when we do Raid 1 in some&nbsp; tests we see some improvement but overly it is&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xc9-4lYfhzk&t=716) almost same so this synthetic test was also not&nbsp; able to utilize Raid 1. And the final synthetic&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xc9-4lYfhzk&t=723) test we are going to see is CrystalDiskMark. This&nbsp; is the most up-to-date synthetic disk benchmarking&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xc9-4lYfhzk&t=729) software. I see slow writing speeds for Kingston&nbsp; disk in this benchmark as well. I don't know the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xc9-4lYfhzk&t=735) reason but for sequential reading and writing the&nbsp; speeds are better than the SanDisk as expected.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xc9-4lYfhzk&t=741) I think this is the only correct result for my&nbsp; Kingston disk in this experimentation. I should&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xc9-4lYfhzk&t=747) search for the cause of this problem. However the&nbsp; speeds are like this. And for the new Exos you see&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xc9-4lYfhzk&t=753) it is reaching 270MB read and 250MB writing for&nbsp; sequential. For random 4K the speeds are terrible&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xc9-4lYfhzk&t=762) as expected from a mechanical disk but still it is&nbsp; much better than my old disk and we see something&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xc9-4lYfhzk&t=770) different in this one. In the Raid 1 mode with&nbsp; Crystal Disk Mark I think it was able to utilize&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xc9-4lYfhzk&t=777) Raid 1 feature. You see the random 4K read and&nbsp; writing speeds are significantly better than the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xc9-4lYfhzk&t=783) single disk mode. So Raid 1 will be effective&nbsp; in real life application I believe. So now I&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xc9-4lYfhzk&t=790) will do real life test. For this task I will use&nbsp; Automatic1111 Stable Diffusion Web UI. I will do&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xc9-4lYfhzk&t=795) fresh installation. However to prevent caching&nbsp; effect because it will download a lot of files&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xc9-4lYfhzk&t=801) I will do an initial installation. Then I will&nbsp; repeat the installations and I will calculate the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xc9-4lYfhzk&t=807) time that it takes to install and start the web&nbsp; UI instance. Okay so the initial installation has&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xc9-4lYfhzk&t=814) been completed. It has cached all of the files.&nbsp; I am also putting the model file so it won't&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xc9-4lYfhzk&t=820) download the model file from the internet. Now I&nbsp; will start another fresh installation. Starting&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xc9-4lYfhzk&t=827) the fresh installation and starting the timer to&nbsp; calculate the time of each installation on each&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xc9-4lYfhzk&t=833) of the drive. So currently this installation&nbsp; is being tested on my main c drive which is&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xc9-4lYfhzk&t=839) Kingston 2TB NVMe SSD. The installation is&nbsp; completed only with 4 minutes and 49 seconds&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xc9-4lYfhzk&t=848) on SanDisk Ultra 3D NVMe drive. Actually&nbsp; this drive is supposed to be slower than my&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xc9-4lYfhzk&t=855) Kingston 2TB SSD. However obviously I have some&nbsp; problems in my computer or my applications are&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xc9-4lYfhzk&t=863) causing this slowness of my 2TB Kingston SSD.&nbsp; Still they are very close and this duration is&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xc9-4lYfhzk&t=871) extremely well for SanDisk. SanDisk is working&nbsp; very well. Interestingly on my slowest D drive&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xc9-4lYfhzk&t=877) it took only 6 minutes and 42 seconds. This is&nbsp; really surprising if you ask me. So this was a&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xc9-4lYfhzk&t=885) completely fresh installation and it worked very&nbsp; fast. It took only 5 minutes and 20 seconds for&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xc9-4lYfhzk&t=892) the new Exos Raid drive. And here the final&nbsp; results of fresh installation times and model&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xc9-4lYfhzk&t=899) load times. I also used the model loading times&nbsp; that is displayed on the CMD window. Therefore&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xc9-4lYfhzk&t=906) you are also seeing the model loading times. As&nbsp; you are seeing using SSD for stable diffusion will&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xc9-4lYfhzk&t=913) increase your model loading times significantly.&nbsp; Therefore if possible host your models on your&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xc9-4lYfhzk&t=920) SSD drives and when you are done with them&nbsp; move them to your storage drives if you don't&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xc9-4lYfhzk&t=926) have sufficient space. Thank you very much for&nbsp; watching. I hope you have enjoyed. Please like,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xc9-4lYfhzk&t=952) hopefully I will make even more better awesome&nbsp; videos. As you have seen Seagate Exos drives&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xc9-4lYfhzk&t=958) are tremendously good for storing data and as&nbsp; the data we use increases we need storage. So&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xc9-4lYfhzk&t=965) I suggest you to get such drives for storing&nbsp; your data. Also using Raid 1 will ensure your&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xc9-4lYfhzk&t=971) data safety even if one disk fails as happened in&nbsp; my case. Raid 1 will save you from data loss. You&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xc9-4lYfhzk&t=979) see one of my Raid has been failed. Therefore&nbsp; now I will transfer all my data from this&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xc9-4lYfhzk&t=985) drive to my new Raid drive. I also have awesome&nbsp; tutorials for Stable Diffusion and new AI stuff&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xc9-4lYfhzk&t=991) on my channel. So don't forget to check them out.&nbsp; Hopefully see you later in another awesome video.
