- 00:00:03.510 Greetings everyone. Today I am going to show you stateofthe-art local image

- 00:00:06.550 show you stateofthe-art local image generation. It is really hard to follow

- 00:00:09.750 generation. It is really hard to follow the latest developments in image

- 00:00:12.549 the latest developments in image generation. Moreover, there are so many

- 00:00:15.270 generation. Moreover, there are so many different information, workflows,

- 00:00:18.070 different information, workflows, instructions.

- 00:00:19.590 instructions. But today I will show you literally one

- 00:00:23.029 But today I will show you literally one click to install and generate the very

- 00:00:26.150 click to install and generate the very best images strategy. I am going to show

- 00:00:29.750 best images strategy. I am going to show you latest state-of-the-art image

- 00:00:32.389 you latest state-of-the-art image generation models with presets. When I

- 00:00:35.430 generation models with presets. When I say preset, it is really really a

- 00:00:38.069 say preset, it is really really a preset. You won't be spending any time

- 00:00:41.910 preset. You won't be spending any time to figure out how to make it work. I

- 00:00:44.549 to figure out how to make it work. I will show you how to generate amazing

- 00:00:47.029 will show you how to generate amazing images for realism and also for

- 00:00:49.350 images for realism and also for stylization with Swarm UI. Swarm UI is

- 00:00:52.790 stylization with Swarm UI. Swarm UI is so much easier to use compared to conf

- 00:00:56.069 so much easier to use compared to conf UI. However, it is still leveraging all

- 00:00:59.670 UI. However, it is still leveraging all the optimizations and features of the

- 00:01:02.470 the optimizations and features of the conf UI. Therefore, currently Swarm UI

- 00:01:05.429 conf UI. Therefore, currently Swarm UI is the best interface, best application

- 00:01:09.670 is the best interface, best application that we can use to generate images and

- 00:01:12.550 that we can use to generate images and you will be surprised that how easy it

- 00:01:15.429 you will be surprised that how easy it is to install and set up. I will show

- 00:01:18.550 is to install and set up. I will show everything. So whether you are an expert

- 00:01:21.109 everything. So whether you are an expert or whether you don't know anything about

- 00:01:23.350 or whether you don't know anything about tech and how to install this stuff, this

- 00:01:26.390 tech and how to install this stuff, this tutorial will show you everything. As

- 00:01:28.630 tutorial will show you everything. As you can see, these images are amazing

- 00:01:31.270 you can see, these images are amazing quality. Obtaining this quality was not

- 00:01:34.710 quality. Obtaining this quality was not easy. I had to do a lot of research.

- 00:01:37.510 easy. I had to do a lot of research. However, I have found the best preset

- 00:01:40.469 However, I have found the best preset for this. With my presets and oneclick

- 00:01:43.429 for this. With my presets and oneclick installers, you will be able to generate

- 00:01:45.910 installers, you will be able to generate these images right away. it will be so

- 00:01:48.550 these images right away. it will be so so easy. Moreover, generating these

- 00:01:51.749 so easy. Moreover, generating these quality images is not requiring a very

- 00:01:55.350 quality images is not requiring a very high-end GPU. All of these images are

- 00:01:58.230 high-end GPU. All of these images are locally generated in my Windows computer

- 00:02:00.789 locally generated in my Windows computer with Swarm UI. I mean, look at the

- 00:02:02.950 with Swarm UI. I mean, look at the realism. This is an ultimate realism

- 00:02:05.510 realism. This is an ultimate realism that we got locally on our Windows PC.

- 00:02:09.029 that we got locally on our Windows PC. So, this tutorial will show you

- 00:02:10.790 So, this tutorial will show you everything. If you are aiming realism or

- 00:02:13.910 everything. If you are aiming realism or stylization after watching this

- 00:02:15.830 stylization after watching this tutorial, you will be able to generate

- 00:02:17.750 tutorial, you will be able to generate both of them locally with so much

- 00:02:20.309 both of them locally with so much easiness that you will be also

- 00:02:22.070 easiness that you will be also surprised. So how it will work exactly?

- 00:02:24.790 surprised. So how it will work exactly? Let's make a quick demonstration. So

- 00:02:26.790 Let's make a quick demonstration. So this is the swarm interface. I will do

- 00:02:29.510 this is the swarm interface. I will do quick tools reset params to default and

- 00:02:31.990 quick tools reset params to default and I will do this direct apply. Then I will

- 00:02:34.949 I will do this direct apply. Then I will type my prompt whatever the prompt you

- 00:02:37.670 type my prompt whatever the prompt you want and hit generate. Then this will

- 00:02:40.390 want and hit generate. Then this will generate the base image not upscale it

- 00:02:43.430 generate the base image not upscale it image. Moreover, currently it is

- 00:02:45.430 image. Moreover, currently it is generating one one ratio. Let's say I

- 00:02:48.869 generating one one ratio. Let's say I want different ratio for example 16 to

- 00:02:51.990 want different ratio for example 16 to 9. I did set it and hit generate. The

- 00:02:55.270 9. I did set it and hit generate. The second one is cute. So after this one is

- 00:02:58.229 second one is cute. So after this one is finished, it will generate the second

- 00:02:59.910 finished, it will generate the second image. And you can see live the preview.

- 00:03:03.750 image. And you can see live the preview. So this is the image being generated.

- 00:03:06.070 So this is the image being generated. Therefore, if you don't like the image,

- 00:03:07.750 Therefore, if you don't like the image, you can just click this X icon and

- 00:03:09.910 you can just click this X icon and cancel it. But let's just wait and see.

- 00:03:12.550 cancel it. But let's just wait and see. Okay, this is the first image. If I like

- 00:03:14.710 Okay, this is the first image. If I like it this image, next step, I will be

- 00:03:17.110 it this image, next step, I will be upscaling it. Let's see the second image

- 00:03:19.430 upscaling it. Let's see the second image as well. And as a third image, let's

- 00:03:21.910 as well. And as a third image, let's generate a realistic one. For example,

- 00:03:24.229 generate a realistic one. For example, this is the prompt I have. I am using

- 00:03:26.790 this is the prompt I have. I am using one 2.2 model right now for generating

- 00:03:29.990 one 2.2 model right now for generating these images. One 2.2 is normally a

- 00:03:33.910 these images. One 2.2 is normally a video generation model. However, we have

- 00:03:37.430 video generation model. However, we have figured out a way a preset to generate

- 00:03:41.270 figured out a way a preset to generate amazing quality images with one 12.2.

- 00:03:44.470 amazing quality images with one 12.2. Okay, this is the second generated

- 00:03:46.070 Okay, this is the second generated image. Let's see the third one and then

- 00:03:48.949 image. Let's see the third one and then let's upscale one of them. So, you see

- 00:03:51.350 let's upscale one of them. So, you see this is so easy with my presets. You

- 00:03:53.830 this is so easy with my presets. You will get this interface. These presets

- 00:03:57.030 will get this interface. These presets you will just apply and generate. And

- 00:03:59.750 you will just apply and generate. And this is the third image. Let's say I

- 00:04:02.070 this is the third image. Let's say I like it this image. So I will say reuse

- 00:04:04.470 like it this image. So I will say reuse parameters. Then in the presets we have

- 00:04:08.869 parameters. Then in the presets we have image upscale. You see upscale images

- 00:04:11.509 image upscale. You see upscale images direct apply and generate. Now it will

- 00:04:15.030 direct apply and generate. Now it will upscale this image into 4x resolution.

- 00:04:18.710 upscale this image into 4x resolution. The width and height will be double. So

- 00:04:21.830 The width and height will be double. So it will be 4x. And we have so many

- 00:04:24.629 it will be 4x. And we have so many amazing presets. You see after you

- 00:04:27.270 amazing presets. You see after you follow with this tutorial you will have

- 00:04:29.110 follow with this tutorial you will have all these presets and you will be able

- 00:04:31.430 all these presets and you will be able to use any of them as you wish. Now it

- 00:04:34.230 to use any of them as you wish. Now it is generating the base image then it

- 00:04:35.990 is generating the base image then it will upscale it and it will add a huge

- 00:04:38.310 will upscale it and it will add a huge amount of details. You will be shocked

- 00:04:40.390 amount of details. You will be shocked by it. And one of the best part of Swarm

- 00:04:43.430 by it. And one of the best part of Swarm UI is that it is using conf UI as a back

- 00:04:47.030 UI is that it is using conf UI as a back end. Therefore it will do automatically

- 00:04:50.150 end. Therefore it will do automatically block swapping, CPU offloading, VAE

- 00:04:53.110 block swapping, CPU offloading, VAE tiling. So it will do all the

- 00:04:55.350 tiling. So it will do all the optimizations according to your hardware

- 00:04:57.749 optimizations according to your hardware like your RAM amount like your VRAM

- 00:04:59.990 like your RAM amount like your VRAM amount like your GPU model it will be

- 00:05:02.710 amount like your GPU model it will be all automatically done for X image

- 00:05:05.350 all automatically done for X image upscaling will take four times compared

- 00:05:08.230 upscaling will take four times compared to generating base image because

- 00:05:10.710 to generating base image because basically we are generating four times

- 00:05:12.870 basically we are generating four times more pixels upscale completed and let's

- 00:05:16.469 more pixels upscale completed and let's look at the details I mean look at this

- 00:05:18.950 look at the details I mean look at this realism these details this image is just

- 00:05:21.990 realism these details this image is just amazing when we compare Compared to the

- 00:05:24.310 amazing when we compare Compared to the base image, this was the image

- 00:05:26.310 base image, this was the image resolution, the quality, the details,

- 00:05:28.710 resolution, the quality, the details, and this is the new image. You may

- 00:05:31.029 and this is the new image. You may notice that the image changed slightly

- 00:05:33.749 notice that the image changed slightly more than what we expect. We can prevent

- 00:05:36.469 more than what we expect. We can prevent it. You can reduce the refinder control

- 00:05:39.189 it. You can reduce the refinder control percentage which will be automatically

- 00:05:41.830 percentage which will be automatically enabled in here. So if you make this

- 00:05:44.230 enabled in here. So if you make this lesser like 50%age, it will change image

- 00:05:47.670 lesser like 50%age, it will change image lesser degree. It is up to you. So based

- 00:05:50.710 lesser degree. It is up to you. So based on your needs, you can reduce this and

- 00:05:53.110 on your needs, you can reduce this and it will make it more like the base image

- 00:05:57.029 it will make it more like the base image maybe a little bit lesser degree of

- 00:05:59.830 maybe a little bit lesser degree of adding new details. So how easy and how

- 00:06:03.670 adding new details. So how easy and how to install Swarm UI this presets confi

- 00:06:08.230 to install Swarm UI this presets confi back end. So easy. First of all, we are

- 00:06:10.870 back end. So easy. First of all, we are going to install conf UI. You will find

- 00:06:13.749 going to install conf UI. You will find this link in the description of the

- 00:06:15.749 this link in the description of the video and also in the comment section of

- 00:06:17.909 video and also in the comment section of the video. Always download the latest

- 00:06:20.309 the video. Always download the latest zip file. And as you scroll down, you

- 00:06:22.870 zip file. And as you scroll down, you will see the change logs. You can read

- 00:06:25.430 will see the change logs. You can read them to learn. But one thing is

- 00:06:27.670 them to learn. But one thing is important. You need to follow Windows

- 00:06:30.629 important. You need to follow Windows requirements tutorial before starting

- 00:06:32.950 requirements tutorial before starting installation. This is one time mandatory

- 00:06:35.990 installation. This is one time mandatory and after that you will be able to run

- 00:06:38.230 and after that you will be able to run all the AI applications without

- 00:06:40.950 all the AI applications without following this again. This is just one

- 00:06:42.790 following this again. This is just one time. First I will show a fresh

- 00:06:45.270 time. First I will show a fresh installation. So I will install it into

- 00:06:47.670 installation. So I will install it into my Q drive and right click and extract

- 00:06:50.550 my Q drive and right click and extract all like this. Make sure that your

- 00:06:52.950 all like this. Make sure that your folder name doesn't have any special

- 00:06:55.189 folder name doesn't have any special characters or any space characters. All

- 00:06:57.670 characters or any space characters. All I need to do is just Windows install or

- 00:07:00.230 I need to do is just Windows install or update confi and run and then according

- 00:07:03.350 update confi and run and then according to your Python version select it. I

- 00:07:05.990 to your Python version select it. I still recommend Python 3.10.11.

- 00:07:09.350 still recommend Python 3.10.11. So I will choose the option one but we

- 00:07:11.510 So I will choose the option one but we support all these. My installer will

- 00:07:14.230 support all these. My installer will install it with Sage Attention, Flash

- 00:07:16.710 install it with Sage Attention, Flash Attention, Three Tone, Xformers.

- 00:07:19.350 Attention, Three Tone, Xformers. Everything is pre-ompiled. Moreover, it

- 00:07:21.909 Everything is pre-ompiled. Moreover, it will automatically install Confi

- 00:07:23.830 will automatically install Confi manager, confi IP adapter, confi guf,

- 00:07:27.510 manager, confi IP adapter, confi guf, and res

- 00:07:29.670 and res yf. Furthermore, if you need reactor or

- 00:07:34.230 yf. Furthermore, if you need reactor or impact pack extensions, you can just run

- 00:07:37.110 impact pack extensions, you can just run their bot files after installation has

- 00:07:39.589 their bot files after installation has been completed. But you don't need it

- 00:07:41.589 been completed. But you don't need it for this tutorial. So what if if you

- 00:07:43.909 for this tutorial. So what if if you need to update your existing confi but

- 00:07:46.870 need to update your existing confi but be careful that you had to have

- 00:07:48.790 be careful that you had to have installed my confi not other

- 00:07:50.710 installed my confi not other installations. Enter inside your

- 00:07:53.110 installations. Enter inside your previous confi folder. Paste the zip

- 00:07:55.990 previous confi folder. Paste the zip file. Make sure to quit from your

- 00:07:59.350 file. Make sure to quit from your running application if you have any.

- 00:08:02.390 running application if you have any. Then right click and extract all. I am

- 00:08:04.550 Then right click and extract all. I am using winrar. You can use anything.

- 00:08:06.390 using winrar. You can use anything. Override all the files. They are

- 00:08:08.550 Override all the files. They are updated. Then doubleclick Windows

- 00:08:11.510 updated. Then doubleclick Windows install or update confi and run. When

- 00:08:14.390 install or update confi and run. When you're updating previous installation,

- 00:08:16.550 you're updating previous installation, it will be really fast. Just follow the

- 00:08:18.710 it will be really fast. Just follow the speed here. You see this is updating

- 00:08:20.869 speed here. You see this is updating right now. Okay, updating. It should be

- 00:08:23.350 right now. Okay, updating. It should be done under 1 minute in total time. Okay,

- 00:08:27.270 done under 1 minute in total time. Okay, still updating. Almost done. We are

- 00:08:29.670 still updating. Almost done. We are getting there. Yes, updated. It took

- 00:08:32.630 getting there. Yes, updated. It took like 30 seconds to update the confi to

- 00:08:35.829 like 30 seconds to update the confi to the latest version with the newest stuff

- 00:08:38.630 the latest version with the newest stuff that we need. This is how my confi

- 00:08:41.269 that we need. This is how my confi installation works. Okay, the fresh

- 00:08:43.509 installation works. Okay, the fresh installation also completed. It took few

- 00:08:46.389 installation also completed. It took few minutes. You can scroll up to see

- 00:08:48.630 minutes. You can scroll up to see whether there are any errors or not.

- 00:08:50.790 whether there are any errors or not. There shouldn't be any errors. Once you

- 00:08:53.269 There shouldn't be any errors. Once you see that, press any K to continue. You

- 00:08:55.509 see that, press any K to continue. You are done with the confi installation. As

- 00:08:58.070 are done with the confi installation. As a next step, we are going to install

- 00:09:00.630 a next step, we are going to install Swarm UI. The link of this post will be

- 00:09:03.110 Swarm UI. The link of this post will be also in the description of the video and

- 00:09:04.949 also in the description of the video and also in the command section. The pin

- 00:09:07.110 also in the command section. The pin command. Download the latest Swarm UI

- 00:09:09.509 command. Download the latest Swarm UI model. Downloader zip file. Move it into

- 00:09:12.230 model. Downloader zip file. Move it into the disk wherever you want to install. I

- 00:09:15.190 the disk wherever you want to install. I will install into my Q drive. Extract

- 00:09:17.750 will install into my Q drive. Extract it. Then you will see that there is

- 00:09:20.470 it. Then you will see that there is Windows install swarmi.bot file. Double

- 00:09:23.750 Windows install swarmi.bot file. Double click run. This will install the latest

- 00:09:27.030 click run. This will install the latest version of the Swarm UI. Swarm UUI

- 00:09:29.430 version of the Swarm UI. Swarm UUI installation is also lightning fast.

- 00:09:32.150 installation is also lightning fast. Okay, it is getting there. Yes, started

- 00:09:35.350 Okay, it is getting there. Yes, started now. Follow my steps. Exactly. I agree.

- 00:09:38.710 now. Follow my steps. Exactly. I agree. Customize settings, not just install.

- 00:09:41.829 Customize settings, not just install. Yes, we can say yes. Choose your DM.

- 00:09:44.630 Yes, we can say yes. Choose your DM. Okay. Next. Next. Now, this is

- 00:09:47.750 Okay. Next. Next. Now, this is important. We are not going to use Confi

- 00:09:49.990 important. We are not going to use Confi local. Okay. This is super important

- 00:09:52.310 local. Okay. This is super important because this confi is very weak and

- 00:09:55.190 because this confi is very weak and problematic. We are going to use the

- 00:09:57.430 problematic. We are going to use the confi we just installed. This is

- 00:09:59.590 confi we just installed. This is mandatory. So select none. Next. You can

- 00:10:02.630 mandatory. So select none. Next. You can download the models that you want. I'm

- 00:10:04.389 download the models that you want. I'm not going to next. And yes I am sure you

- 00:10:07.269 not going to next. And yes I am sure you see it is instant instantly installed.

- 00:10:10.310 see it is instant instantly installed. Then we are going to go to server top

- 00:10:12.949 Then we are going to go to server top back ends and we are going to add confi

- 00:10:16.150 back ends and we are going to add confi self starting. Okay. You see now this

- 00:10:19.750 self starting. Okay. You see now this screen has arrived. We are going to add

- 00:10:22.310 screen has arrived. We are going to add our confi folder pad here. So I had

- 00:10:25.750 our confi folder pad here. So I had installed into my Q drive which is

- 00:10:28.310 installed into my Q drive which is inside here. com confi copy this path

- 00:10:32.389 inside here. com confi copy this path and then back slash main.py.

- 00:10:35.990 and then back slash main.py. So then you can also give some extra

- 00:10:38.310 So then you can also give some extra arguments. What kind of extra arguments?

- 00:10:41.350 arguments. What kind of extra arguments? For example, in the confi you will see

- 00:10:44.069 For example, in the confi you will see that there is like reserve vramm use

- 00:10:46.710 that there is like reserve vramm use sage attention GPU only. This is for

- 00:10:49.590 sage attention GPU only. This is for very high vramm GPUs high vramm. There

- 00:10:52.470 very high vramm GPUs high vramm. There are more options of confi but I am going

- 00:10:55.990 are more options of confi but I am going to use sage attention. The rest can be

- 00:10:58.790 to use sage attention. The rest can be default. This sage attention will

- 00:11:01.910 default. This sage attention will improve my performance significantly.

- 00:11:05.590 improve my performance significantly. Say in some models this can produce

- 00:11:09.590 Say in some models this can produce black output. If you get black output,

- 00:11:11.990 black output. If you get black output, just edit here and delete this.

- 00:11:15.269 just edit here and delete this. Otherwise, you can keep it. And

- 00:11:17.430 Otherwise, you can keep it. And currently, it is going to use my first

- 00:11:19.430 currently, it is going to use my first GPU. If you have multiple GPUs, you can

- 00:11:22.389 GPU. If you have multiple GPUs, you can add another back end like this. Copy

- 00:11:25.590 add another back end like this. Copy this. Paste. Then select the GPU ID one.

- 00:11:29.509 this. Paste. Then select the GPU ID one. You can use extra arguments. Save. So

- 00:11:31.829 You can use extra arguments. Save. So now when I generate two images, it will

- 00:11:35.269 now when I generate two images, it will generate on each GPU. Moreover, I also

- 00:11:37.990 generate on each GPU. Moreover, I also recommend over Q to zero. So it will

- 00:11:40.790 recommend over Q to zero. So it will immediately start on the next available

- 00:11:44.550 immediately start on the next available GPU without waiting. So these are the

- 00:11:47.110 GPU without waiting. So these are the settings that I am using. I don't change

- 00:11:49.110 settings that I am using. I don't change anything else. And when I start the

- 00:11:51.269 anything else. And when I start the Swarm UI again next time, it will also

- 00:11:53.910 Swarm UI again next time, it will also automatically update my confi. You can

- 00:11:56.069 automatically update my confi. You can see that there is always auto update of

- 00:11:58.310 see that there is always auto update of the back end. If you get update errors

- 00:12:00.870 the back end. If you get update errors which you shouldn't, you can manually

- 00:12:02.870 which you shouldn't, you can manually update the confi because we have

- 00:12:05.030 update the confi because we have updater. You see we just run this for

- 00:12:08.550 updater. You see we just run this for swarm your update we have Windows update

- 00:12:10.949 swarm your update we have Windows update swarm UI let me show you that too. So

- 00:12:13.910 swarm UI let me show you that too. So okay it is started so I will just close

- 00:12:15.910 okay it is started so I will just close this double click Windows update swarm

- 00:12:18.230 this double click Windows update swarm UI.bot file it will start right away you

- 00:12:21.910 UI.bot file it will start right away you see it is starting and yes now I need to

- 00:12:24.389 see it is starting and yes now I need to wait again for back ends to load. So

- 00:12:27.910 wait again for back ends to load. So currently in my installation there is no

- 00:12:30.790 currently in my installation there is no presets here. How am I going to use the

- 00:12:34.069 presets here. How am I going to use the presets? We have presets installer. You

- 00:12:37.990 presets? We have presets installer. You can use both ways. When you use the

- 00:12:40.069 can use both ways. When you use the preset installer here, Windows preset

- 00:12:42.470 preset installer here, Windows preset delete import.bot file, it will delete

- 00:12:45.110 delete import.bot file, it will delete your older presets and import new ones.

- 00:12:48.150 your older presets and import new ones. But don't worry, your older presets will

- 00:12:50.790 But don't worry, your older presets will be saved in preset backup. Currently,

- 00:12:54.629 be saved in preset backup. Currently, since I don't have any presets, they are

- 00:12:57.350 since I don't have any presets, they are not saved anywhere. Then I need to click

- 00:13:00.069 not saved anywhere. Then I need to click refresh and all presets arrived. So now

- 00:13:03.509 refresh and all presets arrived. So now you are ready to use like this. And if

- 00:13:06.550 you are ready to use like this. And if you want to update your previous Swarma

- 00:13:08.389 you want to update your previous Swarma installation instead of a fresh

- 00:13:10.310 installation instead of a fresh installation, go to the folder extract

- 00:13:13.509 installation, go to the folder extract zip file, right click and extract all

- 00:13:16.710 zip file, right click and extract all files. Here you can use Windows extract

- 00:13:18.949 files. Here you can use Windows extract system or whatever. Override all files.

- 00:13:21.990 system or whatever. Override all files. Then it is same. You just need to import

- 00:13:25.990 Then it is same. You just need to import new presets. You can import new presets

- 00:13:28.870 new presets. You can import new presets from here. Import presets. Choose file.

- 00:13:31.670 from here. Import presets. Choose file. So this is manual way. Choose the preset

- 00:13:34.230 So this is manual way. Choose the preset file. Override existing presets and

- 00:13:37.030 file. Override existing presets and import. And it will import existing

- 00:13:39.990 import. And it will import existing presets for you. Then click refresh. We

- 00:13:42.949 presets for you. Then click refresh. We have made a fresh installation but we

- 00:13:45.269 have made a fresh installation but we are lacking the models. When I go to

- 00:13:47.030 are lacking the models. When I go to models, there are no models here or

- 00:13:49.509 models, there are no models here or there are no loras here. How we are

- 00:13:51.829 there are no loras here. How we are going to find these models? I made it so

- 00:13:54.629 going to find these models? I made it so easy as well. So this was our fresh

- 00:13:57.030 easy as well. So this was our fresh installation and you see there is

- 00:13:59.110 installation and you see there is Windows start download models appbot

- 00:14:01.910 Windows start download models appbot file. Double click it click run. It will

- 00:14:04.949 file. Double click it click run. It will start our model downloader application.

- 00:14:07.350 start our model downloader application. This application is amazing. You will

- 00:14:09.030 This application is amazing. You will see it. It will also generate a virtual

- 00:14:11.430 see it. It will also generate a virtual environment. All my installers generates

- 00:14:14.310 environment. All my installers generates a virtual environment and install

- 00:14:16.470 a virtual environment and install everything there. So your installed

- 00:14:18.550 everything there. So your installed confi will never break anything else.

- 00:14:21.030 confi will never break anything else. You can have multiple confi

- 00:14:22.629 You can have multiple confi installations. All will be independent.

- 00:14:25.509 installations. All will be independent. You see when I enter inside confi there

- 00:14:27.509 You see when I enter inside confi there is virtual environment. So everything is

- 00:14:29.509 is virtual environment. So everything is installed here nowhere else. So I can

- 00:14:31.829 installed here nowhere else. So I can have as many as different confis that I

- 00:14:33.990 have as many as different confis that I want. Okay. It is getting started. Yes.

- 00:14:37.590 want. Okay. It is getting started. Yes. So this is our model downloader

- 00:14:40.230 So this is our model downloader interface. For this tutorial we are

- 00:14:42.230 interface. For this tutorial we are going to use swarmi bundles image

- 00:14:44.550 going to use swarmi bundles image generation and editing bundle. These

- 00:14:47.110 generation and editing bundle. These will have Cuban image edit plus Cuban

- 00:14:49.990 will have Cuban image edit plus Cuban image best upscaler models face

- 00:14:53.189 image best upscaler models face segmentation models one 2.2 text video

- 00:14:57.030 segmentation models one 2.2 text video model this is what we are going to use

- 00:14:59.110 model this is what we are going to use flux srpo model this is best flux

- 00:15:02.629 flux srpo model this is best flux realism model and the other needed

- 00:15:06.230 realism model and the other needed files. So just click this and follow the

- 00:15:09.670 files. So just click this and follow the cmd window. This downloader is extremely

- 00:15:12.790 cmd window. This downloader is extremely robust. It will download and do hash

- 00:15:16.230 robust. It will download and do hash calculation. Therefore, all the

- 00:15:18.230 calculation. Therefore, all the downloaded models will be verified 100%

- 00:15:21.750 downloaded models will be verified 100% accurate. There can be never any

- 00:15:23.910 accurate. There can be never any corrupted downloaded model file with

- 00:15:26.150 corrupted downloaded model file with this dome ladder. The logic of this

- 00:15:28.550 this dome ladder. The logic of this downloader is that it is like you get if

- 00:15:31.829 downloader is that it is like you get if you have used you will know it. So when

- 00:15:34.230 you have used you will know it. So when I go back to my models folder into

- 00:15:36.710 I go back to my models folder into diffusion models, this is usually where

- 00:15:38.629 diffusion models, this is usually where the models downloaded. You see that it

- 00:15:40.870 the models downloaded. You see that it is 16 parts. So it is downloading with

- 00:15:44.150 is 16 parts. So it is downloading with 16 different connections. Therefore it

- 00:15:46.870 16 different connections. Therefore it is super fast. You see my speed is over

- 00:15:49.350 is super fast. You see my speed is over 100 megabytes per second on my personal

- 00:15:52.470 100 megabytes per second on my personal computer. On cloud machines this is 300

- 00:15:55.110 computer. On cloud machines this is 300 400 mgabytes. When I go to task manager

- 00:15:57.749 400 mgabytes. When I go to task manager and my internet connection you can see

- 00:15:59.829 and my internet connection you can see that it is using 1 gigabit. This is my

- 00:16:02.470 that it is using 1 gigabit. This is my internet speed. Therefore it is maximum

- 00:16:04.870 internet speed. Therefore it is maximum utilizing it. Once this model download

- 00:16:07.829 utilizing it. Once this model download completed, it will merge these files

- 00:16:11.030 completed, it will merge these files into a single file and it has a full

- 00:16:13.910 into a single file and it has a full resume capability. So I will close this

- 00:16:16.230 resume capability. So I will close this to show you. Then start the window start

- 00:16:18.629 to show you. Then start the window start models downloader file like this. Then I

- 00:16:22.230 models downloader file like this. Then I will click the swarmi bundles download

- 00:16:24.550 will click the swarmi bundles download image generation and editing bundle. And

- 00:16:27.030 image generation and editing bundle. And you see it is continuing wherever it is

- 00:16:29.670 you see it is continuing wherever it is left. Believe me this application took a

- 00:16:32.790 left. Believe me this application took a lot of time of me to develop. And this

- 00:16:35.189 lot of time of me to develop. And this is version 85 right now. So when you go

- 00:16:37.590 is version 85 right now. So when you go to URL downloader, you can also download

- 00:16:40.710 to URL downloader, you can also download models from this interface. For example,

- 00:16:43.590 models from this interface. For example, let's download this blocks model. Copy

- 00:16:46.389 let's download this blocks model. Copy this URL. Then paste the model URL here

- 00:16:49.829 this URL. Then paste the model URL here and select the target folder. Since this

- 00:16:52.069 and select the target folder. Since this is blocks model, let's see this is the

- 00:16:55.430 is blocks model, let's see this is the blocks per FP8 model. So this goes into

- 00:16:58.389 blocks per FP8 model. So this goes into models diffusion models. Then click

- 00:17:00.550 models diffusion models. Then click download. it will automatically start

- 00:17:02.790 download. it will automatically start downloading this model as well. However,

- 00:17:04.949 downloading this model as well. However, currently we are downloading other

- 00:17:06.710 currently we are downloading other models. So, it will show both of them at

- 00:17:09.909 models. So, it will show both of them at the same time. But it is so easy. You

- 00:17:12.549 the same time. But it is so easy. You can also provide your own sweet AI or

- 00:17:15.990 can also provide your own sweet AI or hugging face app. But we have some

- 00:17:19.029 hugging face app. But we have some default keys. So, you don't need to

- 00:17:21.110 default keys. So, you don't need to provide them. So, this URL downloader is

- 00:17:23.590 provide them. So, this URL downloader is also extremely useful especially on

- 00:17:25.909 also extremely useful especially on cloud machines on cloud services. So you

- 00:17:28.789 cloud machines on cloud services. So you see this model file has been downloaded

- 00:17:31.430 see this model file has been downloaded Q and image edit plus and it has been

- 00:17:34.070 Q and image edit plus and it has been merged. Now it is downloading the other

- 00:17:36.470 merged. Now it is downloading the other files and when you next time start the

- 00:17:39.029 files and when you next time start the application the verified downloaded

- 00:17:41.430 application the verified downloaded files will be just skipped. It will not

- 00:17:44.230 files will be just skipped. It will not redownload them or if the download has

- 00:17:46.710 redownload them or if the download has been interrupted it will resume. And the

- 00:17:49.029 been interrupted it will resume. And the rest is as I have shown in the beginning

- 00:17:51.830 rest is as I have shown in the beginning I have returned back to my other

- 00:17:53.909 I have returned back to my other installation where I have all the

- 00:17:55.750 installation where I have all the downloaded model files. As you can see

- 00:17:58.070 downloaded model files. As you can see right now before using any preset make

- 00:18:01.750 right now before using any preset make sure that click quick tools reset params

- 00:18:04.870 sure that click quick tools reset params to default. So it will default all the

- 00:18:07.669 to default. So it will default all the parameters. Then go to preset and use

- 00:18:10.310 parameters. Then go to preset and use whatever you want. For example, let's

- 00:18:12.150 whatever you want. For example, let's use the Cuban image realism. This has

- 00:18:15.590 use the Cuban image realism. This has significantly improved my quality with

- 00:18:18.630 significantly improved my quality with Cuban Laura. I will show hopefully soon

- 00:18:21.029 Cuban Laura. I will show hopefully soon it training Cuban Laura direct apply and

- 00:18:23.990 it training Cuban Laura direct apply and paste your prompt. Then select the

- 00:18:26.230 paste your prompt. Then select the aspect ratio that you want. This is also

- 00:18:29.029 aspect ratio that you want. This is also really fast. It is only eight steps. But

- 00:18:31.830 really fast. It is only eight steps. But normally I recommend QAN for stylized

- 00:18:35.750 normally I recommend QAN for stylized images. So for stylized images you can

- 00:18:38.390 images. So for stylized images you can use this preset rather than this one.

- 00:18:41.270 use this preset rather than this one. For realism current I recommend 12.2

- 00:18:44.150 For realism current I recommend 12.2 image realism preset. And for best

- 00:18:46.630 image realism preset. And for best quality I recommend you to upscale

- 00:18:49.270 quality I recommend you to upscale images to 2x. Actually it is 4x

- 00:18:52.230 images to 2x. Actually it is 4x resolution in total. So we are getting

- 00:18:54.230 resolution in total. So we are getting the Q1 image result. I will also show

- 00:18:57.350 the Q1 image result. I will also show you blocks SRPO. It is also really

- 00:19:01.270 you blocks SRPO. It is also really realistic model. So let's see the

- 00:19:03.590 realistic model. So let's see the results of each one. You see the Cuban

- 00:19:05.590 results of each one. You see the Cuban is really fast and this is a really high

- 00:19:07.510 is really fast and this is a really high resolution. It is almost 2 megapixel.

- 00:19:09.750 resolution. It is almost 2 megapixel. Okay. The image has been generated. It

- 00:19:11.510 Okay. The image has been generated. It is not very realistic. The Cuban is not

- 00:19:13.669 is not very realistic. The Cuban is not very realistic. This is the realism we

- 00:19:15.830 very realistic. This is the realism we got. But this is what QAN is. Hopefully

- 00:19:19.029 got. But this is what QAN is. Hopefully you will see that it is way more

- 00:19:20.789 you will see that it is way more realistic with self Laura training. So

- 00:19:23.270 realistic with self Laura training. So let's try this with flux srpo quick

- 00:19:26.549 let's try this with flux srpo quick tools reset params to default then

- 00:19:28.950 tools reset params to default then direct apply. This will select the flux

- 00:19:31.909 direct apply. This will select the flux base model by default. Therefore you

- 00:19:34.390 base model by default. Therefore you need to select flux srpo yourself like

- 00:19:37.190 need to select flux srpo yourself like this. You see the selected model is now

- 00:19:39.029 this. You see the selected model is now flux srpo. Paste your prompt. Select

- 00:19:42.150 flux srpo. Paste your prompt. Select your aspect ratio. Okay. Here and

- 00:19:45.029 your aspect ratio. Okay. Here and generate. Flux srpo is also really fast

- 00:19:47.750 generate. Flux srpo is also really fast to generate. Now it is reloading my

- 00:19:49.830 to generate. Now it is reloading my model. One of the best part of my preset

- 00:19:53.750 model. One of the best part of my preset system is that you can test all of them

- 00:19:55.909 system is that you can test all of them so quickly, compare and decide which one

- 00:19:59.029 so quickly, compare and decide which one is working best for your case. If you

- 00:20:01.190 is working best for your case. If you remember this image was really really

- 00:20:03.029 remember this image was really really realistic on 12.2 preset. So for realism

- 00:20:07.350 realistic on 12.2 preset. So for realism currently 12.2 image realism is my

- 00:20:10.310 currently 12.2 image realism is my number one choice and flux srpo is my

- 00:20:14.390 number one choice and flux srpo is my second choice which we are about to see

- 00:20:16.950 second choice which we are about to see and this is not upscale. Remember we

- 00:20:19.510 and this is not upscale. Remember we need to upscale for even better. Yes,

- 00:20:22.070 need to upscale for even better. Yes, this is flux srpo. It is also really

- 00:20:25.029 this is flux srpo. It is also really realistic. If you upscale this image, it

- 00:20:27.110 realistic. If you upscale this image, it will become much better. So reuse

- 00:20:28.710 will become much better. So reuse parameters direct apply the upscale. You

- 00:20:31.669 parameters direct apply the upscale. You will notice that it has enabled upscale

- 00:20:33.909 will notice that it has enabled upscale and generate. Now we will get much

- 00:20:36.470 and generate. Now we will get much better quality image. If you also don't

- 00:20:39.110 better quality image. If you also don't have a powerful GPU and you want to use

- 00:20:41.750 have a powerful GPU and you want to use cloud services like rampot or mass

- 00:20:44.149 cloud services like rampot or mass compute, I will make separate tutorials

- 00:20:47.190 compute, I will make separate tutorials to show how to install and use that.

- 00:20:49.909 to show how to install and use that. Moreover, I already also have some

- 00:20:52.149 Moreover, I already also have some tutorials for rampot and mass compute.

- 00:20:54.630 tutorials for rampot and mass compute. For example, this tutorial is made for

- 00:20:57.029 For example, this tutorial is made for rampot. So you can watch this to learn

- 00:20:59.510 rampot. So you can watch this to learn how to install comi and swarmi. And this

- 00:21:02.870 how to install comi and swarmi. And this tutorial is showing you how to install n

- 00:21:05.830 tutorial is showing you how to install n compui on mass compute and use the

- 00:21:08.310 compui on mass compute and use the existing swarm UI there. So we already

- 00:21:11.110 existing swarm UI there. So we already have tutorials but I plan to make

- 00:21:13.590 have tutorials but I plan to make specific tutorials for this one as well

- 00:21:17.110 specific tutorials for this one as well for today's tutorial as well. Okay. Now

- 00:21:19.830 for today's tutorial as well. Okay. Now I have upscaled the image. So from this

- 00:21:22.070 I have upscaled the image. So from this image to this image we got it. So it is

- 00:21:25.110 image to this image we got it. So it is up to you. You can try see which one is

- 00:21:27.830 up to you. You can try see which one is working best for your case. And for

- 00:21:29.909 working best for your case. And for stylization, I think Q1 is the best. So

- 00:21:33.510 stylization, I think Q1 is the best. So I will do reset params to default.

- 00:21:36.070 I will do reset params to default. Direct apply this one. And let's try a

- 00:21:39.190 Direct apply this one. And let's try a nonrealistic image. So let's make the

- 00:21:42.230 nonrealistic image. So let's make the resolution like this. Surprisingly, one

- 00:21:44.870 resolution like this. Surprisingly, one 2.2 also good with nonrealistic images

- 00:21:47.990 2.2 also good with nonrealistic images as well. For example, this one was

- 00:21:50.710 as well. For example, this one was generated on 12.2 or this image was also

- 00:21:54.390 generated on 12.2 or this image was also generated on 12.2. But in my opinion, if

- 00:21:58.470 generated on 12.2. But in my opinion, if your aim is not realism, then QAN may

- 00:22:02.470 your aim is not realism, then QAN may yield better results. This is base one,

- 00:22:05.190 yield better results. This is base one, not upscale it. And this is the quality.

- 00:22:08.230 not upscale it. And this is the quality. So what about image editing? We have

- 00:22:11.110 So what about image editing? We have amazing preset for image editing as

- 00:22:13.029 amazing preset for image editing as well. Reset params to default. And

- 00:22:14.870 well. Reset params to default. And currently best image editing model is

- 00:22:18.950 currently best image editing model is Cuban image edit plus 12 steps. So

- 00:22:23.190 Cuban image edit plus 12 steps. So direct apply. And I am going to edit

- 00:22:25.669 direct apply. And I am going to edit these two images. So I will drag and

- 00:22:28.230 these two images. So I will drag and drop them to here. You see here, not in

- 00:22:31.190 drop them to here. You see here, not in it image. This is important. Then select

- 00:22:34.549 it image. This is important. Then select the aspect ratio that is closer to your

- 00:22:37.909 the aspect ratio that is closer to your input main target image. If you don't

- 00:22:39.909 input main target image. If you don't know it, you can use this strategy.

- 00:22:42.310 know it, you can use this strategy. Choose your main image. Click rest and

- 00:22:44.950 Choose your main image. Click rest and use closest aspect ratio like this. And

- 00:22:47.590 use closest aspect ratio like this. And it will auto set. Or you can use exact

- 00:22:49.669 it will auto set. Or you can use exact aspect ratio as well. Or you can use

- 00:22:52.230 aspect ratio as well. Or you can use resolution as well. So you can compare

- 00:22:54.470 resolution as well. So you can compare all three cases and decide which one is

- 00:22:56.789 all three cases and decide which one is working best. And after that disable

- 00:22:59.190 working best. And after that disable init image. This is important. Then type

- 00:23:01.350 init image. This is important. Then type your prompt. So my prompt will be simple

- 00:23:04.390 your prompt. So my prompt will be simple as this one. Make him wear headphones

- 00:23:09.029 as this one. Make him wear headphones and generate this. Cuban image edit

- 00:23:11.830 and generate this. Cuban image edit model works with commands. So you give a

- 00:23:16.310 model works with commands. So you give a command describe whatever you want and

- 00:23:19.669 command describe whatever you want and just wait the result. This model is

- 00:23:21.990 just wait the result. This model is really really powerful. I already have

- 00:23:23.990 really really powerful. I already have full tutorial for this model. You can

- 00:23:26.549 full tutorial for this model. You can see it here. Nano banana versus Q and

- 00:23:29.909 see it here. Nano banana versus Q and image edit or Cuban image edit full

- 00:23:32.310 image edit or Cuban image edit full tutorial. We also have a newer model

- 00:23:34.390 tutorial. We also have a newer model Cuban image edit plus. I already updated

- 00:23:36.870 Cuban image edit plus. I already updated the model downloader and also the preset

- 00:23:40.230 the model downloader and also the preset for this new model. So even though these

- 00:23:42.390 for this new model. So even though these older tutorials were for the base Cuban

- 00:23:44.870 older tutorials were for the base Cuban image edit model, now we have the latest

- 00:23:47.669 image edit model, now we have the latest Cuban image edit model. Okay, it didn't

- 00:23:50.470 Cuban image edit model. Okay, it didn't understand the prompts. So, let's try

- 00:23:52.630 understand the prompts. So, let's try another prompt. Make him wear the

- 00:23:54.630 another prompt. Make him wear the headphone. This usually never happened

- 00:23:56.789 headphone. This usually never happened to me before, but this time it happened.

- 00:23:59.190 to me before, but this time it happened. So, let's try again. Okay, this time it

- 00:24:01.350 So, let's try again. Okay, this time it is working. So, if you don't get the

- 00:24:03.990 is working. So, if you don't get the output you want at the first time, try

- 00:24:06.950 output you want at the first time, try with a different seat. It will help you.

- 00:24:09.590 with a different seat. It will help you. You see, I am currently trying a

- 00:24:11.110 You see, I am currently trying a different seat. One of the best parts of

- 00:24:13.590 different seat. One of the best parts of the Swarm UI is that you can have

- 00:24:16.630 the Swarm UI is that you can have different presets yourself. You can have

- 00:24:18.549 different presets yourself. You can have wild cards to test different prompts.

- 00:24:20.950 wild cards to test different prompts. For example, I have used a lot of

- 00:24:23.269 For example, I have used a lot of different prompts to generate to show

- 00:24:25.750 different prompts to generate to show you in the beginning. These prompts are

- 00:24:27.990 you in the beginning. These prompts are also shared in the zip file. You will

- 00:24:30.870 also shared in the zip file. You will see that there are some test prompts. So

- 00:24:33.190 see that there are some test prompts. So you can follow these prompts and see

- 00:24:35.669 you can follow these prompts and see which one of them how written they are.

- 00:24:38.310 which one of them how written they are. Okay, this is it. You see we made him

- 00:24:41.190 Okay, this is it. You see we made him wear that specific headphones. This is

- 00:24:43.909 wear that specific headphones. This is the best image editing model. I mean you

- 00:24:46.149 the best image editing model. I mean you can make like this for example make hair

- 00:24:51.029 can make like this for example make hair blue and generate it understands your

- 00:24:54.390 blue and generate it understands your instructions. It is like check GPT image

- 00:24:56.870 instructions. It is like check GPT image editing or nano banana image editing and

- 00:25:00.149 editing or nano banana image editing and this model is really really good. If you

- 00:25:02.390 this model is really really good. If you don't get exact image that you want I

- 00:25:05.269 don't get exact image that you want I mean like pixel distortions or some

- 00:25:07.750 mean like pixel distortions or some other stuff you should try different

- 00:25:09.590 other stuff you should try different aspect ratios from here. You see closest

- 00:25:12.789 aspect ratios from here. You see closest aspect ratio, exact aspect ratio, use

- 00:25:15.110 aspect ratio, exact aspect ratio, use resolution, use exact aspect resolution.

- 00:25:18.149 resolution, use exact aspect resolution. So try all the cases and see which one

- 00:25:20.870 So try all the cases and see which one is yielding the best results. And this

- 00:25:23.430 is yielding the best results. And this is it. So it did the command I made him

- 00:25:27.269 is it. So it did the command I made him to do. So this is all for today. I hope

- 00:25:29.990 to do. So this is all for today. I hope you have enjoyed. Please subscribe,

- 00:25:32.549 you have enjoyed. Please subscribe, leave a like, leave a comment. The links

- 00:25:35.269 leave a like, leave a comment. The links will be in the description of the video.

- 00:25:37.510 will be in the description of the video. And hopefully I will make quick run and

- 00:25:40.149 And hopefully I will make quick run and mass compute tutorials as well to show

- 00:25:42.549 mass compute tutorials as well to show you how to install on cloud. And if you

- 00:25:45.269 you how to install on cloud. And if you don't have a powerful GPU, you will be

- 00:25:47.269 don't have a powerful GPU, you will be able to generate really fast images

- 00:25:49.029 able to generate really fast images there. Moreover, all your images are

- 00:25:51.510 there. Moreover, all your images are saved inside

- 00:25:53.510 saved inside output inside local inside row based on

- 00:25:57.029 output inside local inside row based on date. If you have generated grids based

- 00:25:58.950 date. If you have generated grids based on grid, furthermore, in the image

- 00:26:01.510 on grid, furthermore, in the image history tab, you will see all your

- 00:26:03.669 history tab, you will see all your images. You can filter them by words. It

- 00:26:06.870 images. You can filter them by words. It really works well like eyeglasses

- 00:26:10.310 really works well like eyeglasses and it will show all the prompts that

- 00:26:12.149 and it will show all the prompts that had eyeglasses and you can look each one

- 00:26:15.029 had eyeglasses and you can look each one of them like this one and hopefully see

- 00:26:17.590 of them like this one and hopefully see you
