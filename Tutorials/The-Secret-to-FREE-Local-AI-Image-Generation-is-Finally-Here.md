### Video Transcription


- [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3gEoAyL2IE&t=0) Greetings everyone. Today, I am going to show&nbsp; you state-of-the-art local image generation. It&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3gEoAyL2IE&t=7) is really hard to follow the latest developments&nbsp; in image generation. Moreover, there are so many&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3gEoAyL2IE&t=15) different information, workflows, instructions,&nbsp; but today I will show you literally one click&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3gEoAyL2IE&t=23) to install and generate the very best images&nbsp; strategy. I am going to show you the latest&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3gEoAyL2IE&t=30) state-of-the-art image generation models with&nbsp; presets. When I say preset, it is really,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3gEoAyL2IE&t=37) really a preset. You won't be spending any&nbsp; time to figure out how to make it work. I&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3gEoAyL2IE&t=44) will show you how to generate amazing images for&nbsp; realism and also for stylization with SwarmUI.

- [00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3gEoAyL2IE&t=50) SwarmUI is so much easier to use&nbsp; compared to ComfyUI. However,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3gEoAyL2IE&t=57) it is still leveraging all the optimizations&nbsp; and features of the ComfyUI. Therefore,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3gEoAyL2IE&t=64) currently SwarmUI is the best interface, best&nbsp; application that we can use to generate images.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3gEoAyL2IE&t=72) And you will be surprised that how easy&nbsp; it is to install and set up. I will show&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3gEoAyL2IE&t=78) everything. So whether you are an expert&nbsp; or whether you don't know anything about&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3gEoAyL2IE&t=83) tech and how to install these stuff,&nbsp; this tutorial will show you everything.

- [00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3gEoAyL2IE&t=88) As you can see, these images are amazing&nbsp; quality. Obtaining this quality was not&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3gEoAyL2IE&t=94) easy. I had to do a lot of research. However,&nbsp; I have found the best preset for this. With&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3gEoAyL2IE&t=101) my presets and one-click installers, you will&nbsp; be able to generate these images right away.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3gEoAyL2IE&t=107) It will be so, so easy. Moreover,&nbsp; generating this quality images is&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3gEoAyL2IE&t=114) not requiring a very high-end GPU. All of&nbsp; these images are locally generated in my&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3gEoAyL2IE&t=119) Windows computer with SwarmUI. I mean, look&nbsp; at the realism. This is an ultimate realism&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3gEoAyL2IE&t=125) that we got locally on our Windows PC. So&nbsp; this tutorial will show you everything.

- [00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3gEoAyL2IE&t=131) If you are aiming for realism or stylization,&nbsp; after watching this tutorial, you will be able&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3gEoAyL2IE&t=136) to generate both of them locally with so much&nbsp; easiness that you will be also surprised. So&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3gEoAyL2IE&t=142) how it will work exactly? Let's make a quick&nbsp; demonstration. So this is the SwarmUI interface.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3gEoAyL2IE&t=148) I will do Quick Tools, Reset Params to Default,&nbsp; and I will do this, direct apply. Then I will type&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3gEoAyL2IE&t=155) my prompt, whatever the prompt you want, and hit&nbsp; generate. Then this will generate the base image,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3gEoAyL2IE&t=162) not upscaled image. Moreover, currently&nbsp; it is generating 1 to 1 ratio. Let's say&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3gEoAyL2IE&t=168) I want different ratio, for example, 16&nbsp; to 9. I did set it and hit generate. The&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3gEoAyL2IE&t=175) second one is queued. So after this one is&nbsp; finished, it will generate the second image.

- [00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3gEoAyL2IE&t=180) And you can see live the preview. So this is the&nbsp; image being generated. Therefore, if you don't&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3gEoAyL2IE&t=187) like the image, you can just click this X icon&nbsp; and cancel it. But let's just wait and see. Okay,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3gEoAyL2IE&t=192) this is the first image. If I like this image,&nbsp; next step, I will be upscaling it. Let's see the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3gEoAyL2IE&t=198) second image as well. And as a third image,&nbsp; let's generate a realistic one. For example,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3gEoAyL2IE&t=204) this is the prompt I have. I am using Wan 2.2&nbsp; model right now for generating these images.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3gEoAyL2IE&t=211) Wan 2.2 is normally a video generation model.&nbsp; However, we have figured out a way, a preset,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3gEoAyL2IE&t=220) to generate amazing quality images with&nbsp; Wan 2.2. Okay, this is the second generated&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3gEoAyL2IE&t=226) image. Let's see the third one and then&nbsp; let's upscale one of them. So you see,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3gEoAyL2IE&t=231) this is so easy with my presets. You will get this&nbsp; interface, these presets. You will just apply and&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3gEoAyL2IE&t=238) generate. And this is the third image. Let's say I&nbsp; liked this image. So I will say Reuse Parameters,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3gEoAyL2IE&t=245) then in the presets, we have image upscale.&nbsp; You see upscale images, direct apply, and&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3gEoAyL2IE&t=253) generate. Now it will upscale this image into 4x&nbsp; resolution. The width and height will be double,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3gEoAyL2IE&t=261) so it will be 4x. And we have so many amazing&nbsp; presets. You see? After you followed this&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3gEoAyL2IE&t=268) tutorial, you will have all these presets and&nbsp; you will be able to use any of them as you wish.

- [00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3gEoAyL2IE&t=273) Now it is generating the base image, then&nbsp; it will upscale it and it will add a huge&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3gEoAyL2IE&t=278) amount of details. You will be shocked by it.&nbsp; And one of the best part of SwarmUI is that it&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3gEoAyL2IE&t=284) is using ComfyUI as a backend. Therefore,&nbsp; it will do automatically block swapping,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3gEoAyL2IE&t=291) CPU offloading, VAE tiling. So it will do all&nbsp; the optimizations according to your hardware,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3gEoAyL2IE&t=297) like your RAM amount, like your VRAM&nbsp; amount, like your GPU model. It will&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3gEoAyL2IE&t=302) be all automatically done. 4x image upscaling&nbsp; will take four times compared to generating&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3gEoAyL2IE&t=309) base image because basically, we are&nbsp; generating four times more pixels.

- [00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3gEoAyL2IE&t=314) Upscale completed and let's look at the details.&nbsp; I mean, look at this realism, these details.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3gEoAyL2IE&t=320) This image is just amazing. When we compare to&nbsp; the base image, this was the image resolution,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3gEoAyL2IE&t=327) the quality, the details, and this is the new&nbsp; image. You may notice that the image changed&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3gEoAyL2IE&t=333) slightly more than what we expect. We can prevent&nbsp; it. You can reduce the refiner control percentage,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3gEoAyL2IE&t=340) which will be automatically enabled in here. So&nbsp; if you make this lesser, like 50 percentage, it&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3gEoAyL2IE&t=346) will change image lesser degree. It is up to you.&nbsp; So based on your needs, you can reduce this and&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3gEoAyL2IE&t=353) it will make it more like the base image, maybe&nbsp; a little bit lesser degree of adding new details.

- [00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3gEoAyL2IE&t=361) So how easy and how to install SwarmUI, these&nbsp; presets, ComfyUI backend? So easy. First of all,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3gEoAyL2IE&t=370) we are going to install ComfyUI. You will&nbsp; find this link in the description of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3gEoAyL2IE&t=375) video and also in the comment section of the&nbsp; video. Always download the latest zip file.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3gEoAyL2IE&t=381) And as you scroll down, you will see the&nbsp; change logs. You can read them to learn,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3gEoAyL2IE&t=386) but one thing is important, you need&nbsp; to follow Windows requirements tutorial&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3gEoAyL2IE&t=392) before starting installation. This is one&nbsp; time mandatory and after that you will be&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3gEoAyL2IE&t=397) able to run all the AI applications without&nbsp; following this again. This is just one time.

- [00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3gEoAyL2IE&t=403) First, I will show a fresh installation. So I&nbsp; will install it into my Q drive and right click&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3gEoAyL2IE&t=409) and extract all like this. Make sure that&nbsp; your folder name doesn't have any special&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3gEoAyL2IE&t=415) characters or any space characters. All I need&nbsp; to do is just Windows install or update ComfyUI&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3gEoAyL2IE&t=421) and run. And then according to your Python&nbsp; version, select it. I still recommend Python&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3gEoAyL2IE&t=427) 3.10.11. So I will choose the option 1, but we&nbsp; support all these. My installer will install&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3gEoAyL2IE&t=434) it with SAGE attention, FlashAttention, Triton,&nbsp; xFormers. Everything is pre-compiled. Moreover,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3gEoAyL2IE&t=441) it will automatically install ComfyUI&nbsp; Manager, ComfyUI IPAdapter, ComfyUI GGUF,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3gEoAyL2IE&t=447) and Res4LYF. Furthermore, if you need Reactor or&nbsp; Impact Pack extensions, you can just run their bat&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3gEoAyL2IE&t=457) files after installation has been completed,&nbsp; but you don't need it for this tutorial.

- [00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3gEoAyL2IE&t=462) So what if you need to update your existing&nbsp; ComfyUI? But be careful that you had to have&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3gEoAyL2IE&t=468) installed my ComfyUI, not other installations.&nbsp; Enter inside your previous ComfyUI folder,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3gEoAyL2IE&t=475) paste the zip file, make sure to quit from&nbsp; your running application if you have any,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3gEoAyL2IE&t=482) then right click and extract&nbsp; all. I am using WinRAR,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3gEoAyL2IE&t=485) you can use anything. Overwrite all the&nbsp; files that are updated. Then double click&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3gEoAyL2IE&t=490) Windows install or update ComfyUI and run.&nbsp; When you're updating previous installation,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3gEoAyL2IE&t=496) it will be really fast. Just follow the speed&nbsp; here. You see, this is updating right now. Okay,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3gEoAyL2IE&t=502) updating. It should be done under 1 minute&nbsp; in total time. Okay, still updating,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3gEoAyL2IE&t=508) almost done. We are getting there. Yes, updated.&nbsp; It took like 30 seconds to update the ComfyUI to&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3gEoAyL2IE&t=515) the latest version with the newest stuff that we&nbsp; need. This is how my ComfyUI installation works.

- [00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3gEoAyL2IE&t=522) Okay, the fresh installation also completed.&nbsp; It took few minutes. You can scroll up to see&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3gEoAyL2IE&t=528) whether there are any errors or not. There&nbsp; shouldn't be any errors. Once you see that,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3gEoAyL2IE&t=533) press any key to continue. You are done with the&nbsp; ComfyUI installation. As a next step, we are going&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3gEoAyL2IE&t=539) to install SwarmUI. The link of this post will be&nbsp; also in the description of the video and also in&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3gEoAyL2IE&t=545) the comment section, the pinned comment. Download&nbsp; the latest SwarmUI model downloader zip file. Move&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3gEoAyL2IE&t=551) it into the disk wherever you want to install.&nbsp; So I will install into my Q drive. Extract it,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3gEoAyL2IE&t=558) then you will see that there is Windows install&nbsp; SwarmUI.bat file. Double click, run. This&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3gEoAyL2IE&t=564) will install the latest version of the SwarmUI.&nbsp; SwarmUI installation is also lightning fast. Okay,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3gEoAyL2IE&t=572) it is getting there. Yes, started. Now follow&nbsp; my steps exactly. I agree. Customize settings,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3gEoAyL2IE&t=580) not just install. Yes, we can say yes. Choose your&nbsp; theme. Okay, next, next. Now this is important. We&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3gEoAyL2IE&t=588) are not going to use ComfyUI local. Okay, this is&nbsp; super important because this ComfyUI version is&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3gEoAyL2IE&t=594) very weak and problematic. We are going to&nbsp; use the ComfyUI we just installed. This is&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3gEoAyL2IE&t=599) mandatory. So select none, next. You can download&nbsp; the models that you want. I'm not going to. Next,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3gEoAyL2IE&t=605) and yes, I am sure. You see, it is instant,&nbsp; instantly installed. Then we are going to go&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3gEoAyL2IE&t=611) to server tab, backends, and we are going to&nbsp; add ComfyUI self-starting. Okay. You see now&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3gEoAyL2IE&t=619) this screen has arrived. We are going&nbsp; to add our ComfyUI folder path here.

- [00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3gEoAyL2IE&t=625) So I had installed it into my Q drive, which&nbsp; is inside here. ComfyUI, copy this path,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3gEoAyL2IE&t=632) and then backslash main.py. So then you can also&nbsp; give some extra arguments. What kind of extra&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3gEoAyL2IE&t=640) arguments? For example, in the ComfyUI post,&nbsp; you will see that there is like reserve VRAM,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3gEoAyL2IE&t=646) use SAGE attention, GPU only. This is for&nbsp; very high VRAM GPUs. High VRAM. There are&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3gEoAyL2IE&t=652) more options of ComfyUI, but I am going&nbsp; to use SAGE attention. The rest can be&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3gEoAyL2IE&t=658) default. This SAGE attention will improve my&nbsp; performance significantly. Save. In some models,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3gEoAyL2IE&t=667) this can produce black output. If you get black&nbsp; output, just edit here and delete this. Otherwise,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3gEoAyL2IE&t=675) you can keep it. And currently it is going to&nbsp; use my first GPU. If you have multiple GPUs,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3gEoAyL2IE&t=681) you can add another backend like this. Copy this,&nbsp; paste, then select the GPU ID 1. You can use extra&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3gEoAyL2IE&t=690) arguments, save. So now when I generate two&nbsp; images, it will generate on each GPU. Moreover,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3gEoAyL2IE&t=697) I also recommend overQueue to zero. So it&nbsp; will immediately start on the next available&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3gEoAyL2IE&t=704) GPU without waiting. So these are the settings&nbsp; that I am using. I don't change anything else.

- [00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3gEoAyL2IE&t=710) And when I start the SwarmUI again next time,&nbsp; it will also automatically update my ComfyUI.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3gEoAyL2IE&t=715) You can see that there is always auto-update of&nbsp; the backend. If you get update errors, which you&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3gEoAyL2IE&t=721) shouldn't, you can manually update the ComfyUI&nbsp; because we have updater. You see, we just run&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3gEoAyL2IE&t=727) this. For SwarmUI update, we have Windows update&nbsp; SwarmUI. Let me show you that too. So, okay, it is&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3gEoAyL2IE&t=734) started, so I will just close this. Double click&nbsp; Windows update SwarmUI.bat file. It will start&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3gEoAyL2IE&t=740) right away. You see, it is starting, and yes.&nbsp; Now I need to wait again for backends to load.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3gEoAyL2IE&t=747) So currently, in my installation, there is no&nbsp; presets here. How am I going to use the presets?

- [00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3gEoAyL2IE&t=755) We have preset installer. You can use both&nbsp; ways. When you use the preset installer here,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3gEoAyL2IE&t=761) windows_preset_delete_import.bat file, it&nbsp; will delete your older presets and import&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3gEoAyL2IE&t=767) new ones. But don't worry, your older presets&nbsp; will be saved in preset backup. Currently,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3gEoAyL2IE&t=774) since I don't have any presets, they are&nbsp; not saved anywhere. Then I need to click&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3gEoAyL2IE&t=780) refresh and all presets arrived. So&nbsp; now you are ready to use like this.

- [00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3gEoAyL2IE&t=786) And if you want to update your previous SwarmUI&nbsp; installation instead of a fresh installation,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3gEoAyL2IE&t=791) go to the folder, extract zip file, right click&nbsp; and extract all files here. You can use Windows&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3gEoAyL2IE&t=798) extract system or whatever. Overwrite&nbsp; all files. Then it is same, you just&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3gEoAyL2IE&t=803) need to import new presets. You can import new&nbsp; presets from here, import presets, choose file.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3gEoAyL2IE&t=811) So this is manual way. Choose the preset&nbsp; file, overwrite existing presets and import,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3gEoAyL2IE&t=817) and it will import existing presets for you. Then&nbsp; click refresh. We have made a fresh installation,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3gEoAyL2IE&t=824) but we are lacking the models. When I&nbsp; go to models, there are no models here,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3gEoAyL2IE&t=829) or there are no LoRAs here. How you are going to&nbsp; find these models? I made it so easy as well. So&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3gEoAyL2IE&t=835) this was our fresh installation and you see there&nbsp; is windows_start_model_downloader_app.bat file.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3gEoAyL2IE&t=842) Double click it, click run. It will start our&nbsp; model downloader application. This application&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3gEoAyL2IE&t=848) is amazing, you will see it. It will also generate&nbsp; a virtual environment. All my installers generates&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3gEoAyL2IE&t=854) a virtual environment and installs everything&nbsp; there. So your installed ComfyUI will never&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3gEoAyL2IE&t=860) break anything else. You can have multiple ComfyUI&nbsp; installations. All will be independent. You see&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3gEoAyL2IE&t=865) when I enter inside ComfyUI, there is virtual&nbsp; environment. So everything is installed here,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3gEoAyL2IE&t=870) nowhere else. So I can have as many&nbsp; as different ComfyUIs that I want.

- [00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3gEoAyL2IE&t=874) Okay, it is getting started. Yes. So this is our&nbsp; model downloader interface. For this tutorial, we&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3gEoAyL2IE&t=882) are going to use SwarmUI bundles, Image Generation&nbsp; and Editing bundle. This will have QWEN Image&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3gEoAyL2IE&t=888) Edit Plus, QWEN Image, best upscaler models, face&nbsp; segmentation models, Wan 2.2 text-to-video model.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3gEoAyL2IE&t=897) This is what we are going to use. Flux SRPO model,&nbsp; this is best Flux realism model, and the other&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3gEoAyL2IE&t=905) needed files. So just click this and follow the&nbsp; CMD window. This downloader is extremely robust.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3gEoAyL2IE&t=913) It will download and do hash calculation.&nbsp; Therefore, all the downloaded models will&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3gEoAyL2IE&t=919) be verified, 100% accurate. There can be never&nbsp; any corrupted downloaded model file with this&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3gEoAyL2IE&t=926) downloader. The logic of this downloader is that&nbsp; it is like you get. If you have used you-get, you&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3gEoAyL2IE&t=933) will know it. So when I go back to my models&nbsp; folder into diffusion models, this is usually&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3gEoAyL2IE&t=938) where the models downloaded. You see that it is&nbsp; 16 parts. So it is downloading with 16 different&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3gEoAyL2IE&t=945) connections. Therefore, it is super fast. You see,&nbsp; my speed is over 100 megabytes per second on my&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3gEoAyL2IE&t=952) personal computer. On cloud machines, this is 300,&nbsp; 400 megabytes. When I go to Task Manager and my&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3gEoAyL2IE&t=958) internet connection, you can see that it is using&nbsp; 1 gigabit. This is my internet speed. Therefore,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3gEoAyL2IE&t=963) it is maximum utilizing it. Once these model&nbsp; downloads completed, it will merge these&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3gEoAyL2IE&t=970) files into a single file and it has a full resume&nbsp; capability. So I will close this to show you. Then&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3gEoAyL2IE&t=977) start the Windows Start Models Downloader file&nbsp; like this. Then I will click the SwarmUI bundles,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3gEoAyL2IE&t=984) download image generation and editing bundle. And&nbsp; you see, it is continuing wherever it is left.

- [00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3gEoAyL2IE&t=990) Believe me, this application took a lot of time&nbsp; of me to develop and this is version 85 right now.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3gEoAyL2IE&t=996) So when you go to URL downloader, you can also&nbsp; download models from this interface. For example,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3gEoAyL2IE&t=1003) let's download this Flux model. Copy this URL,&nbsp; then paste the model URL here, and select the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3gEoAyL2IE&t=1010) target folder. Since this is Flux model, let's&nbsp; see, this is a Flux pruned fp8 model. So this&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3gEoAyL2IE&t=1017) goes into models, diffusion models. Then click&nbsp; download. It will automatically start downloading&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3gEoAyL2IE&t=1023) this model as well. However, currently we are&nbsp; downloading other models, so it will show both&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3gEoAyL2IE&t=1029) of them at the same time, but it is so easy.&nbsp; You can also provide your own Civitai key or&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3gEoAyL2IE&t=1036) Hugging Face API key, but we have some default&nbsp; keys, so you don't need to provide them. So&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3gEoAyL2IE&t=1042) this URL downloader is also extremely useful,&nbsp; especially on cloud machines, on cloud services.

- [00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3gEoAyL2IE&t=1048) So you see this model file has been downloaded,&nbsp; QWEN Image Edit Plus, and it has been merged.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3gEoAyL2IE&t=1054) Now it is downloading the other files. And&nbsp; when you next time start the application,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3gEoAyL2IE&t=1059) the verified downloaded files will be just&nbsp; skipped. It will not re-download them,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3gEoAyL2IE&t=1065) or if the download has been&nbsp; interrupted, it will resume.

- [00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3gEoAyL2IE&t=1068) And the rest is as I have shown in the beginning.&nbsp; I have returned back to my other installation&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3gEoAyL2IE&t=1074) where I have all the downloaded model files, as&nbsp; you can see right now. Before using any preset,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3gEoAyL2IE&t=1081) make sure that click Quick Tools, Reset Params to&nbsp; Default. So it will default all the parameters.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3gEoAyL2IE&t=1088) Then go to preset and use whatever you want. For&nbsp; example, let's use the QWEN Image Realism. This&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3gEoAyL2IE&t=1095) has significantly improved my quality with&nbsp; QWEN LoRA. I will show hopefully soon it,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3gEoAyL2IE&t=1101) training QWEN LoRA. Direct apply and paste&nbsp; your prompt. Then select the aspect ratio&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3gEoAyL2IE&t=1107) that you want. This is also really fast. It&nbsp; is only eight steps, but normally I recommend&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3gEoAyL2IE&t=1113) QWEN for stylized images. So for stylized&nbsp; images, you can use this preset rather than&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3gEoAyL2IE&t=1120) this one. For realism currently I recommend Wan&nbsp; 2.2 image realism preset, and for best quality,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3gEoAyL2IE&t=1127) I recommend you to upscale images to 2x. Actually,&nbsp; it is 4x resolution in total. So we are getting&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3gEoAyL2IE&t=1134) the QWEN image result. I will also show you&nbsp; Flux SRPO. It is also a really realistic model.

- [00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3gEoAyL2IE&t=1142) So let's see the results of each one. You see&nbsp; the QWEN is really fast and this is a really&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3gEoAyL2IE&t=1147) high resolution, it is almost 2 megapixels.&nbsp; Okay, the image has been generated. It is not&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3gEoAyL2IE&t=1151) very realistic. The QWEN is not very realistic.&nbsp; This is the realism we got, but this is what QWEN&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3gEoAyL2IE&t=1158) is. Hopefully, you will see that it is way more&nbsp; realistic with self LoRA training. So let's try&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3gEoAyL2IE&t=1163) this with Flux SRPO. Quick Tools, Reset Params to&nbsp; Default, then direct apply. This will select the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3gEoAyL2IE&t=1171) Flux base model by default. Therefore, you need&nbsp; to select Flux SRPO yourself like this. You see&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3gEoAyL2IE&t=1177) the selected model is now Flux SRPO. Paste your&nbsp; prompt, select your aspect ratio, okay, here,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3gEoAyL2IE&t=1184) and generate. Flux SRPO is also really fast to&nbsp; generate. Now it is reloading my model. One of&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3gEoAyL2IE&t=1190) the best part of my preset system is that you can&nbsp; test all of them so quickly, compare, and decide&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3gEoAyL2IE&t=1198) which one is working best for your case. If you&nbsp; remember, this image was really, really realistic&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3gEoAyL2IE&t=1203) on Wan 2.2 preset. So for realism, currently Wan&nbsp; 2.2 image realism is my number one choice, and&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3gEoAyL2IE&t=1212) Flux SRPO is my second choice, which we are about&nbsp; to see. And this is not upscaled, remember we need&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3gEoAyL2IE&t=1219) to upscale for even better. Yes, this is Flux&nbsp; SRPO. It is also really realistic. If we upscale&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3gEoAyL2IE&t=1226) this image, it will become much better. So reuse&nbsp; parameters, direct apply the upscale. You will&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3gEoAyL2IE&t=1231) notice that it has enabled upscale and generate.&nbsp; Now we will get much better quality image.

- [00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3gEoAyL2IE&t=1238) If you also don't have a powerful GPU and you want&nbsp; to use cloud services like RunPod or MassCompute,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3gEoAyL2IE&t=1244) I will make separate tutorials to show how to&nbsp; install and use there. Moreover, I already also&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3gEoAyL2IE&t=1251) have some tutorials for RunPod and MassCompute.&nbsp; For example, this tutorial is made for RunPod,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3gEoAyL2IE&t=1257) so you can watch this to learn how to install&nbsp; ComfyUI and SwarmUI. And this tutorial is showing&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3gEoAyL2IE&t=1263) you how to install new ComfyUI on MassCompute&nbsp; and use the existing SwarmUI there. So we already&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3gEoAyL2IE&t=1271) have tutorials, but I plan to make specific&nbsp; tutorials for this one as well, for today's&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3gEoAyL2IE&t=1277) tutorial as well. Okay, now I have upscaled&nbsp; the image. So from this image to this image,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3gEoAyL2IE&t=1283) we got it. So it is up to you, you can try, see&nbsp; which one is working best for your case. And for&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3gEoAyL2IE&t=1289) stylization, I think QWEN is the best. So I will&nbsp; do reset params to default, direct apply this one,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3gEoAyL2IE&t=1298) and let's try a non-realistic image. So let's&nbsp; make the resolution like this. Surprisingly, Wan&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3gEoAyL2IE&t=1304) 2.2 also good with non-realistic images as well.&nbsp; For example, this one was generated on Wan 2.2,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3gEoAyL2IE&t=1312) or this image was also generated on Wan 2.2.&nbsp; But in my opinion, if your aim is not realism,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3gEoAyL2IE&t=1320) then QWEN may yield better results. This is&nbsp; base one, not upscaled, and this is the quality.

- [00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3gEoAyL2IE&t=1328) So what about image editing? We have amazing&nbsp; preset for image editing as well. Reset params&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3gEoAyL2IE&t=1333) to default. And currently, best image editing&nbsp; model is QWEN Image Edit Plus 12 steps. So direct&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3gEoAyL2IE&t=1343) apply. And I am going to edit these two images. So&nbsp; I will drag and drop them to here. You see, here,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3gEoAyL2IE&t=1350) not init image. This is important. Then select&nbsp; the aspect ratio that is closer to your input&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3gEoAyL2IE&t=1358) main target image. If you don't know it, you&nbsp; can use this strategy. Choose your main image,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3gEoAyL2IE&t=1363) click res, and use closest aspect ratio like&nbsp; this, and it will auto-set. Or you can use exact&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3gEoAyL2IE&t=1369) aspect ratio as well, or you can use resolution&nbsp; as well. So you can compare all three cases and&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3gEoAyL2IE&t=1375) decide which one is working best. And after that,&nbsp; disable init image. This is important. Then type&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3gEoAyL2IE&t=1381) your prompt. So my prompt will be simple as this&nbsp; one. Make him wear headphones and generate. This&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3gEoAyL2IE&t=1390) QWEN Image Edit model works with commands. So&nbsp; you give a command, describe whatever you want,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3gEoAyL2IE&t=1399) and just wait the result. This model is really,&nbsp; really powerful. I already have full tutorial&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3gEoAyL2IE&t=1404) for this model. You can see it here, Nano Banana&nbsp; versus QWEN Image Edit or QWEN Image Edit full&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3gEoAyL2IE&t=1412) tutorial. We also have a newer model, QWEN&nbsp; Image Edit Plus. I already updated the model&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3gEoAyL2IE&t=1417) downloader and also the preset for this new&nbsp; model. So even though these older tutorials&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3gEoAyL2IE&t=1423) were for the base QWEN Image Edit model, now&nbsp; we have the latest QWEN Image Edit model.

- [00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3gEoAyL2IE&t=1429) Okay, it didn't understand the prompt. So let's&nbsp; try another prompt. Make him wear the headphone.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3gEoAyL2IE&t=1435) This usually never happened to me before, but&nbsp; this time it happened. So let's try again. Okay,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3gEoAyL2IE&t=1440) this time it is working. So if you don't&nbsp; get the output you want at the first time,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3gEoAyL2IE&t=1446) try with a different seed. It will help you.&nbsp; You see, I am currently trying a different&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3gEoAyL2IE&t=1451) seed. One of the best parts of the SwarmUI is&nbsp; that you can have different presets yourself,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3gEoAyL2IE&t=1458) you can have wildcards to test different&nbsp; prompts. For example, I have used a lot of&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3gEoAyL2IE&t=1463) different prompts to generate to show you in&nbsp; the beginning. These prompts are also shared&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3gEoAyL2IE&t=1468) in the zip file. You will see that there&nbsp; are some test prompts. So you can follow&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3gEoAyL2IE&t=1474) these prompts and see which one of them, how&nbsp; written they are. Okay, this is it. You see,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3gEoAyL2IE&t=1480) we made him wear that specific headphones.&nbsp; This is the best image editing model. I mean,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3gEoAyL2IE&t=1485) you can make like this, for example, make&nbsp; hair blue and generate. It understands your&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3gEoAyL2IE&t=1494) instructions. It is like ChatGPT image editing&nbsp; or Nano Banana image editing. And this model is&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3gEoAyL2IE&t=1500) really, really good. If you don't get exact image&nbsp; that you want, I mean like pixel distortions or&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3gEoAyL2IE&t=1507) some other stuff, you should try different aspect&nbsp; ratios from here. You see, closest aspect ratio,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3gEoAyL2IE&t=1513) exact aspect ratio, use resolution, use exact&nbsp; aspect resolution. So try all the cases and see&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3gEoAyL2IE&t=1520) which one is yielding the best results. And this&nbsp; is it. So it did the command I made him to do.

- [00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3gEoAyL2IE&t=1528) So this is all for today. I hope you have enjoyed.&nbsp; Please subscribe, leave a like, leave a comment.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3gEoAyL2IE&t=1534) The links will be in the description of the&nbsp; video. And hopefully I will make quick RunPod&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3gEoAyL2IE&t=1539) and MassCompute tutorials as well to show you&nbsp; how to install on cloud. And if you don't have a&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3gEoAyL2IE&t=1545) powerful GPU, you will be able to generate really&nbsp; fast images there. Moreover, all your images are&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3gEoAyL2IE&t=1551) saved inside SwarmUI, inside output, inside local,&nbsp; inside raw, based on date. If you have generated&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3gEoAyL2IE&t=1558) grids, based on grid. Furthermore, in the image&nbsp; history tab, you will see all your images. You&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3gEoAyL2IE&t=1564) can filter them by words. It really works well.&nbsp; Like eyeglasses, and it will show all the prompts&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3gEoAyL2IE&t=1572) that had eyeglasses. And you can look each one of&nbsp; them like this one. And hopefully, see you later.
