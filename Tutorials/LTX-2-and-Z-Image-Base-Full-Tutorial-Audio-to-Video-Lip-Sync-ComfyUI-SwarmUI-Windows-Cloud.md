- [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=0) Greetings everyone. Today I am going to show&nbsp; you LTX 2 workflows, presets in ComfyUI. I

- [00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=7) have prepared all the configurations, one&nbsp; click to install and use. Moreover, I will

- [00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=12) show Z-Image base model in ComfyUI. Moreover, I&nbsp; will show you how to use the LTX 2 in our famous

- [00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=21) SwarmUI with presets, Z-Image base in SwarmUI&nbsp; with presets. Furthermore, I will show you how

- [00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=28) to improve your prompts in Google AI Studio for&nbsp; free with our prepared commands file. Moreover,

- [00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=36) downloading these preset models will be&nbsp; one click with our interface updated model

- [00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=42) downloader. This is independent from both ComfyUI&nbsp; and SwarmUI. It has both Z-Image and LTX 2 models.

- [00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=51) I also have prepared Z-Image Quant FP8 scaled&nbsp; model for you and also working on NVFP4 models

- [00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=59) and NVFP4 generator. This application will have&nbsp; everything SECourses Musubi Trainer. It will

- [00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=66) have all the options to quantize your models.&nbsp; Also, I will make fresh installation on RunPod,

- [00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=73) Massed Compute, and SimplePod so that we will&nbsp; refresh our memory to how to install and use

- [00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=80) ComfyUI and SwarmUI on cloud platforms in&nbsp; addition to your local Windows computer.

- [00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=86) I am going to show you an amazing workflow&nbsp; in ComfyUI which you can provide your audio,

- [00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=92) image, prompt and generate amazing audio driven

- [00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=95) video. It has lip sync and it has&nbsp; animation. Let me demonstrate you.

- [00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=100) SECourses. Let's go. Late night screen glow. Ideas&nbsp; on fire. Turning what if into something higher.

- [00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=108) From zero to flow. We learn it fast. Build it&nbsp; ship it make the future last. New tools new

- [00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=113) rules we break the doubt. Take that prompt watch&nbsp; the AI route. If you want the shortcuts done the

- [00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=117) right way. Hit play let's level up today. Hands&nbsp; on the keyboard mind on the dream. Watch the

- [00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=122) model run like a laser beam. No fear no fluff just&nbsp; clarity. One more step to your next victory. SECourses

- [00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=128) AI on the rise. Lighting up the dark&nbsp; with electric skies. From prompts to pixels

- [00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=133) code to sound. We make it real we run this ground.&nbsp; That's courses learn build repeat. Turn big ideas

- [00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=139) into something elite. If you want the best place&nbsp; to start. That's courses straight to the heart.

- [00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=145) As you have seen it was amazing video. It was&nbsp; 45 seconds. After like 30 seconds 35 seconds

- [00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=152) it starts to degrade but this is what LTX 2&nbsp; can do. This will be literally one click to

- [00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=159) install and use. I will show that. So here&nbsp; another example in ComfyUI. This is image

- [00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=163) to video workflow. It is also one click to use&nbsp; and I will show in SwarmUI as well. Let's see.

- [00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=170) This is the tutorial that you&nbsp; have been waiting for so long.

- [00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=173) I mean amazing. You see it did a very&nbsp; nice emotion at the end. The LTX video

- [00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=179) can generate up to 20 seconds very&nbsp; good. It can generate up to 1 minute

- [00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=183) but after 20 seconds it starts to&nbsp; degrade. Let's see text to video.

- [00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=193) You took a wrong turn partner.

- [00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=198) By the way these were quick demos that I&nbsp; did. They are not perfect. They are not

- [00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=202) cherry picked. And this is Z-Image workflow.&nbsp; This is an amazing quality. So many people

- [00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=209) is not using accurately and as you see this is&nbsp; what kind of quality Z-Image base can generate

- [00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=215) in ComfyUI. All is preset I will show. Now let&nbsp; me show you the examples on the SwarmUI. This

- [00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=223) is image to video in SwarmUI. It is so easy to&nbsp; use with our preset. I will show how to use.

- [00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=229) This is the tutorial that you&nbsp; have been waiting for so long.

- [00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=238) As you have seen it is amazing.&nbsp; These are quick demos so you can

- [00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=242) generate even much better videos. So here&nbsp; another example in SwarmUI. This is video.

- [00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=252) Faith falls! Witness me!

- [00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=257) With video upscalers they would become much better&nbsp; or with more tries or improving the text prompt.

- [00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=264) These are quick demos. And we have the Z-Image&nbsp; base preset in SwarmUI as well. It is working

- [00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=270) amazing. Amazing quality, amazing realism and&nbsp; it is following the prompts very well very good.

- [00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=276) So you should begin with upgrading your ComfyUI&nbsp; if you haven't yet or download the latest zip

- [00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=281) file to obtain the all the presets that we&nbsp; have. So the link will be in the description

- [00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=286) of the video. Download the latest zip file&nbsp; version 78. It can be bigger version when

- [00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=291) you are watching this tutorial. Then copy&nbsp; the downloaded zip file. Go to your ComfyUI

- [00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=296) installation or into a fresh folder. Both works.&nbsp; Then you need to extract archive and overwrite all

- [00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=304) the files. This is really important. Overwrite&nbsp; all. Then if you didn't upgrade to CUDA 13 yet,

- [00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=311) enter inside ComfyUI, delete your virtual&nbsp; environment folder like this. This is proper

- [00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=317) way of upgrading CUDA 13 if you haven't yet.&nbsp; Since my ComfyUI is open it is preventing me

- [00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=323) to delete the virtual environment folder. So&nbsp; let me delete all of them. Try again. Deleting

- [00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=329) virtual environment will not cause you to lose&nbsp; any data. Then install or update ComfyUI run.

- [00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=336) This is not mandatory every time. This is&nbsp; mandatory when you are upgrading from CUDA

- [00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=340) 12.9. So I am using Python 3.10. You need to have&nbsp; this installed in your computer. And this is the

- [00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=347) version that I recommend. This is same for fresh&nbsp; installation and upgrade. We use the same file.

- [00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=354) If you are first time into generative AI you&nbsp; really should follow Windows requirements

- [00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=360) tutorial. When you scroll down a little bit&nbsp; you will see this. We have a up to date video

- [00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=366) here so watch it and we have an up to date&nbsp; post which you will follow while you are

- [00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=372) watching this tutorial video. It has all the&nbsp; links instructions. It is fully up to date.

- [00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=377) Last time updated is 8 January 2026. I&nbsp; am using exactly as in here so this is

- [00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=386) identical to my setup so therefore when&nbsp; you watch this tutorial all of the AI

- [00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=391) applications will work on your PC perfectly&nbsp; fine on your computer perfectly fine.

- [00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=396) So the ComfyUI installation and update has been&nbsp; completed. To use the newest presets you need to

- [00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=402) use the Windows custom nodes bundles installer.&nbsp; Double click it. This is a unified bundles

- [00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=409) installer that I have made for you. So you need&nbsp; to install option 1 SwarmUI extra nodes to use

- [00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=415) the presets. Plus you need to install bundle 100&nbsp; LTX audio to video bundle. So when you install

- [00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=422) these two you will be ready. So 1 and comma and&nbsp; 100 and hit enter. It will ask you to proceed.

- [00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=429) You can hit Y or enter and it will install the&nbsp; necessary bundles and update them. So this is for

- [00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=436) both update and installation. This covers both&nbsp; of them. You see it is updating my bundles as

- [00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=442) well and it is all getting updated. Okay all the&nbsp; nodes have been installed or updated properly.

- [00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=449) Then I also have added&nbsp; windows_run_vram_optimized.bat

- [00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=454) file. When you run this it will ask you to start&nbsp; your installation with specific configuration.

- [00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=460) So if you are getting out of VRAM options&nbsp; you can do this. You can start with no VRAM

- [00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=466) mode. When you do this you can even generate 1&nbsp; minute videos on LTX 2. This will use very very

- [00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=472) minimal amount of VRAM memory. Actually let me&nbsp; demonstrate you. So you see currently I am using

- [00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=477) 2 megabytes of VRAM. So I will choose the option&nbsp; 5. And if you are also low on RAM memory you can

- [00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=484) start with no cache. So it is option 3. You can&nbsp; also disable smart memory. So let's disable as

- [00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=492) well. And it will be GPU default or you can&nbsp; also choose VAE on CPU. I will make it GPU.

- [00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=499) I am going to use Sage Attention. You shouldn't&nbsp; use Sage Attention for Z-Image base model at the

- [00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=504) moment but for all other models you should&nbsp; use it. Currently Z-Image base model is not

- [00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=509) working with Sage Attention. And the precision&nbsp; I am going to just make it auto. And for this

- [00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=514) option just hit yes. Additional optimizations I&nbsp; am just going to leave it auto. Disable pinned

- [00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=521) memory no. And it is all done. So you see it&nbsp; shows you the configuration options. You can

- [00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=528) do this if you don't want to pick these every&nbsp; time. Copy this windows run GPU and paste. So

- [00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=535) you see I have copied version. Right click edit in&nbsp; Notepad++. So you can append these options to here

- [00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=544) like this. You see or like this. So this way you&nbsp; can customize your starting bat file and use it

- [00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=553) to start directly with all these optimizations&nbsp; you want. This is also how you remove the sage

- [00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=561) attention from run GPU here. So you can also&nbsp; edit this file and remove the Sage Attention

- [00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=570) from here to start without Sage Attention. This&nbsp; is how you customize your starting with ComfyUI.

- [00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=576) Moreover to use the SwarmUI downloaded models you&nbsp; need to do this. Copy extra model paths into your

- [00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=583) ComfyUI folder. Then right click and edit it.&nbsp; Then select the models base path. This is where

- [00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=591) I have downloaded all of my models so therefore&nbsp; when I give this it sees all the models inside

- [00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=597) my SwarmUI installation folder or wherever I&nbsp; want. You can add multiple base paths to here.

- [00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=604) Okay so the ComfyUI started with the minimal&nbsp; amount of VRAM memory usage. So let me show you

- [00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=611) 45 seconds audio to video generation. I have the&nbsp; preset here. How you are going to use them? You

- [00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=618) need to first download the models. To download the&nbsp; models we are going to use the model downloader

- [00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=625) which is included in SwarmUI model downloader&nbsp; zip file. This is also how we are going to

- [00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=629) install SwarmUI updated and get the presets.&nbsp; So let's download this. The link will be in

- [00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=634) the description of the video. So move the SwarmUI&nbsp; model downloader into your SwarmUI installation

- [00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=640) or into any drive make a fresh installation.&nbsp; Right click. Then you need to extract here and

- [00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=646) overwrite all the files. This is super important.&nbsp; Overwrite all the files so that it will update the

- [00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=653) utilities and everything. Then double click&nbsp; Windows start download models application

- [00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=657) file. Independent from SwarmUI. You don't need to&nbsp; install SwarmUI for this. This supports ComfyUI

- [00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=665) as well. So this is our new interface. This is&nbsp; where you give the base model path. So you see

- [00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=671) currently it is seeing automatically my SwarmUI&nbsp; models. You can change this into your ComfyUI

- [00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=677) models as well. So enter inside here. Go to&nbsp; the models and copy the path. Copy paste it

- [00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=684) here. You can also remember settings. And ComfyUI&nbsp; folder structure. Then you need to download the

- [00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=690) LTX 2 video core bundle or Z-Image core bundle&nbsp; if you want to use them. But I am using SwarmUI

- [00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=698) mainly therefore I am downloading models there.&nbsp; So refresh and it will return back to original

- [00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=703) since I didn't remember settings. Then I need&nbsp; to click download all models of the LTX 2 core

- [00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=711) bundle. Then it will start downloading with 16&nbsp; connections. You can also drag and drop this

- [00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=716) like this to expand or make it small or click&nbsp; here. And it will start the downloads. It will

- [00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=721) do hash verification. It will download all the&nbsp; models that I have prepared for you. You can

- [00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=726) also see their names here. If you have a very low&nbsp; VRAM GPU alternatively go to the video generation

- [00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=732) models. Go to the LTX 2 video models and you&nbsp; can download the LTX 2 distilled GGUF model.

- [00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=742) Which is here. So you can download GGUF Q4 model&nbsp; if you are on very low RAM and VRAM. This is not

- [00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=750) recommended. Normally I use FP8 scaled. This is&nbsp; also what the bundle downloads. And additionally

- [00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=755) you can also download FP4 mixed text encoder but&nbsp; by default I am using this one. This is mixed FP8

- [00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=763) scaled. The name is like this because SwarmUI&nbsp; uses this automatically and my presets are also

- [00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=769) set for this so don't worry the presets will&nbsp; be one click. So follow the download process

- [00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=774) here. It will download all the original models&nbsp; as you are seeing very fast. 100 megabytes per

- [00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=781) second on my computer. Then it will verify them&nbsp; then you will be ready to start using them.

- [00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=786) Moreover since I am using extra model paths.yaml&nbsp; file inside ComfyUI when I start my ComfyUI you

- [00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=792) see it adds all the models that I have given it.&nbsp; So it sees all the models that I have in SwarmUI

- [00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=800) in ComfyUI. Therefore I am avoiding all the model&nbsp; duplication. And I am using central model folder.

- [00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=808) You can also modify this file according to&nbsp; your needs. Add more paths or more mapping.

- [00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=814) It works. SwarmUI also has this feature. You&nbsp; can give another base model path and it see

- [00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=820) all of them. So you can have all of your models&nbsp; inside ComfyUI and also use in SwarmUI as well.

- [00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=826) Since model downloader downloads with 16&nbsp; connections it will merge all the downloaded

- [00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=832) pieces into single file at the end. So you will&nbsp; see like this it is merging then it will verify

- [00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=839) the hash. So now it is verifying its hash value.&nbsp; This is also working on cloud and Linux machines.

- [00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=845) This way we are ensuring that we have accurately&nbsp; downloaded the models. Therefore we will never

- [00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=850) have any corrupted model at all. Moreover this&nbsp; downloader application supports custom model

- [00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=856) downloads as well. So let's hide this. Go to the&nbsp; URL downloader. In here you just need to give the

- [00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=863) model path. It can be CivitAI. It can be Hugging&nbsp; Face. And you can select the folder where it will

- [00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=869) download so that you can download your custom&nbsp; models this way on cloud machines or on your

- [00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=875) Windows computer very fast. You can also provide&nbsp; your API keys to download even faster. This is

- [00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=882) very very useful especially on RunPod on Massed&nbsp; Compute to download fast into the accurate folder.

- [00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=888) Okay so all the models have been downloaded.&nbsp; Let's return back to our ComfyUI. Let's refresh.

- [00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=894) Then inside ComfyUI extracted zip file you will&nbsp; see there are presets. So the newest presets are

- [00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=902) LTX 2 image to video, text to video, audio lip&nbsp; sync and Z-Image base and Z-Image base with 2x

- [00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=909) upscale. For Z-Image base don't forget you need to&nbsp; download same way Z-Image core bundle. Okay first

- [00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=916) I will show you LTX 2 audio to lip sync image&nbsp; to video. Drag and drop it. So it is loaded. You

- [00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=924) shouldn't have any red or warnings here if you&nbsp; have followed the steps that I have just shown

- [00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=929) you. This is extremely high quality and fully&nbsp; optimized to work on low VRAM GPUs and systems

- [00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=936) as well. So first of all you need to pick your&nbsp; image. Let's choose file to upload. I am going

- [00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=943) to use this anime image. Then you need to set&nbsp; your width and height accurately. This is 9

- [00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=951) to 16 therefore I am going to use 720 to 1280.&nbsp; If you are not sure how to set your width and

- [00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=960) height accurately I recommend you to use SwarmUI.&nbsp; Unfortunately this preset doesn't exist in SwarmUI

- [00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=968) because it doesn't support it. It uses a lot&nbsp; of custom nodes. Then quick tools reset params

- [00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=974) to default. I am going to use my LTX 2 image to&nbsp; video. Then you can see that it will show you the

- [00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=981) resolution like this and init image. So choose&nbsp; the same file in here. Resolution use closest

- [00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=987) aspect ratio. You see this image is 720 to 1280&nbsp; pixel for this model. Okay it is set. Then you

- [00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=995) need to set your audio file which will be driving&nbsp; audio. I am going to use this 45 seconds audio.

- [00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=1004) SECourses. Let's go.

- [00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=1008) Okay this way you can verify your audio is&nbsp; working. So you see there is audio length in

- [00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=1013) seconds. So first set your audio length.&nbsp; You can also set audio start index here.

- [00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=1018) Then when you click this run and stop&nbsp; immediately you will see that it is

- [00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=1024) showing you how many frames you need here. So&nbsp; I need 1081 frames for this video. After that

- [00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=1031) you need to write your prompt. When you are&nbsp; using audio this is how you should prompt it.

- [00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=1039) Describe your audio in details plus write the full&nbsp; spoken or singing like this. You see this is the

- [00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=1050) lyrics of my audio. If it was a speaking it would&nbsp; be the subtitles transcription of the speaking.

- [00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=1058) So this is the way of it. Then I have after few&nbsp; tries I have come up with this prompt. You can

- [00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=1064) pause the video and read it. And like this. So&nbsp; this is my prompt like this and run. Then all

- [00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=1073) you need to do is just wait. You don't need to&nbsp; change anything else. You can also change your

- [00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=1079) final video quality from here. You see CRF this&nbsp; is the video quality. If you make this very low

- [00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=1085) it will be very big generated MP4 file. Let's also&nbsp; monitor our VRAM usage and the speed. Currently we

- [00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=1094) are running it on no VRAM. Therefore it will use&nbsp; minimal absolutely minimal amount of VRAM. So we

- [00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=1102) can see both of the screens like this. It will&nbsp; be therefore slow but it will work on every GPU.

- [00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=1110) Okay once the generation starts. So even if you&nbsp; have a 6 gigabyte GPU 4 gigabyte GPU you can use

- [00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=1117) all these presets with the way I have shown you&nbsp; in the beginning of the video how to start your

- [00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=1124) ComfyUI. This applies to SwarmUI as well. In&nbsp; the SwarmUI you set the same arguments into

- [00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=1131) your ComfyUI backend. And it is also using&nbsp; my GPU very decent. I mean look at that. It

- [00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=1137) is using like 500 watts. This is really really&nbsp; good. It is using my GPU very well. And it is

- [00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=1142) only using 5000 megabytes VRAM right now. So this&nbsp; way you can generate very long videos on very low

- [00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=1150) VRAM GPUs. And you can use the same arguments&nbsp; in your backend in your SwarmUI. It will work

- [00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=1156) exactly same. Remember when we started the&nbsp; ComfyUI it has shown what parameters what

- [00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=1164) arguments have been used like no VRAM cache none&nbsp; disable smart memory. Use Sage Attention disable

- [00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=1171) asynchronous offload. This way I have minimized&nbsp; my VRAM usage. So it is only using 5 gigabytes

- [00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=1179) of VRAM for 1081 frames at HD resolution. And it&nbsp; is generating it right now. This workflow first

- [00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=1189) do 8 steps for initial video generation then it&nbsp; does 3 steps of the upscale. The upscale will

- [00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=1196) be of course slower. And during the upscale&nbsp; it uses more VRAM as expected since it is

- [00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=1203) now bigger resolution. So you can reduce your&nbsp; length if you get out of VRAM error or on your

- [00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=1209) computer it may do even further optimization&nbsp; since I have VRAM maybe it didn't do I am not

- [00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=1215) sure. And the time is still very decent. I mean&nbsp; very acceptable time even at these settings.

- [00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=1224) Let's see it.

- [00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=1227) SECourses. Let's go. Late night screen glow. Ideas&nbsp; on fire. Turning what if into something higher.

- [00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=1234) From zero to flow. We learn it fast. Build it&nbsp; ship it make the future last. New tools new

- [00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=1239) rules we break the doubt. Take that prompt watch&nbsp; the AI route. If you want the shortcuts done the

- [00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=1243) right way. Hit play let's level up today. Hands&nbsp; on the keyboard mind on the dream. Watch the

- [00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=1249) model run like a laser beam. No fear no fluff just&nbsp; clarity. One more step to your next victory. SECourses

- [00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=1254) AI on the rise. Lighting up the dark&nbsp; with electric skies. From prompts to pixels

- [00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=1259) code to sound. We make it real we run this ground.&nbsp; That's courses learn build repeat. Turn big ideas

- [00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=1266) into something elite. If you want the best place&nbsp; to start. That's courses straight to the heart.

- [00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=1271) Purely amazing. This time there weren't any&nbsp; noise. There weren't any text. There weren't

- [00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=1276) any issues. This was even better than my initial&nbsp; demo that I have shown you. So what about using

- [00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=1282) the presets? They will be surely faster and they&nbsp; will be using lesser VRAM since we will be doing

- [00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=1289) lesser amount of frames. So let's begin with&nbsp; the image to video. Drag and drop it. You can

- [00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=1295) also open. So this is much more straightforward.&nbsp; Choose and upload your image. Same way like this.

- [00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=1303) Set your video height and width. I am going to&nbsp; use the same like this. Type your prompt. And

- [00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=1310) how you can make your prompt better? Now let&nbsp; me show you. In the SwarmUI zip file you will

- [00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=1316) see that there is LTX 2 enhance prompt feed for&nbsp; LLMs. When you open it you will see its content

- [00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=1324) like this. So to use this I am going to use Google&nbsp; AI Studio. Then drag and drop the file like this.

- [00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=1331) Enter your prompt and if you are also using an&nbsp; image add your image as well. This will help

- [00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=1338) it to also modify prompt according to the image.&nbsp; And run. If you are not using image just text to

- [00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=1345) video just type like this and it will enhance it&nbsp; automatically for you. The logic is same. Okay it

- [00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=1352) did enhance it. By the way using Google AI Studio&nbsp; is free. Therefore just copy paste it and run.

- [00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=1359) You can also change the duration from frame&nbsp; count. This is 24 FPS model therefore when

- [00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=1365) you divide this 24 it makes 5 second. So 5&nbsp; multiplied with 24 plus 1 equal to our frame

- [00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=1374) count. If I want it 10 seconds then I need to make&nbsp; this 241 frames. So let's see the VRAM usage. It

- [00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=1383) will use very minimal amount of VRAM since we&nbsp; are only generating 121 frames. Okay let's see

- [00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=1391) how much VRAM it will use. It is also using&nbsp; very minimal amount of RAM memory too. During

- [00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=1396) the upscale it will use more GPU obviously.&nbsp; And the speed is also amazing even though I

- [00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=1402) am running it with no VRAM command argument.&nbsp; Okay with the upscale it is using 2.7. It is

- [00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=1412) using 3 gigabytes of VRAM during the upscale.&nbsp; This is amazing. I mean you will be able to

- [00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=1417) generate 5 second HD videos with only 3 gigabytes&nbsp; of VRAM memory. Can you believe that? Okay at the

- [00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=1425) end it used some more for the VAE tiling but it&nbsp; is fine. And we have the video. So let's see.

- [00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=1433) Hello everyone welcome.

- [00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=1435) It did some animation maybe changing the seed&nbsp; will help or I need to change the prompt but it

- [00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=1442) is working great so play with it to see. Then&nbsp; I will restart my ComfyUI with proper starting

- [00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=1451) and I will show Z-Image but for Z-Image I need&nbsp; to remove the Sage Attention because currently

- [00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=1458) Z-Image base is not working. The text to video&nbsp; is also same I am not going to show it. So let's

- [00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=1464) run the application with full optimizations with&nbsp; full speed and without Sage Attention. Okay the

- [00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=1472) application started. For Z-Image we are going to&nbsp; use the Z-Image with 2x upscale. I recommend this.

- [00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=1479) This is working really amazing. Amazing quality.&nbsp; Then type your prompt as you wish you know this

- [00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=1486) is just regular prompting. Let's use this prompt&nbsp; to see what we are going to get. Okay run. I am

- [00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=1492) also working on Z-Image NVFP4 model a properly&nbsp; made NVFP4 model so it will be 2x faster with

- [00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=1501) almost same quality. Our SECourses Musubi Trainer&nbsp; application is going to have all these convert to

- [00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=1509) quant options FP8 int8 and FP4 so that you&nbsp; will be also able to convert any model you

- [00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=1516) want into FP8 scaled quantized FP8 it will be&nbsp; amazing quality like original BF16 or NVFP4. It

- [00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=1524) will be 100 percentage faster on Blackwell GPUs.&nbsp; All of them. 5060 5070 5080 whatever 50 or newer

- [00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=1534) versions you get in future. So this is going to&nbsp; generate 4 megapixel resolution image. This has

- [00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=1541) the best upscale. If you don't want to upscale&nbsp; you just need to use the Z-Image base preset.

- [00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=1548) Okay let's see our generated image. By default&nbsp; I am doing 40 steps but you can reduce the step

- [00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=1555) count to 20 as well. With LTX 2 the step&nbsp; count is not changing. It is 8 and in the

- [00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=1562) upscale it is 3. But with the Z-Image base&nbsp; or with majority of the other models you can

- [00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=1568) change the steps count according to your need&nbsp; the speed. Currently it is using 18 gigabytes

- [00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=1574) of VRAM but with optimizations you can run this&nbsp; as low as 6 gigabyte GPUs. Since we are doing 4

- [00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=1581) megapixel image it is taking some time but we&nbsp; will get an amazing quality image. By the way

- [00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=1586) I don't know how will this video prompt work but&nbsp; you know the drill you can change the prompt as

- [00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=1592) you wish. Okay it generated image let's open in&nbsp; the new tab. So open image like this. Yeah for

- [00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=1601) this prompt this is a very decent output. All&nbsp; the generated files will be saved inside your

- [00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=1607) ComfyUI into your output folder. You see they&nbsp; are all saved. Even the videos are saved. To

- [00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=1614) remember the videos you need to do this. You see&nbsp; there is PNG file drag and drop it and it will

- [00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=1619) load everything from that PNG with the sets. So&nbsp; with the videos it saves a PNG file to save the

- [00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=1626) metadata. And the images are also saved like this&nbsp; with the ComfyUI extension. If you want to save

- [00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=1632) images with another prefix you can change the&nbsp; file name prefix from here. Or with the Z-Image

- [00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=1638) you can change the save prefix from here. You see&nbsp; ComfyUI you can change it to anything you want.

- [00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=1644) So this is all for ComfyUI for today. All other&nbsp; presets are working exactly same logic. You can

- [00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=1650) use all of our amazing presets that is coming&nbsp; with our zip file. You see all of them is working

- [00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=1657) tested working perfect. You just need to download&nbsp; the bundles. Like Z-Image, Flux 2, Wan, Qwen. We

- [00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=1665) have bundles for every major model out there. And&nbsp; for SwarmUI I am going to use the same ComfyUI

- [00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=1672) installation the backend. So let's just close our&nbsp; ComfyUI. So as usual download the latest SwarmUI

- [00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=1677) model downloader zip file. Overwrite your previous&nbsp; files. Then you should update your SwarmUI Windows

- [00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=1684) update SwarmUI. This will install necessary newer&nbsp; stuff and also update your SwarmUI to the latest

- [00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=1692) version. I have developed an extension for SwarmUI&nbsp; to support LTX 2 image to video upscale. Normally

- [00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=1700) SwarmUI is not supporting it but we are now&nbsp; supporting it. You can see that my extension is

- [00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=1707) compiled like this when you start it. Then go to&nbsp; the server backends and enter your backend as in

- [00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=1714) the same as other videos. You see ComfyUI backend.&nbsp; How you give the ComfyUI backend it is so easy. Go

- [00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=1721) to your ComfyUI installation ComfyUI folder copy&nbsp; it. Edit the here. Actually let me add a new one

- [00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=1730) to show you. So let's refresh. And ComfyUI self&nbsp; starting and edit it. Copy paste main.py. Extra

- [00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=1739) arguments. This is where you define your ComfyUI&nbsp; starting arguments like --use-sage-attention like

- [00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=1746) --cache-none like --no-vram. This way you can&nbsp; customize and optimize your ComfyUI backend.

- [00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=1754) Normally I just use Sage Attention. The only&nbsp; case that I don't use at the moment is Z-Image

- [00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=1760) base model because it degrades the quality&nbsp; significantly. It is broken at the moment. So

- [00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=1765) wait for your backend to start and it is started.&nbsp; Quick tools reset params to default. You need to

- [00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=1771) get the latest presets. So either import from&nbsp; here or my recommended way is Windows preset

- [00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=1778) delete import. So run it and hit yes and it will&nbsp; delete all of your previous presets and refresh

- [00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=1784) them with the new one. So refresh sort by name.&nbsp; All the newer presets are arrived like Z-Image

- [00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=1790) base or LTX 2 text to video LTX 2 upscale. When&nbsp; you use upscale you need to reduce your resolution

- [00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=1797) to half. So let's make a demo of image to video.&nbsp; Quick tools reset params to default. Click here

- [00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=1802) and direct apply. Since I have downloaded&nbsp; the LTX 2 video core bundle all the models

- [00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=1809) are automatically downloaded and selected. I&nbsp; have spent huge time to prepare these presets.

- [00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=1814) Then to use the image to video you need to choose&nbsp; your init image like this one. Then you need to

- [00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=1821) go to the image to video tab and set your video&nbsp; frame count. It is 121 frames right now. So it

- [00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=1828) will be 5 second video. Then enter your prompt&nbsp; same as in ComfyUI and you can generate as many

- [00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=1836) as videos you want. Let's generate one. So this&nbsp; will generate an image to video. You can always

- [00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=1841) follow the status from server logs debug menu to&nbsp; see what is happening. Let's also write another

- [00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=1848) prompt with an enhancement. So I am just going to&nbsp; use the Google AI Studio Gemini 3 Pro preview and

- [00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=1856) from SwarmUI we have LTX 2 enhance type my prompt.&nbsp; So this is my prompt. Let's see the enhancement.

- [00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=1865) Okay you see it had an error. Sometimes you may&nbsp; get this because of how the ComfyUI working just

- [00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=1871) hit generate again. This is happening because&nbsp; when you first time run it for some reason it

- [00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=1877) fails to properly load model. To prevent it you&nbsp; need to add --use-cache-none. So when you first

- [00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=1885) time click generate if you get error just wait&nbsp; and click generate again. This happens with the

- [00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=1892) LTX 2 video they didn't fix it yet. I am expecting&nbsp; fix hopefully soon. Don't worry just hit generate

- [00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=1899) again. You can also add the optimizations like&nbsp; disable smart memory or like cache none or low

- [00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=1909) VRAM. So one of them will work for your case.&nbsp; Once the first generation is completed it will

- [00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=1916) keep working. Okay now it is generating image to&nbsp; video. It should be also pretty fast. Yes. Okay

- [00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=1922) you see the image is changed like this&nbsp; because of my prompt so I need to modify

- [00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=1929) my prompt. For example like this. A video of a&nbsp; talking man saying hello everyone. So if your

- [00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=1937) image changes dramatically like this because&nbsp; of your prompt. You need to make it in a way

- [00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=1944) that it will not change the initial image.&nbsp; Let's see the new prompt impact. You see the

- [00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=1950) first video was done in 55 seconds. Second&nbsp; one is done in 35 seconds. Let's see it.

- [00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=1957) Hello everyone welcome.

- [00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=1959) Yes perfect quality. Perfectly matching the&nbsp; initial image. There is no changes so it is

- [00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=1964) all about your prompt. Prompt enhance may break&nbsp; image to video however it works really good at

- [00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=1971) text to video. Now let's see the text to video.&nbsp; So quick tools reset params to default and we

- [00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=1977) have LTX 2 text to video direct apply. Let's see&nbsp; our prompt like this. So this is enhanced prompt.

- [00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=1985) Change the resolution or aspect ratio. You can&nbsp; also change the duration from text to video. The

- [00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=1992) image to video is here image to video you change&nbsp; the frame count there. For text to video it is

- [00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=1998) here. So let's make this 241 frames and that's&nbsp; it generate. You can also upscale with text to

- [00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=2007) video how for text to video upscale you need to&nbsp; custom and half resolution like 640 to 360 and

- [00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=2016) go to presets and just apply in additionally this&nbsp; LTX 2 upscale like direct apply and let's generate

- [00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=2024) another one. The first one will be original HD&nbsp; the second one will use the upscaler model of

- [00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=2032) the LTX 2. All the generations of the SwarmUI&nbsp; will be saved inside SwarmUI output local raw

- [00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=2042) and they are categorized by the days that you&nbsp; generated them. You see all my images videos

- [00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=2048) are all saved here with their metadata as well.&nbsp; Okay the first video generated let's watch it.

- [00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=2055) Faithfulls! Witness me!

- [00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=2064) Yeah for this prompt this is what it has&nbsp; generated. Now we have the upscaled version

- [00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=2069) let's watch it as well. So this way you&nbsp; can tune your prompt try different prompts

- [00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=2084) and see what you are getting you can also&nbsp; compare. This was a 10 second video and it

- [00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=2089) was only generated in 40 seconds. 40 seconds&nbsp; for 10 second video. Amazing. I mean this is

- [00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=2096) 241 frames. This would take forever on Wan 2.2&nbsp; model. It is only taking 40 seconds on LTX 2.

- [00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=2105) So what about Z-Image? For Z-Image I am going to&nbsp; go to backends and edit my backend and remove the

- [00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=2112) Sage Attention. Currently this is mandatory.&nbsp; Probably it will be fixed soon. Then let's

- [00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=2118) open another tab reset params to default and&nbsp; in the preset our base preset is this one. So

- [00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=2125) let's use the same prompt as in this case I don't&nbsp; know what it will generate. Then I am also going

- [00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=2133) to apply the upscale. Then with the same seed&nbsp; let's also use the upscale. So for upscale we

- [00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=2140) are going to use image upscale direct apply&nbsp; and generate another one. The first one will

- [00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=2145) be 1024 to 1024 the second image will be 2048 to&nbsp; 2048 with our image upscale preset. This image

- [00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=2154) upscale preset works on every image generation.&nbsp; Okay the first image is done it is here it is

- [00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=2161) like this. Let's see its upscaled version too.&nbsp; So this is what it has generated as a base. I

- [00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=2168) am doing 40 steps for highest quality but you&nbsp; can reduce this to 20 steps as well. There will

- [00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=2175) be minimal impact on quality and it will be twice&nbsp; faster. As I also said I am also working on NVFP4

- [00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=2184) version of the Z-Image base model therefore&nbsp; it will be 100 percentage faster and almost

- [00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=2190) same quality. Moreover we have FP8 scaled of&nbsp; the Z-Image base model so you can download

- [00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=2197) it with our downloader and also use it if you&nbsp; are low on VRAM like 6 gigabyte GPUs. However

- [00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=2204) this model is not very big. The FP8 scaled&nbsp; is only 5.6 gigabyte the BF16 is like only

- [00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=2211) 12 gigabytes. Okay the upscaled image is here.&nbsp; So this is the base image this is the upscaled

- [00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=2218) image. Let's compare them with our comparison&nbsp; application video comparison slider. The link

- [00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=2224) will be also description of the video to install&nbsp; this. Start image comparison. Let's put both the

- [00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=2231) files and full screen. So on the left we see&nbsp; the original normal image and on the right

- [00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=2237) we see the upscaled version. I mean look at&nbsp; the quality difference. The upscaled version

- [00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=2242) is much better. Many times better. It has added&nbsp; amazing amount of details quality so I recommend

- [00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=2250) you to use upscaled preset of the Z-Image&nbsp; base model to get really good images. The

- [00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=2258) realism of the Z-Image is already amazing&nbsp; so you can type a realistic prompt to get

- [00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=2264) realistic image like in this case. So it is all&nbsp; about your prompting to get whatever you want.

- [00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=2271) Now I will show you how to use ComfyUI and SwarmUI&nbsp; on RunPod. It is exactly actually same as before.

- [00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=2278) So once you downloaded the zip file you will&nbsp; see that we have RunPod SimplePod ComfyUI

- [00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=2283) instructions. RunPod and SimplePod are working&nbsp; exactly same way. You just need to follow this

- [00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=2289) file. You see we have RunPod section. So please&nbsp; use this link to register I appreciate that. Once

- [00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=2296) you registered login if it doesn't auto login&nbsp; you. Then go to billing add some credits. Then

- [00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=2305) return back to our instructions file always&nbsp; use the template mentioned here. So currently

- [00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=2312) we need to use this template for CUDA 13.&nbsp; This is based on official template don't

- [00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=2317) worry it just have some tweaks for you. Now&nbsp; this is super important. If you are going to

- [00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=2324) use your permanent storage select your permanent&nbsp; storage from here. So everything you do will be

- [00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=2329) saved 100 percentage. If you are not going to use&nbsp; permanent storage so just don't select anything

- [00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=2335) here. What you need to select here is additional&nbsp; filters and CUDA version 12.9. Unfortunately they

- [00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=2344) still didn't add CUDA 13 here. They need to add&nbsp; and upgrade their Nvidia drivers but they still

- [00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=2351) didn't do. Therefore we are selecting 12.9. This&nbsp; should bring us machines that has Nvidia drivers

- [00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=2359) that can run CUDA 13. Then select NVME and 100&nbsp; gigabytes. So when we apply these two presets

- [00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=2367) unfortunately there aren't many machines we can&nbsp; use yet with CUDA 13 ComfyUI. So these are the

- [00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=2374) machines available. I am going to use RTX Pro&nbsp; 6000. This is one of the best as you know. Then

- [00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=2379) you see it has selected our template. I am going&nbsp; to contact to RunPod team to upgrade their drivers

- [00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=2385) so that CUDA 13 will arrive and they will upgrade&nbsp; their Nvidia drivers so we will be able to use

- [00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=2392) more machines. And in the template you can edit&nbsp; and change your volume disk if you are using your

- [00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=2400) permanent network storage. It will use whatever&nbsp; the space you have there but this will make a new

- [00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=2407) storage. So making permanent storage is so easy&nbsp; go to storage tab here click new network volume

- [00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=2413) select the server according to your server&nbsp; you will be limited to that region only so

- [00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=2419) this will limit your GPU availability. You can&nbsp; also click from here to see which regions have

- [00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=2425) more GPUs of this for example this one. Type&nbsp; your storage name 600 gigabytes type like 600

- [00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=2432) gigabyte and create network volume. Then you&nbsp; will be able to use it but I am not going to

- [00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=2437) use right now so I am going to delete it to&nbsp; not waste any money. Okay let's delete it.

- [00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=2443) So then deploy on demand. Now you need to wait&nbsp; a little to start the machine. It will take a

- [00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=2451) while like 5 minutes depending on the region on&nbsp; the server maybe 2 minutes. Unfortunately RunPod

- [00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=2458) machines are slow. Therefore Massed Compute&nbsp; is much faster. Now we are also supporting

- [00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=2464) SimplePod so easy to use same way actually. It&nbsp; is also faster and more GPUs available there.

- [00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=2470) I started 3 identical machines to see which&nbsp; one is starting fastest. Once I verify the

- [00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=2477) starting fastest one I will delete the other&nbsp; ones. Unfortunately with RunPod this is like

- [00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=2483) this you don't have many options you can also&nbsp; pick another GPU to make it start faster for

- [00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=2491) example like H200. This is a beast machine.&nbsp; It will work even faster than RTX Pro 6000.

- [00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=2498) So if you don't want to wait too long you can&nbsp; pick your machine accordingly or you can use

- [00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=2503) permanent storage to avoid this. So all of them is&nbsp; failing to start right now. Okay this one started.

- [00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=2511) Yeah this is probably H200 let's see yes. You&nbsp; see the H200 has a much better connection and

- [00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=2518) disk speed but I just emailed the RunPod team&nbsp; I think they will upgrade their Nvidia drivers

- [00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=2525) therefore we will have more machines available.&nbsp; Of course always you can use SimplePod and Massed

- [00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=2533) Compute. They need to upgrade their Nvidia driver&nbsp; so that we can use any machine available. Yeah I

- [00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=2539) will continue with H200 for this tutorial&nbsp; because it is already starting so I will

- [00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=2544) disable other machines stop not waste any time&nbsp; any money start. This is a shame the size of

- [00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=2552) the template is 9 gigabytes therefore it should&nbsp; be instant but you see the RunPod is very very

- [00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=2558) slow nowadays. They are degrading in quality&nbsp; unfortunately. I hope they become better. So

- [00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=2564) we are giving them feedback you should also give&nbsp; them feedback email them contact their support

- [00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=2570) tell them to upgrade their Nvidia driver add&nbsp; more GPUs. Okay this should start fairly fast.

- [00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=2576) You can see the download process. It doesn't&nbsp; matter which GPU you select my installers and

- [00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=2582) template supports all of them. What matters is&nbsp; the Nvidia driver which we are going to see in

- [00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=2588) telemetry when it starts it will show the&nbsp; Nvidia driver here. It should be 575 plus.

- [00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=2595) I just emailed them to upgrade all into 580 plus&nbsp; so that we can use any machine hopefully they do.

- [00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=2603) Okay the machine started when I go to connect you&nbsp; see it shows connect from 3001 this is ComfyUI

- [00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=2610) port we didn't start it yet and JupyterLab. So&nbsp; click the JupyterLab interface. You see the driver

- [00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=2616) is when we go to telemetry we see the driver is&nbsp; 575. You can also try CUDA 12.8 but it may not

- [00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=2624) work. This is guaranteed to work with all cases&nbsp; 575 driver. Hopefully they will upgrade and we

- [00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=2632) will have it. Okay so the JupyterLab interface&nbsp; started I will just drag and drop my ComfyUI

- [00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=2638) zip file into workspace wait for upload to be&nbsp; completed. So you see it is uploading right now.

- [00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=2644) Then I will extract archive refresh. Yes all done.&nbsp; Now open the RunPod SimplePod ComfyUI instructions

- [00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=2653) copy this command open a new terminal paste and&nbsp; hit enter. Then it will ask you which options to

- [00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=2660) install same as Windows 1 and 100 we are going&nbsp; to install these two bundles and hit enter then

- [00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=2666) hit enter. Then it will install the ComfyUI fully&nbsp; properly for us. Now you need to download models.

- [00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=2673) For downloading models we are going to use SwarmUI&nbsp; model downloader so it is here just drag and drop

- [00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=2678) it here refresh. It is still uploading wait&nbsp; for upload to be completed. This installation

- [00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=2685) is extremely optimized and fast but it depends&nbsp; on your machine as always. By the way you should

- [00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=2692) also verify your GPU open a new terminal pip&nbsp; install nvitop then type nvitop. And verify

- [00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=2701) that GPU is there and it is empty. Sometimes&nbsp; GPUs are being stuck or frozen or something.

- [00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=2708) Okay the SwarmUI installer also downloaded.&nbsp; So I will also install SwarmUI exactly same as

- [00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=2716) in Windows tutorial part. Okay so for SwarmUI&nbsp; installation we have RunPod SimplePod SwarmUI

- [00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=2724) install instructions. Just copy this entire&nbsp; command open a new terminal and paste it.

- [00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=2732) This will install SwarmUI very fast. Once you see&nbsp; the SwarmUI folder here you can start downloading

- [00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=2738) models or you can not install SwarmUI and&nbsp; just download models into ComfyUI as well.

- [00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=2744) This machine is a little bit slow at installation&nbsp; unfortunately. Okay SwarmUI folder appeared so we

- [00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=2750) can begin downloading models. RunPod SimplePod&nbsp; model download instructions copy this open a new

- [00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=2757) terminal paste it. Meanwhile both SwarmUI and&nbsp; ComfyUI are getting installed. You can follow

- [00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=2764) each of them. Unfortunately this machine is&nbsp; very slow. So for SwarmUI installation you

- [00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=2769) see it has generated Cloudflared link agree&nbsp; customize okay next just yourself none this

- [00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=2777) is important because we are always going to&nbsp; use our custom ComfyUI installation next I

- [00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=2782) am not going to download anything next yes I&nbsp; am sure to install and SwarmUI installed. So

- [00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=2788) our model downloader started let's open it from&nbsp; this Gradio link. It will automatically see my

- [00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=2794) SwarmUI installation and its accurate folder.&nbsp; So you see it sees the models folder here.

- [00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=2801) If you don't want to install SwarmUI and use&nbsp; it go to ComfyUI right click models copy path.

- [00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=2808) Then put a backslash and type like this. So&nbsp; it starts with backslash then enable ComfyUI

- [00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=2815) folder structure and download the models. So let's&nbsp; download LTX 2 for ComfyUI installation. I will

- [00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=2824) also use same folder for SwarmUI. Okay let's&nbsp; wait for ComfyUI installation to be completed

- [00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=2831) meanwhile the models are getting downloaded&nbsp; we can see them here it is downloading them.

- [00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=2837) Okay so our ComfyUI installation has been&nbsp; completed. Now let's start our ComfyUI. To do

- [00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=2844) that return back to your RunPod SimplePod ComfyUI&nbsp; instructions txt file and in the below you will

- [00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=2851) see the run command. This is important to use it.&nbsp; Open a new terminal and copy paste and hit enter.

- [00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=2859) You see we are starting with use Sage Attention.&nbsp; You can remove this add here other additional

- [00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=2865) arguments. This is how we start the ComfyUI&nbsp; instance. Initial starting may be a little bit

- [00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=2871) slow but you should see the appropriate messages&nbsp; in here. We can see that how much VRAM and RAM

- [00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=2878) memory our machine has. We have 143 gigabytes of&nbsp; VRAM and 1.8 terabytes of RAM memory yes this is

- [00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=2887) an massive RAM memory. So it is using CUDA&nbsp; 13 torch 2.9.1 as I said my installers are

- [00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=2895) properly made for every GPU out there so you&nbsp; can use my installer with every GPU on cloud

- [00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=2902) or on Windows. So the ComfyUI has been started.&nbsp; When you see this it means it has been started.

- [00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=2908) How to connect? Return back to your MyPod instance&nbsp; and you will see that there is port 3001. When you

- [00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=2915) open it now you will see your ComfyUI interface&nbsp; which is running on RunPod and the rest is exactly

- [00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=2924) same as using on your Windows computer. So my&nbsp; ComfyUI is started. All of the models also have

- [00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=2931) been downloaded. Now I am ready to use presets. So&nbsp; let's drag and drop our LTX 2 audio lip sync image

- [00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=2937) to video preset. It is loaded. You see there&nbsp; is no red no error messages it is perfect. So

- [00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=2946) choose file to upload. I will do the same as on&nbsp; the Windows part. So let's see how much it will

- [00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=2953) take. This is 45 seconds. Let's also copy paste&nbsp; our prompt. I also need to set my duration the

- [00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=2961) rest is exactly same as on the Windows tutorial&nbsp; part. You can also calculate 45 seconds equal to

- [00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=2969) 45 multiplied 24 plus 1 1081 frames. And we can&nbsp; hit run here. Now you can follow the CMD window

- [00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=2981) on here. Let's also see the nvitop. pip install&nbsp; nvitop. nvitop. So we can follow the VRAM usage

- [00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=2991) from here. The initial loading of the model may&nbsp; be slow but we will see. You will also get these

- [00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=2998) messages you can ignore them it is still working&nbsp; perfect. This is ComfyUI mistake actually on some

- [00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=3005) models it shows these as unexpected or some other&nbsp; messages but it is working perfect right now. This

- [00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=3011) is also ComfyUI mistake which they have to fix but&nbsp; it is not fixed yet. By the way on this machine we

- [00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=3018) can also use BF16 model. Our unified downloader&nbsp; is downloading the FP8. How you can download it

- [00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=3024) on this machine? In the video generation models&nbsp; you can go to LTX 2 video models and you can

- [00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=3030) download the BF16 version directly. Because&nbsp; this machine has a huge amount of VRAM memory.

- [00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=3037) So the initial loading of the model is taking&nbsp; forever on RunPod disks because they are slow.

- [00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=3043) Okay model loaded and generation started. You&nbsp; see it is almost instant even for 45 seconds.

- [00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=3052) The first 8 steps took only 13 seconds. And now&nbsp; it is upscaling. It is using 48 gigabytes of

- [00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=3059) VRAM memory. So if you have RTX Pro 6000 on your&nbsp; Windows machine you can run this model very fast.

- [00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=3066) I mean shame on Nvidia. They are still selling us&nbsp; RTX 5090 from only 32 gigabytes of VRAM memory.

- [00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=3075) Okay this was also done very fast so it is like&nbsp; 30 seconds to generate 45 seconds video. We are

- [00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=3082) almost done. It is doing the now VAE decoding.&nbsp; It is using 57 gigabytes of VRAM memory right

- [00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=3089) now. Yeah it is already okay it is now combining&nbsp; video after that it will be completed. So it takes

- [00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=3096) like 1 minute to generate 45 seconds video on&nbsp; H200 and it is already done yes. Let me show.

- [00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=3118) Okay it is same as in the Windows tutorial part&nbsp; it is working perfect no issues directly working.

- [00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=3125) So how you can also use the SwarmUI in here?&nbsp; Since everything is ready all I need to do is

- [00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=3132) I need to turn off the ComfyUI. So that SwarmUI&nbsp; can use the entire GPU. To turn off the ComfyUI

- [00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=3141) normally you wouldn't need this if you don't&nbsp; run the ComfyUI. When you return back to the

- [00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=3146) prompts you will see that it has this command.&nbsp; So copy and open a new terminal if you want to

- [00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=3153) terminate your ComfyUI. This will terminate&nbsp; the ComfyUI properly and you will see that

- [00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=3159) it is using zero amount of VRAM. Now my SwarmUI&nbsp; already had started. I am going to go to server

- [00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=3167) backends ComfyUI self starting. I need to copy&nbsp; the path of the ComfyUI main.py so right click

- [00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=3176) copy path. Go to your SwarmUI put a backslash like&nbsp; this and --use-sage-attention and save. Now the

- [00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=3187) SwarmUI will be ready. Normally we won't have any&nbsp; models here because we didn't download them into

- [00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=3194) here we downloaded them into ComfyUI folder. So&nbsp; I can go to server configuration and I can go to

- [00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=3201) models folder here copy path put a backslash like&nbsp; this save after that we may be needed to restart

- [00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=3210) but let's see. Okay let's refresh. Yes the model&nbsp; arrived but it doesn't see the other model because

- [00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=3218) I need to change this into checkpoints. This is&nbsp; where it is downloaded in the ComfyUI. Yes. Now

- [00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=3226) I am ready to use everything. The VAE is here&nbsp; let's see. Okay it doesn't show but let's see

- [00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=3234) the Loras. Okay Lora is also different it must&nbsp; be something like this. By the way you don't

- [00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=3240) need this if you just download them into your&nbsp; SwarmUI folder. So let's see the Loras arrived.

- [00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=3247) Okay server configuration checkpoints Loras VAE.&nbsp; Oh I know why it is not working because it is not

- [00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=3255) Loras but Lora in ComfyUI. Yes like this. And the&nbsp; VAE folder is we need to check inside models it

- [00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=3264) is yeah accurate VAE. So you can look for the&nbsp; folder names. The Lora is Lora here let's see.

- [00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=3272) Okay this is empty. The Lora empty. Loras empty.&nbsp; And it is Loras. So it is case sensitive on Linux

- [00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=3282) machine therefore it is this. Yes. Save. And&nbsp; yes now I can see the Loras. Now I can import

- [00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=3291) the presets. SwarmUI model downloader the preset&nbsp; 45 import and it is ready. So now I can generate

- [00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=3302) anything I want. Let's generate text to video.&nbsp; So it is let's sort by the name. You can also

- [00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=3309) search from here like LTX LTX 2 text to video&nbsp; direct apply. So models are selected. The Loras

- [00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=3318) are also selected. All I need to do is just type&nbsp; my prompt. A man talking to camera and speaking

- [00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=3327) this is amazing. This is a just simple prompt you&nbsp; know the drill from the Windows tutorial part. You

- [00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=3334) can follow the status from logs debug menu. Now&nbsp; the SwarmUI will work perfectly fine on RunPod.

- [00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=3343) So how you can download the generations? Go to&nbsp; your output folder. So in here I can download

- [00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=3350) entire output with right click and download&nbsp; as an archive. It will start to download like

- [00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=3356) this. So you see it is downloaded the entire&nbsp; output. Since our downloader also downloads

- [00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=3362) the clip models text encoder models VAE models&nbsp; you won't see any of them downloaded from here.

- [00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=3368) We do everything fully automatically for you&nbsp; with the fastest and most accurate way both

- [00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=3375) in Windows and also in Linux. My Massed Compute&nbsp; instructions Massed Compute install files are

- [00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=3382) all for Linux so if you are a Linux user you&nbsp; can use them right away. It is still loading

- [00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=3387) model for SwarmUI to generate. Okay so the&nbsp; generation has been completed let's see it.

- [00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=3393) This is amazing.

- [00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=3395) Yeah this was our simple prompt and we got it.&nbsp; So how to download SwarmUI generations? Go to

- [00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=3401) SwarmUI go to output local. You can download&nbsp; entire raw folder download as an archive and

- [00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=3408) it will start download and save it and you&nbsp; have that. So how to terminate your machine

- [00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=3413) from stop pod. This will reduce your cost&nbsp; per hour but it will not make it zero. To

- [00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=3420) make it zero just terminate pod and everything&nbsp; is deleted. If we were using storage we would

- [00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=3426) still have it in here. But we are not&nbsp; using permanent storage so all is gone.

- [00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=3431) And one more thing before we proceed the RunPod&nbsp; developer team had replied my emails and they

- [00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=3438) are working on improving the Nvidia driver&nbsp; of the pods. You can see their answer here.

- [00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=3447) So hopefully in future all of the machines will&nbsp; work with our ComfyUI CUDA 13 installation. So

- [00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=3455) if your machine doesn't work currently&nbsp; you can select the CUDA 12.9 probably

- [00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=3462) they will add 13 too or CUDA 12.8 but&nbsp; this will probably won't be necessary

- [00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=3470) once they upgrade the Nvidia driver&nbsp; of all the machines. This is for now.

- [00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=3475) And as a next step I will show how to use&nbsp; SimplePod. For SimplePod we are going to use

- [00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=3480) RunPod SimplePod ComfyUI instructions file. You&nbsp; see the SimplePod is here. What is the difference?

- [00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=3486) Let's register from this link I appreciate that.&nbsp; Then go to your dashboard add some billing like

- [00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=3493) this. Then we are going to use this SimplePod&nbsp; template. This is faster than the RunPod. You

- [00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=3500) see it is showing this use template like this.&nbsp; This template already has all the features that

- [00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=3509) we need. Now you need to rent a machine. So&nbsp; we have RTX 5090 very cheap on SimplePod you

- [00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=3518) see it is only 47 cents. This is double price&nbsp; on RunPod. RTX Pro 6000 is only 72 cents. This

- [00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=3527) is almost triple price on RunPod. So let's go&nbsp; with the RTX Pro 6000 Blackwell GPU. This GPU

- [00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=3534) has 96 gigabyte of VRAM memory and it is same&nbsp; fast as the RTX 5090 even faster than that. And

- [00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=3544) then run. So this is going to have 51 gigabytes of&nbsp; disk space therefore you can edit it and increase

- [00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=3552) your disk space according to your need like 200&nbsp; gigabytes. Then it will re-create the disk. When

- [00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=3561) you are first time creating the disk you can also&nbsp; select from there. So let's return back and click

- [00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=3567) here. The template is selected. You can edit&nbsp; and use. You see there is use template and edit

- [00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=3572) and use. Let's use the edit and use and there&nbsp; is also add persistent volume. SimplePod also

- [00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=3578) has persistent volume let me show you that. So&nbsp; go to storage add a new persistent volume like

- [00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=3584) 200 gigabytes and the name is 200. It is like 3&nbsp; times cheaper than the RunPod. Save. Let's return

- [00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=3591) back to our template selection double click.&nbsp; And I am going to select add persistent volume

- [00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=3597) and edit and use. Now it will let me select from&nbsp; here 200 make this workspace this is important.

- [01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=3606) And the system is ready. So this is going to&nbsp; use my persistent volume. Save and use. And

- [01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=3612) when I go to my servers you will see that it is&nbsp; going to start. Okay we made a mistake let's do

- [01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=3620) again. Add persistent volume edit and use. So&nbsp; 200 workspace. Okay save and use. Oh by the way

- [01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=3629) it changed the template it still didn't selected a&nbsp; machine so we are going to select this machine for

- [01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=3635) example and run. So this one is going to use my&nbsp; persistent volume. The other one is also started

- [01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=3642) here. They don't show the persistent volume&nbsp; but you will understand it actually there is

- [01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=3648) one hint of it. This shows 200 gigabytes and this&nbsp; shows disk volume and volume. When you have disk

- [01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=3654) volume and volume it means that you are using your&nbsp; persistent volume. So the rest is same how same?

- [01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=3661) You see that there is Jupiter interface direct&nbsp; link go to there. If it asks you to continue

- [01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=3668) continue because direct means that it is using&nbsp; direct connection. Then you see the RunPod like

- [01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=3674) interface started. Upload your ComfyUI SwarmUI&nbsp; whatever you want. By the way everything is much

- [01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=3681) faster on SimplePod that is the main difference&nbsp; and everything is much cheaper on SimplePod. So

- [01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=3687) you can use both SimplePod and RunPod then extract&nbsp; archive. And the rest is same let me just show you

- [01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=3695) the start of the terminal like this 1 and 100.&nbsp; Let's see the installation speed. Everything

- [01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=3703) is ready in this template. Okay the installation&nbsp; is just amazing amazingly fast as you are seeing

- [01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=3708) right now. Moreover you can download files much&nbsp; faster on SimplePod or upload. You see there is

- [01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=3715) file browser when you click this it will let&nbsp; you to download and upload files directly. Go

- [01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=3720) to workspace and every file will be here you&nbsp; can just select and download like this. Or you

- [01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=3727) can just upload from here. The upload allows you&nbsp; to upload file and folder. It is very very fast

- [01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=3734) compared to the RunPod. This way you can upload&nbsp; and download much faster than RunPod. So how to

- [01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=3742) terminate machines once you are done go back to&nbsp; your my servers there is delete options there

- [01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=3749) is no stop option here. So let's delete and let's&nbsp; delete. But all the data in your permanent storage

- [01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=3757) will remain there even if we deleted exactly as on&nbsp; RunPod. By the way on SimplePod we have forgotten

- [01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=3764) to show one more thing which was connecting the&nbsp; ComfyUI interface. For connecting the ComfyUI

- [01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=3771) interface we are going to use the 3000 port. My&nbsp; template already exposes that 3000 port so that

- [01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=3780) you will be able to connect from 3000 port on&nbsp; SimplePod to your ComfyUI instance. For SwarmUI

- [01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=3788) we are also using Cloudflared link as in the&nbsp; RunPod. So it is same as the RunPod actually.

- [01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=3794) So this is an alternative to RunPod much&nbsp; faster much cheaper but the disadvantage

- [01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=3799) is that it has limited amount of different&nbsp; GPUs. So when I go to rent GPU docker you

- [01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=3805) see 5090 and RTX Pro 6000 are the main GPUs&nbsp; that you can use. These two are the very best

- [01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=3811) GPUs actually that you can use for cheap&nbsp; but it is missing like A100 H200 B200 very

- [01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=3818) specific GPUs but it has the most commonly&nbsp; used amazing GPUs. So you were asking me to

- [01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=3823) make Vast AI scripts but instead of Vast AI I am&nbsp; providing you SimplePod. Cheaper better faster.

- [01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=3832) So as a next step let's do on the Massed Compute.&nbsp; To follow the Massed Compute open the Massed

- [01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=3838) Compute instructions read txt file. Please use&nbsp; this link to register I appreciate that. Once

- [01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=3845) you registered and logged in go to billing and&nbsp; add some credits as usual then go to deploy.

- [01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=3855) And in here it will show you the available GPUs.&nbsp; They have amazing prices so you can use H200 if

- [01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=3863) it is available and apply our coupon. Let's see&nbsp; if there is any availability. Oh actually there

- [01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=3869) is available yes nice. So you see currently it is&nbsp; 2.6 dollars per hour with our coupon SECourses it

- [01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=3876) becomes 1 dollar 95 cents. This is an amazing it&nbsp; is like 4 dollars on RunPod it is 2 dollars here.

- [01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=3885) So we can rent this or you can rent RTX Pro 6000&nbsp; if it is available. Oh they have sold out all

- [01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=3892) the RTX Pro 6000s. They are adding new GPUs but&nbsp; they are very popular. So let's go with this one.

- [01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=3900) This is even better at training than inference.&nbsp; So if you are going to do training since this GPU

- [01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=3906) has HBM memory high bandwidth unified memory it&nbsp; is faster than the other GPUs like RTX Pro 6000

- [01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=3915) or 5090. By the way when you are deploying don't&nbsp; forget that select category as a creator select

- [01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=3922) image as an SECourses. This is our image. This&nbsp; is mandatory to select then apply our coupon and

- [01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=3928) pick any GPU you want. You need to pick any&nbsp; GPU spots are not working but all other GPUs

- [01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=3934) are working like this. You see it is 41 cents.&nbsp; For example L40S it is 61 cents. Like H100 it

- [01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=3944) is okay this is spot instance yes H100 it is 1.76&nbsp; cents but I recommend H200 this is an amazing GPU.

- [01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=3954) So wait for GPU to be initialized it will take&nbsp; a little while. To connect we are going to use

- [01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=3960) ThinLinc client as usual so download the ThinLinc&nbsp; client from here for Windows Linux Mac. So just

- [01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=3967) download it. Then double click and start and&nbsp; next next install it will install and start.

- [01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=3974) From this ThinLinc client you need to go&nbsp; to options local devices just clipboard

- [01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=3979) synchronization and drives and add a shared&nbsp; folder with read and write permission I am

- [01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=3984) using this folder. Then move the downloaded&nbsp; ComfyUI and SwarmUI files into your shared

- [01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=3992) folder so that you will be able to access&nbsp; and use them. You can also put your other

- [01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=3997) files but you cannot use this for big files.&nbsp; For big files you have to use other storage

- [01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=4005) system like Hugging Face or Google Drive.&nbsp; Okay Massed Compute is getting initialized.

- [01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=4010) Machine initialization is now faster than&nbsp; before it should be done in 5 to 10 minutes.

- [01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=4016) Okay so the machine has been initialized let's&nbsp; connect it copy this login URL. Okay this was

- [01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=4022) done. Paste here copy password paste here copy&nbsp; username paste here connect. Continue. Okay it

- [01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=4031) is connecting then start. Okay it is starting&nbsp; and it is started. This is running on cloud on

- [01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=4039) Massed Compute. Go to home go to thin drives.&nbsp; You can also login your Patreon from here and

- [01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=4045) download links. Go to Massed Compute you see&nbsp; it is like your Windows computer there is

- [01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=4051) Chrome you can login download upload you can do&nbsp; whatever you want. Wait it to list the files in

- [01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=4058) your shared folder in here. So it will list all&nbsp; the files I have in here. This is synchronizing

- [01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=4065) with my computer but it is slow. So I am going to&nbsp; copy paste all the files version 78 and SwarmUI

- [01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=4074) latest version into downloads folder. Do not run&nbsp; anything in this shared folder. Always copy them

- [01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=4081) into downloads folder then we are going to run&nbsp; them from here. So wait for copy to be completed

- [01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=4088) it shows the progress here. The ComfyUI is done so&nbsp; extract here and Massed Compute instructions read

- [01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=4097) txt file. So to install we are going to use this&nbsp; command copy open a new terminal and paste it.

- [01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=4107) Then it will ask us to which ones to install 1 and&nbsp; 100 and hit enter. So the installation on Massed

- [01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=4116) Compute is like 10 times to 100 times faster than&nbsp; on RunPod the disk speed is like 100 times faster

- [01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=4122) than RunPod on Massed Compute. Their disadvantage&nbsp; is that they don't have permanent storage system

- [01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=4128) yet so every time you have to start from beginning&nbsp; but the speed is just mind blowingly fast so it

- [01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=4136) takes like 2 minutes to setup and start the Massed&nbsp; Compute. So installation is almost completed you

- [01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=4142) see. Let's also download the files to download the&nbsp; files we are going to use SwarmUI model downloader

- [01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=4147) extract here. Massed Compute already has SwarmUI&nbsp; so that you don't need to install but if you want

- [01:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=4154) you can install. So Massed Compute model downloads&nbsp; here I will copy copy paste and open terminal and

- [01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=4163) paste. Okay it is going to install and start&nbsp; the model downloader this is really fast.

- [01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=4169) I will download files into the SwarmUI folder but&nbsp; I will make them to be used by the ComfyUI as well

- [01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=4179) like in the Windows. So I will have the access to&nbsp; the files from both applications. You see it is

- [01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=4185) currently using this as a base path this is where&nbsp; the SwarmUI installed in Massed Compute. So let's

- [01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=4194) download LTX 2 bundle download all. The download&nbsp; is also really fast so it started. Before I start

- [01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=4203) the ComfyUI instance I am going to do a change.&nbsp; Okay it is already installed. It took like 1

- [01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=4208) minutes. Go back to ComfyUI and you will see that&nbsp; there is extra model paths.yaml file open it and

- [01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=4218) this is the base path I am going to change this&nbsp; into this. Okay. Let me zoom in. Okay can I zoom

- [01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=4225) in? No. So this is the path where I want ComfyUI&nbsp; to read model files save it. Okay it is not saved

- [01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=4234) yet it is saving right now. Okay it is saved.&nbsp; Then copy this and paste into ComfyUI folder.

- [01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=4242) Then return back to Massed Compute instructions.&nbsp; I am first going to show ComfyUI usage then we

- [01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=4248) will see in SwarmUI. Okay then we are going to&nbsp; use this command to start this one so copy this

- [01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=4258) open a new terminal inside this folder ComfyUI&nbsp; version 78. This is our main installation folder

- [01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=4266) paste. And it will start the ComfyUI. You can&nbsp; see the messages in here. Always look for the

- [01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=4274) CMD to see the accurate messages. You see it is&nbsp; loading everything properly with torch 2.9.1 and

- [01:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=4282) CUDA 13. It is loaded. How to access this from our&nbsp; computer? For accessing it I am going to use this

- [01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=4291) URL copy link and in here type 8888 like this and&nbsp; hit enter. Because it has started in this port as

- [01:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=4301) you can see oh actually this is the port not 8888&nbsp; so let's make it like this yes. So now I am able

- [01:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=4309) to access the ComfyUI running in Massed Compute&nbsp; from my Windows computer. The rest is same as in

- [01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=4318) the Windows tutorial part I am going to just&nbsp; load my preset for example audio to lip sync.

- [01:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=4325) Yes perfectly loaded this is running on the Massed&nbsp; Compute. I am going to choose my demo files like

- [01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=4333) this one. Let's choose our audio file this one.&nbsp; Then set this as in the Windows 45 seconds 1081

- [01:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=4345) frames and I need to type my prompt as usual&nbsp; this is my prompt and run generate. Now let's

- [01:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=4356) see the speed of beginning the model loading&nbsp; and everything. Okay it is already loaded.

- [01:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=4363) It is going to start processing in a moment.&nbsp; The speed of Massed Compute is unchallenged.

- [01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=4369) Not SimplePod not RunPod nothing can match the&nbsp; disk speed of the Massed Compute it already

- [01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=4375) started generating so the whole process takes&nbsp; like 5 minutes once you done it. You will get

- [01:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=4383) used to it you can use the Massed Compute all the&nbsp; time if you don't have a powerful GPU this is one

- [01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=4388) of my recommended cloud server provider. So we&nbsp; are almost done to get 45 seconds HD video. It

- [01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=4398) is taking like 1 minutes lesser than 1 minutes to&nbsp; generate. We can see the whole process live while

- [01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=4405) I am recording. Everything is so transparent.&nbsp; So it is now VAE decoding. Let's see the output

- [01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=4413) in here so it is going to do video combine this&nbsp; is running on cloud not on my machine. But I am

- [01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=4419) using it from my computer. And it is almost&nbsp; ready. Yes. Yes it is ready let's see it.

- [01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=4435) So you can right click and save as&nbsp; the video like right click and save

- [01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=4440) preview or it is also saved in the outputs&nbsp; folder inside ComfyUI inside output so the

- [01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=4449) video is here I can copy this and move it&nbsp; into ThinLinc client you see it is here

- [01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=4456) this is with audio. So save preview will also&nbsp; download the video into your computer as well.

- [01:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=4466) So how to use SwarmUI with this ComfyUI&nbsp; installation in Massed Compute? I am going to

- [01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=4472) close my ComfyUI and Ctrl Alt D it will minimize&nbsp; everything. You see we have RunPod stable SwarmUI

- [01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=4481) update this is actually latest version of SwarmUI&nbsp; and it will update it alternatively you can also

- [01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=4487) use the new installer from here but this is&nbsp; working pretty good so it will update SwarmUI

- [01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=4496) then go to server backends and change this.&nbsp; You should use new installed ComfyUI always

- [01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=4502) so it is here ComfyUI Ctrl L it will select the&nbsp; path Ctrl C and edit this and paste it and then

- [01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=4512) main.py then in here this is like this main.py&nbsp; then in here --use-sage-attention and save. We are

- [01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=4523) ready but we need to check the models are already&nbsp; here since I have downloaded them already into the

- [01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=4554) SwarmUI folder I need to check the Lora folder&nbsp; where it is. So it is Lora here. Choose file.

- [01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=4560) The presets are here amazing SwarmUI&nbsp; presets import refresh sort by name.

- [01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=4567) Now I can use the preset that I want for&nbsp; example LTX 2 text to video direct apply

- [01:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=4576) always quick tools reset params to default then&nbsp; direct apply. Then type your prompt a spaceship

- [01:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=4583) going in space with cinematic background music.&nbsp; Okay let's select our aspect ratio and generate.

- [01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=4593) So the usage is exactly same as in the Windows&nbsp; I am not repeating in details please do not

- [01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=4599) skip those parts. But this is running on the&nbsp; cloud machine you can see that it will start

- [01:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=4606) the processing immediately on Massed Compute.&nbsp; This is fast and I can generate very long videos

- [01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=4613) this way advanced options text to video. I can&nbsp; make this 481 frames let's play this one.

- [01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkXrYezeEDc&t=4622) So you see it is working amazing.&nbsp; Please like and subscribe. Join
