### Video Transcription


- [00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=2) hello dear students welcome to the lecture 17 of responsive web design with

- [00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=5) lecture 17 of responsive web design with asp.net 5 and then we see pattern and

- [00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=7) asp.net 5 and then we see pattern and bootstrap 5.

- [00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=8) bootstrap 5. uh so we were left at popovers of

- [00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=11) uh so we were left at popovers of a bootstrap uh before doing that let's

- [00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=15) a bootstrap uh before doing that let's start with cloning our

- [00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=35) and meanwhile it is getting open as we can

- [00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=37) can continue reading

- [00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=45) okay okay so pop overs overlap

- [00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=54) overview things to know when using the popover plug-in

- [00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=56) popover plug-in popovers rely on the third party library

- [00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=59) popovers rely on the third party library popper for positioning

- [00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=61) popper for positioning you must include popper.minjs before

- [00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=64) you must include popper.minjs before bootstrap.js

- [00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=65) bootstrap.js or use

- [00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=71) bootstrap.bundle.minjs.bootstrap.bundle.js which contains popper in order for

- [00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=72) which contains popper in order for popovers to work

- [00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=74) popovers to work this is the bundle that we have already

- [00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=78) this is the bundle that we have already included in our project therefore it

- [00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=80) included in our project therefore it will

- [00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=81) will work it is working actually we have

- [00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=83) work it is working actually we have already tested that

- [00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=86) already tested that popovers require the tooltip plug-in as

- [00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=88) popovers require the tooltip plug-in as a dependency

- [00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=90) a dependency popovers are opt-in for performance

- [00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=92) popovers are opt-in for performance reasons so you must initialize them

- [00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=94) reasons so you must initialize them yourself

- [00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=96) yourself so these are not automatically

- [00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=98) so these are not automatically initialized we have to initialize them

- [00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=100) initialized we have to initialize them ourselves zero length title and content

- [00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=104) ourselves zero length title and content values will never show a popover

- [00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=107) values will never show a popover specify container body to avoid

- [00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=109) specify container body to avoid rendering problems in more complex

- [00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=111) rendering problems in more complex components

- [00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=112) components like our input groups button groups etc

- [00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=116) like our input groups button groups etc triggering popovers on hidden elements

- [00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=118) triggering popovers on hidden elements will not work

- [00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=120) will not work popovers four dot disabled or disabled

- [00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=122) popovers four dot disabled or disabled elements must be triggered on a wrapper

- [00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=124) elements must be triggered on a wrapper element

- [00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=126) element when triggered from anchors that wrap

- [00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=128) when triggered from anchors that wrap across multiple lines

- [00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=129) across multiple lines popovers will be centered between the

- [00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=131) popovers will be centered between the anchors overall width

- [00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=133) anchors overall width use text no wrap on your a greater than

- [00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=136) use text no wrap on your a greater than s to avoid this behavior

- [00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=139) s to avoid this behavior popovers must be hidden before their

- [00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=141) popovers must be hidden before their corresponding elements have been removed

- [00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=143) corresponding elements have been removed from the dom

- [00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=144) from the dom so you have to hide them before remove

- [00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=147) so you have to hide them before remove the element that

- [00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=149) the element that they are binded

- [00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=155) okay let's rename our project as usual

- [00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=227) okay oh we also need to name this with controller extension

- [00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=235) actually name appending okay and yeah let's add

- [00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=245) director by the way i have to remove root from lecture

- [00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=247) root from lecture 16 otherwise it would complete okay

- [00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=250) 16 otherwise it would complete okay everything is ready

- [00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=251) everything is ready and let's open our index let's save this

- [00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=256) and let's open our index let's save this close all other tabs

- [00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=260) close all other tabs okay now we can start our examples so

- [00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=263) okay now we can start our examples so you see we can

- [00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=264) you see we can we need to initialize them

- [00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=269) we need to initialize them like this

- [00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=272) like this so let's copy this pop over

- [00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=276) so let's copy this pop over here and

- [00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=279) here and now i need to initialize it so

- [00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=282) now i need to initialize it so where is the pop over okay here the

- [00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=285) where is the pop over okay here the content of popover

- [00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=286) content of popover database content and

- [00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=290) database content and i need to initialize it as

- [00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=298) of course the script therefore i need to visualize it right pop over neighbors

- [00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=301) visualize it right pop over neighbors example pop over

- [00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=305) example pop over so it is using class example pop over

- [00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=307) so it is using class example pop over but

- [00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=309) but we don't have that yet in our

- [00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=313) we don't have that yet in our [Music]

- [00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=324) let's give an id to this or

- [00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=332) let's add an extra class here pop class

- [00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=340) like this and i'm going to use that as a selector

- [00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=349) this is not the way we did it let me check from our picture 16 we had a

- [00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=353) check from our picture 16 we had a working example here

- [00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=360) so yeah it was like this this is a better way

- [00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=361) better way so you see we are using when the

- [00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=363) so you see we are using when the document load is ready

- [00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=367) document load is ready we are selecting

- [00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=370) we are selecting database toggle equal pop over like this

- [00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=373) database toggle equal pop over like this so we are getting all database toggle

- [00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=376) so we are getting all database toggle elements which are equal to pop over

- [00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=380) elements which are equal to pop over with this a jquery selector and then we

- [00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=383) with this a jquery selector and then we call pop over

- [00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=385) call pop over command this is the most

- [00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=390) command this is the most optimal way

- [00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=395) it will initialize all of the pop workers at once

- [00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=401) so can we have multiple pop overs at the top at

- [00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=402) top at any time um

- [00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=418) that's ready to open okay let's stop it

- [00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=426) [Music] let's add some

- [00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=437) okay and one

- [00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=485) oh i see the error is coming from tooltip because we have no

- [00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=493) tooltip because we have no uh tooltip right now

- [00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=511) so let's replace by the way you see there is lecture 15 written here

- [00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=514) there is lecture 15 written here uh in order to fix that we need to

- [00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=517) uh in order to fix that we need to change our

- [00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=518) change our um

- [00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=521) um under shaded layout cshtml

- [00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=524) under shaded layout cshtml here i need to change it as lecture 17

- [00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=533) and okay so it says popover is not a function

- [00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=540) and did we include anything else here in lecture 16

- [00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=554) oh i see we had included but these are different things

- [00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=557) but these are different things yeah this is table jump related

- [00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=560) yeah this is table jump related stop and

- [00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=576) yeah we don't have that let's check out layout in the layout we

- [00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=579) let's check out layout in the layout we have

- [00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=580) have javascript booster bundle mean so we

- [00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=583) javascript booster bundle mean so we already have

- [00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=585) already have bootstrap bundle it also says we need to

- [00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=589) bootstrap bundle it also says we need to have a tooltip plugin

- [00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=592) have a tooltip plugin and is this a different thing

- [00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=637) oh you can't see it here oh i see it here

- [00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=639) here so they have used

- [00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=640) so they have used [Music]

- [00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=643) [Music] document query circuit all this power

- [00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=645) document query circuit all this power for each function you will swap up over

- [00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=647) for each function you will swap up over okay

- [00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=648) okay they have used this for their pop over

- [00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=653) they have used this for their pop over and you want ready documentaries like

- [00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=658) and you want ready documentaries like this

- [00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=664) okay let's test this if it is working or not

- [00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=674) i see so you see it says that the integrity attribute is not

- [00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=679) the integrity attribute is not verified that was let's remove that

- [00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=682) verified that was let's remove that integrity

- [00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=683) integrity from

- [00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=695) it is oh it is here let's remove it now it should it shouldn't get local

- [00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=703) of course i need to refresh okay okay now no errors and now it is working

- [00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=706) now no errors and now it is working amazing we can have both of them and

- [00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=711) amazing we can have both of them and what about our previous selectors like

- [00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=715) what about our previous selectors like this

- [00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=716) this and yeah still working okay

- [00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=721) and yeah still working okay so it was related to secret blocking to

- [00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=723) so it was related to secret blocking to it integrity check

- [00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=725) it integrity check and once i have removed it it is working

- [00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=729) and once i have removed it it is working i don't know maybe we have changed

- [00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=730) i don't know maybe we have changed something so it

- [00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=732) something so it affected its integrity and you see we

- [00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=735) affected its integrity and you see we can have multiple pop overs they are not

- [00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=737) can have multiple pop overs they are not getting close

- [00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=738) getting close by default when we click somewhere else

- [00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=741) by default when we click somewhere else uh we need to

- [00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=742) uh we need to click it again for pop over to get

- [00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=750) close let's continue with the example here

- [00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=752) here you see there can be four directions uh

- [00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=755) you see there can be four directions uh like here

- [00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=758) like here okay let's close this

- [00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=761) okay let's close this i can close this

- [00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=768) okay and dismiss on next click okay so we can also set that

- [00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=770) we can also set that uh you probably already

- [00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=773) uh you probably already remembered that in the previous lectures

- [00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=782) so it must have [Music]

- [00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=784) [Music] okay database trigger focus i think this

- [00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=787) okay database trigger focus i think this is the

- [00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=788) is the keyboard so let's make

- [00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=791) keyboard so let's make one of them dismissible okay here

- [00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=795) one of them dismissible okay here uh this misa will

- [00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=799) uh this misa will uh to make it dismissible i am adding

- [00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=801) uh to make it dismissible i am adding database trigger

- [00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=804) database trigger when i refresh okay this is dismissible

- [00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=806) when i refresh okay this is dismissible you see

- [00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=807) you see when i click somewhere else it is

- [00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=809) when i click somewhere else it is getting dismissed and this is not

- [00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=811) getting dismissed and this is not for this you have to click here all

- [00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=814) for this you have to click here all right

- [00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=815) right and disabled elements so disable it

- [00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=819) and disabled elements so disable it pop over automatically getting

- [00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=822) pop over automatically getting triggered that's

- [00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=825) triggered that's when you hover your mouse

- [00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=829) when you hover your mouse like here and auto let's

- [00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=832) like here and auto let's dismiss it so it has database trigger

- [00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=835) dismiss it so it has database trigger hover

- [00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=836) hover and focus

- [00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=844) since it is the same lot you see for default we don't provide any

- [00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=846) you see for default we don't provide any triggers and by default it is being

- [00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=849) triggers and by default it is being uh click triggers

- [00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=853) uh click triggers so let's write our notes as usual

- [00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=857) so let's write our notes as usual in extra 17

- [00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=866) and also initialize them and

- [00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=881) all right let's continue to the next okay which is progress

- [00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=899) correcting documentation and examples for using

- [00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=901) documentation and examples for using bootstrap custom progress bars featuring

- [00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=903) bootstrap custom progress bars featuring support for stacked bars

- [00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=905) support for stacked bars animated backgrounds and text labels

- [00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=908) animated backgrounds and text labels on this okay so how it looks how

- [00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=911) on this okay so how it looks how it works progress components are built

- [00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=915) it works progress components are built with two html elements

- [00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=917) with two html elements some css to set the width and a few

- [00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=919) some css to set the width and a few attributes

- [00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=921) attributes we don't use the html5 progress element

- [00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=923) we don't use the html5 progress element ensuring you can stack progress bars

- [00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=926) ensuring you can stack progress bars animate them and place text labels over

- [00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=928) animate them and place text labels over them

- [00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=929) them we use the dot progress as a wrapper to

- [00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=932) we use the dot progress as a wrapper to indicate the max value of the progress

- [00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=934) indicate the max value of the progress bar

- [00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=935) bar we use the inner dot progress bar to

- [00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=937) we use the inner dot progress bar to indicate the progress so far

- [00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=940) indicate the progress so far the dot progress bar requires an inline

- [00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=943) the dot progress bar requires an inline style utility class

- [00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=944) style utility class or custom css to set their width

- [00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=948) or custom css to set their width the dot progress bar also requires some

- [00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=950) the dot progress bar also requires some role and aria attributes to make it

- [00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=952) role and aria attributes to make it accessible

- [00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=954) accessible put that all together and you have the

- [00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=956) put that all together and you have the following examples

- [00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=957) following examples okay let's copy them and test them

- [00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=962) okay let's copy them and test them so we have div class progress path

- [00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=965) so we have div class progress path progress as a main wrapper than we have

- [00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=968) progress as a main wrapper than we have in line

- [00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=969) in line progress bar role progress bar idea

- [00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=972) progress bar role progress bar idea value now is 0

- [00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=973) value now is 0 which means what kind of percentage

- [00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=976) which means what kind of percentage value it has

- [00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=978) value it has and

- [00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=983) uh actually this is really this may be related to

- [00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=984) related to screen readers or not i'm not sure

- [00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=989) screen readers or not i'm not sure and it has value marks

- [00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=992) and it has value marks okay so this is probably

- [00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=996) okay so this is probably yeah related to the screen readers i

- [00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=999) yeah related to the screen readers i believe it won't

- [00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=1001) believe it won't have any effect when i remove them

- [00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=1009) okay and of course i will need to have

- [00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=1024) some separation because they are pretty much stacked

- [00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=1027) because they are pretty much stacked and let's also have

- [00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=1031) and let's also have some new line between them

- [00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=1039) some new line between them okay yeah idea uh this area label is

- [00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=1042) okay yeah idea uh this area label is just for screen readers

- [00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=1045) just for screen readers and when you set their width like this

- [00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=1048) and when you set their width like this it means

- [00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=1049) it means how much person is progressing

- [00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=1059) also we can have we can use this uh width as well but

- [00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=1062) we can use this uh width as well but that is

- [00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=1064) that is it doesn't have all it has only 0 25

- [00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=1068) it doesn't have all it has only 0 25 50 75 and 100

- [00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=1072) 50 75 and 100 okay so how can we also have

- [00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=1080) a label it is pretty simple like this so let's say our progress is 12 percent

- [00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=1099) is completed how it looks and

- [00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=1103) how it looks and some longer text

- [00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=1112) okay yeah you see you cannot see the rest of

- [00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=1113) rest of it if the text is over

- [00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=1117) it if the text is over dash and what about if you make it like

- [00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=1120) dash and what about if you make it like this

- [00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=1128) yeah so whichever the site you put your text it will be visible there

- [00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=1136) and you can also set head custom head like this so let's set a

- [00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=1140) custom head like this so let's set a custom head

- [00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=1142) custom head inside style for example height

- [00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=1146) inside style for example height 40 pixels

- [00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=1151) 40 pixels and where it is

- [00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=1161) okay why this isn't working because i think we need to set the

- [00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=1162) think we need to set the head in here

- [00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=1178) we can also have different uh backgrounds these are the usual

- [00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=1182) backgrounds these are the usual utility classes or bootstrap

- [00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=1192) for example i added here and it changes like that i can also change i think the

- [00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=1195) like that i can also change i think the progress bar

- [00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=1196) progress bar as bg dot

- [00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=1199) as bg dot dangerous yeah

- [00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=1203) dangerous yeah okay and you can also stack

- [00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=1207) okay and you can also stack multiple bars like this

- [00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=1220) okay let's stack multiple bars and you can write different uh

- [00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=1224) and you can write different uh texts inside them like 15 percent

- [00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=1228) texts inside them like 15 percent 30 percent and 20 percent

- [00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=1241) yeah actually this is being 45 percent and this is being 65

- [00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=1244) and this is being 65 when you take it from the zero

- [00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=1248) when you take it from the zero okay and you can also have stripe it

- [00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=1253) okay and you can also have stripe it so we add bar striper to

- [00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=1256) so we add bar striper to our progress bar class

- [00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=1259) our progress bar class here like this

- [00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=1262) here like this and it becomes striped but it is zero so

- [00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=1266) and it becomes striped but it is zero so we need to add some weight to this

- [00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=1281) yeah you see and we can also have animation

- [00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=1296) like uh it is added to the inside progress part so

- [00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=1298) progress part so here however it requires some activation

- [00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=1302) here however it requires some activation probably

- [00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=1310) let's see for animation of course probably we also need

- [00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=1333) so database toggle button id animated progress ic

- [00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=1346) and let's add animation to be able to have animation

- [00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=1356) we need to have an id so the id it takes is

- [00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=1360) so the id it takes is animated progress

- [00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=1431) this may be inside their javascript file which they include here here

- [00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=1434) which they include here here so you see when it's clicked

- [00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=1437) so you see when it's clicked it adds an event listener

- [00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=1442) it adds an event listener which adds progress were animated

- [00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=1446) which adds progress were animated oh it's called toggle

- [00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=1466) i see so on click [Music]

- [00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=1469) [Music] we can have onclick method on click

- [00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=1484) [Music] progress

- [00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=1487) progress animate they are here the inside thing

- [00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=1492) animate they are here the inside thing i mean this is

- [00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=1501) so on click we can execute a javascript method

- [00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=1504) a javascript method animate bash

- [00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=1511) okay and for animate part let's write a

- [00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=1514) animate part let's write a method here function

- [00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=1529) jquery it will select this class

- [00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=1533) it will select this class and it will call toggle method

- [00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=1545) okay oh by default it is animating i see so when you add this

- [00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=1548) so when you add this it is automatically animating if i

- [00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=1551) it is automatically animating if i remove this

- [00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=1552) remove this [Music]

- [00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=1554) [Music] and

- [00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=1556) and yeah it stops animation

- [00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=1559) yeah it stops animation so to be able to have it animating

- [00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=1569) id equal to animate i need to add this class so what i'm

- [00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=1571) i need to add this class so what i'm going to do is

- [00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=1574) going to do is pick this as animate and

- [00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=1578) pick this as animate and add a class okay you see there is add

- [00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=1581) add a class okay you see there is add class

- [00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=1583) class like this okay okay

- [00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=1586) like this okay okay and

- [00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=1591) so it will start animation however it won't remove it to be able to remove

- [00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=1593) won't remove it to be able to remove it what we need to do is

- [00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=1598) it what we need to do is this okay if

- [00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=1613) press class this then we need to remove glass

- [00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=1632) and then we need to return okay to to be able to return of course we need

- [00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=1634) to be able to return of course we need to encapsulate it like this

- [00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=1638) to encapsulate it like this and if it doesn't have classic it will

- [00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=1641) and if it doesn't have classic it will continue to execute

- [00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=1645) continue to execute you see now i can animate it or remove

- [00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=1647) you see now i can animate it or remove it

- [00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=1653) okay and okay that's it

- [00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=1661) okay so progress bars progress um

- [00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=1703) animated stripes okay that's it let's continue to scroll spy

- [00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=1710) okay spy automatically update bootstrap

- [00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=1713) spy automatically update bootstrap navigation or list group components

- [00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=1715) navigation or list group components based on scroll position to indicate

- [00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=1717) based on scroll position to indicate which link is currently active in the

- [00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=1719) which link is currently active in the viewport

- [00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=1720) viewport yeah i have seen examples of this

- [00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=1723) yeah i have seen examples of this actually

- [00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=1729) i don't have any memorized website right now to show what i have seen

- [00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=1730) now to show what i have seen example of this how it works

- [00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=1734) example of this how it works scroll spy has a few requirements to

- [00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=1736) scroll spy has a few requirements to function properly

- [00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=1739) function properly it must be used on a bootstrap nav

- [00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=1741) it must be used on a bootstrap nav component or list group

- [00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=1744) component or list group scroll spy requires position relative on

- [00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=1746) scroll spy requires position relative on the element you're spying on

- [00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=1748) the element you're spying on usually the body anchors a are required

- [00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=1751) usually the body anchors a are required and must point to an element with that

- [00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=1753) and must point to an element with that id

- [00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=1755) id when successfully implemented your nav

- [00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=1757) when successfully implemented your nav or list group will update accordingly

- [00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=1759) or list group will update accordingly moving the dot active class from one

- [00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=1761) moving the dot active class from one item to the next based on their

- [00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=1763) item to the next based on their associated targets

- [00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=1766) associated targets containers and keyboard access

- [00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=1769) containers and keyboard access if you're making a scrollable container

- [00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=1771) if you're making a scrollable container other than the body

- [00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=1773) other than the body be sure to have a height set and

- [00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=1774) be sure to have a height set and overflow eye scroll

- [00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=1776) overflow eye scroll applied to it alongside a tab index

- [00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=1778) applied to it alongside a tab index equals zero to ensure keyboard access

- [00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=1781) equals zero to ensure keyboard access okay so there's an example let's test

- [00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=1784) okay so there's an example let's test that example

- [00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=1803) you see when i click it it goes to the dead position with adding this

- [00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=1807) dead position with adding this hashtag to the end of to url

- [00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=1811) hashtag to the end of to url but where it was close by here

- [00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=1820) okay h4 id second heading i see so when we add this it is

- [00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=1824) i see so when we add this it is just adding this to the end of the

- [00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=1828) just adding this to the end of the url and

- [00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=1836) url and okay we can't see it so let's add it to

- [00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=1838) okay we can't see it so let's add it to the bottom of the page

- [00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=1857) let's add multiple of them to uh of course these cause some problems

- [00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=1864) course these cause some problems um [Music]

- [00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=1868) [Music] okay um

- [00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=1893) okay we need to remove extra one here but now this is what i what i didn't

- [00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=1897) but now this is what i what i didn't mean

- [00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=1898) mean when we changed this scroll it was

- [00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=1901) when we changed this scroll it was highlighting somewhere around here

- [00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=1903) highlighting somewhere around here let's continue with the example

- [00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=1907) let's continue with the example okay

- [00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=1915) i see so this is working but you see

- [00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=1919) but you see our example is not this is probably due

- [00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=1922) our example is not this is probably due to

- [00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=1929) [Music] we don't have

- [00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=1935) we don't have such area

- [00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=1944) which is called this add a b plus equal to containers and let's set

- [00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=1948) containers and let's set height

- [00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=1958) okay max height equal to 100 pixel and then it should become scrollable

- [00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=1960) and then it should become scrollable auto scroll

- [00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=2034) definitely this example is incompleted given here let's check from source code

- [00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=2075) yeah okay this is the correct example so [Music]

- [00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=2101) okay so it has h to example div class be the example now for example

- [00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=2105) div class be the example now for example now when our light bg.ph3

- [00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=2113) was still looks like we are missing something here

- [00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=2123) okay i think we need to set our number fixed

- [00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=2142) now we were setting our number fixed here

- [00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=2153) from the okay this is 0.4 let's open 0.5

- [00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=2159) 0.4 let's open 0.5 fix it so for

- [00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=2162) fix it so for fix it we add

- [00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=2182) ah we have to fix it uh top to the null bar

- [00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=2184) bar which is here's okay

- [00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=2188) which is here's okay and then we refresh

- [00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=2200) inside yeah not working so why we can't make

- [00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=2204) yeah not working so why we can't make the example

- [00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=2233) okay uh let me check this from source codes

- [00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=2242) of this number is top of it or here

- [00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=2254) so you see it has database targets now our example

- [00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=2255) our example so let's just copy this

- [00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=2263) and paste it to our example here

- [00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=2270) okay so there are some key issues uh first the number is just above

- [00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=2273) first the number is just above uh the div which has database by scroll

- [00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=2279) uh the div which has database by scroll database target number example two which

- [00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=2282) database target number example two which is written here

- [00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=2284) is written here as an id and database offset 0

- [00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=2288) as an id and database offset 0 and classic close by example and this is

- [00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=2291) and classic close by example and this is the custom plus probably they have and

- [00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=2292) the custom plus probably they have and top index 0

- [00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=2295) top index 0 so now when i refresh it will

- [00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=2298) so now when i refresh it will work i'm pretty sure but so it is

- [00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=2301) work i'm pretty sure but so it is related to this i think this is related

- [00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=2303) related to this i think this is related to its

- [00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=2304) to its style 8

- [00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=2308) style 8 let's make it 300 pixels

- [00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=2312) let's make it 300 pixels refresh okay i think

- [00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=2315) refresh okay i think i also need to add

- [00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=2326) sucral overflow i auto let's refresh

- [00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=2330) auto let's refresh okay and okay there's still something

- [00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=2334) okay and okay there's still something wrong

- [00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=2342) um but maybe still wrong

- [00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=2352) okay we have idea of our number and

- [00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=2362) we have database for scroll target as example 2

- [00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=2381) okay so why not working

- [00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=2390) okay it is going to the first heading second heading and

- [00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=2392) second heading and 15 or something you see

- [00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=2396) 15 or something you see however they are not highlighted

- [00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=2406) i think it is because they are wrapped inside another class not the body itself

- [00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=2418) so the key issue is related to probably it's across by example let's see this

- [00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=2420) it's across by example let's see this class

- [00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=2422) class okay it has position relative height

- [00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=2425) okay it has position relative height and marginal here so we need to set

- [00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=2428) and marginal here so we need to set position relative

- [00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=2431) position relative [Music]

- [00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=2445) let's refresh okay now it has appeared all right that's it you see when you

- [00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=2448) all right that's it you see when you work with the examples

- [00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=2449) work with the examples provided here sometimes you need to

- [00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=2465) okay there is nothing oh you see it also told us to add

- [00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=2469) it also told us to add body position relative otherwise it

- [00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=2471) body position relative otherwise it won't work

- [00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=2472) won't work but we have discovered is already

- [00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=2474) but we have discovered is already ourselves

- [00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=2481) and okay that's it if you want to use it you

- [00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=2483) okay that's it if you want to use it you can look more

- [00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=2508) example with nested now this is just saying nothing different

- [00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=2517) by the way when you click two it's not working very well

- [00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=2519) working very well yeah wait even the example doesn't work

- [00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=2529) and this group is just you using this group nothing

- [00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=2533) is just you using this group nothing [Music]

- [00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=2534) [Music] different

- [00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=2550) requirement okay and the sippiness

- [00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=2561) spinners indicate the loading state of a component or page with bootstrap

- [00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=2563) component or page with bootstrap spinners

- [00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=2563) spinners built entirely with html css and no

- [00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=2567) built entirely with html css and no javascript

- [00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=2568) javascript okay we had i have shown example of

- [00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=2571) okay we had i have shown example of loading

- [00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=2572) loading spinners or image

- [00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=2575) spinners or image in the previous lectures but we had used

- [00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=2579) in the previous lectures but we had used a

- [00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=2580) a an image for that task probably it is

- [00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=2583) an image for that task probably it is still here let me see

- [00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=2585) here let me see [Music]

- [00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=2593) okay here fidget spinner and instead of that in which now we are

- [00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=2595) instead of that in which now we are going to use

- [00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=2596) going to use uh the spinner of a

- [00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=2601) uh the spinner of a bootstrap it's a built-in spinach that

- [00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=2603) bootstrap it's a built-in spinach that you can just

- [00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=2605) you can just call that as a class here

- [00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=2608) call that as a class here visually hidden loading

- [00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=2616) and you see loading text is visually hidden

- [00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=2617) hidden it just it is just for

- [00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=2629) let's say screen readers to read you see the visually hidden has

- [00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=2632) you see the visually hidden has i think display

- [00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=2638) visibility hidden of let's see which class is that

- [00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=2644) so visual hidden means that um [Music]

- [00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=2646) [Music] yeah its position is absolute and margin

- [00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=2650) yeah its position is absolute and margin -1 which means it is not inside the

- [00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=2653) -1 which means it is not inside the screen it is at the

- [00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=2655) screen it is at the top left of the screen with -1

- [00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=2661) top left of the screen with -1 margin if i change margin of this like

- [00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=2665) margin if i change margin of this like 11 okay

- [00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=2669) 11 okay um i also need to change its

- [00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=2673) um i also need to change its width and height

- [00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=2677) width and height position absolute and now it works

- [00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=2679) position absolute and now it works you've seen loading

- [00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=2680) you've seen loading it is even spinning as well

- [00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=2683) it is even spinning as well all right and there's growing spinach so

- [00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=2688) all right and there's growing spinach so different classes

- [00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=2689) different classes you can use all of them alignments

- [00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=2693) you can use all of them alignments like this which has a margin of 5

- [00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=2698) like this which has a margin of 5 placements i wonder if they have size

- [00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=2701) placements i wonder if they have size yeah

- [00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=2701) yeah they also have size you can even set

- [00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=2705) they also have size you can even set custom sizes that is great so let's

- [00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=2721) okay width equal to 50 pixels and head equal to 50 pixels

- [00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=2733) okay you see the first one has 50 pixels with an 8 and you can even

- [00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=2737) with an 8 and you can even show simply inside the button

- [00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=2745) so it's it is this can be also used when you post back

- [00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=2746) you post back and disable button for from clicking

- [00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=2750) and disable button for from clicking so it will show loading button like this

- [00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=2753) so it will show loading button like this uh you see it is not clickable to make it

- [00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=2756) you see it is not clickable to make it non-click not clickable we add disabled

- [00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=2759) non-click not clickable we add disabled role here

- [00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=2762) role here and okay that's it

- [00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=2768) so how you activate spinner is totally related to you when you post page to the

- [00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=2771) related to you when you post page to the server

- [00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=2773) server you need to add necessary clusters to

- [00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=2775) you need to add necessary clusters to those elements

- [00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=2777) those elements and remove them from those classes when

- [00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=2779) and remove them from those classes when the

- [00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=2780) the prospect is completed we have made

- [00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=2784) prospect is completed we have made example of that actually

- [00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=2786) example of that actually the previous lectures you can look for

- [00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=2788) the previous lectures you can look for them

- [00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=2803) however for my developed games i use

- [00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=2806) developed games i use a web pa spinach i mean an image spinach

- [00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=2811) a web pa spinach i mean an image spinach because it looks i think cooler

- [00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=2817) because it looks i think cooler okay so growing spinach

- [00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=2826) and alignment placement whatever you want you can

- [00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=2829) placement whatever you want you can always mix

- [00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=2831) always mix losses of bootstrap to obtain

- [00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=2840) different results you can also float text line

- [00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=2850) like here you see it take center that's it there's nothing different here that's

- [00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=2852) it there's nothing different here that's nothing

- [00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=2853) nothing special here

- [00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=2885) okay so toasts push notifications to your

- [00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=2889) toasts push notifications to your visitors with a toast

- [00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=2890) visitors with a toast a lightweight and easily customizable

- [00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=2892) a lightweight and easily customizable alert message

- [00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=2898) toasts are lightweight notifications designed to mimic the push notifications

- [00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=2900) designed to mimic the push notifications that have been popularized by mobile and

- [00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=2902) that have been popularized by mobile and desktop operating systems

- [00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=2904) desktop operating systems they're built with flexbox so they're

- [00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=2906) they're built with flexbox so they're easy to align and position

- [00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=2909) easy to align and position overview things to know when using the

- [00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=2912) overview things to know when using the toast plugin

- [00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=2914) toast plugin toasts are opt-in for performance

- [00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=2916) toasts are opt-in for performance reasons so you must initialize them

- [00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=2918) reasons so you must initialize them yourself

- [00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=2920) yourself toasts will automatically hide if you do

- [00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=2922) toasts will automatically hide if you do not specify autohide

- [00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=2924) not specify autohide false it's also an automatic

- [00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=2933) okay so there are some examples let's start

- [00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=2934) start basic to encourage extensible and

- [00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=2937) basic to encourage extensible and predictable toasts

- [00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=2938) predictable toasts we recommend a header and body toast

- [00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=2941) we recommend a header and body toast headers use display

- [00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=2943) headers use display flex allowing easy alignment of content

- [00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=2945) flex allowing easy alignment of content thanks to our margin and flexbox

- [00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=2947) thanks to our margin and flexbox utilities

- [00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=2949) utilities toasts are as flexible as you need and

- [00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=2951) toasts are as flexible as you need and have very little required markup

- [00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=2954) have very little required markup at a minimum we require a single element

- [00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=2956) at a minimum we require a single element to contain your toasted content

- [00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=2958) to contain your toasted content and strongly encourage a dismiss button

- [00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=2961) and strongly encourage a dismiss button well this looks pretty cool and easy

- [00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=2970) okay something like this and here it is not visible by default so

- [00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=2973) and here it is not visible by default so we need a trigger

- [00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=2985) um okay like this i think i will do it with

- [00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=2988) okay like this i think i will do it with the trigger like this

- [00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=2995) okay so position fixed it says i will [Music]

- [00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=2996) [Music] use

- [00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=2998) use [Music]

- [00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=3016) so what happens if we don't put this it probably still won't work

- [00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=3022) okay to make it work we need to initialize it how to initialize it

- [00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=3024) initialize it how to initialize it let's see

- [00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=3037) okay like this so let's add this code to our

- [00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=3041) let's add this code to our script towards this slice called

- [00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=3043) script towards this slice called document correct host

- [00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=3050) okay uh yeah it should do work i think so let's have page

- [00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=3064) i think i will use this oh i see because we have added it to the

- [00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=3067) oh i see because we have added it to the correct place

- [00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=3068) correct place so let's just use the jquery

- [00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=3072) so let's just use the jquery it will select all toast

- [00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=3081) class elements like this and it will call

- [00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=3086) and it will call um toast yeah

- [00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=3091) um toast yeah i'm on the physical vlog

- [00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=3108) yeah um so toast is not supported

- [00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=3125) no um let's use the

- [00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=3139) maybe it is because we didn't add a position to it

- [00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=3141) position to it so

- [00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=3166) okay okay i still can't see it

- [00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=3232) i think we need to trigger it with a bottom click

- [00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=3236) bottom click so it will be like this toast button on

- [00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=3239) so it will be like this toast button on click

- [00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=3239) click so i see so it returns source list and

- [00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=3244) so i see so it returns source list and from toast each toast show

- [00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=3253) so do we have a button with id id is this so we need to give this id to

- [00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=3258) id is this so we need to give this id to this so this is basically assigning an

- [00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=3262) this so this is basically assigning an event

- [00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=3264) event to this button

- [00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=3271) so when we click it yeah now we can see the toast

- [00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=3272) the toast appearing so does it have auto height

- [00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=3278) appearing so does it have auto height yeah okay it is working

- [00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=3282) yeah okay it is working and so this is a

- [00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=3285) and so this is a height class

- [00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=3292) it has a height button it has a close button

- [00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=3307) sourced i think it hides all the toasts

- [00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=3316) so let's try multiple toasts it was some it was somewhere around here

- [00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=3325) okay toast containers yeah let's try this

- [00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=3333) like this so those containers can contain multiple toasts

- [00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=3335) contain multiple toasts for steadily toast ideally assertive

- [00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=3337) for steadily toast ideally assertive ariata material

- [00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=3339) ariata material database yes gloss

- [00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=3343) database yes gloss meteor cloth it will close the toast

- [00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=3348) meteor cloth it will close the toast i think it closes the party post

- [00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=3352) i think it closes the party post so let's test

- [00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=3356) so let's test yeah they have appeared here

- [00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=3359) yeah they have appeared here by the way they are taking space here it

- [00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=3361) by the way they are taking space here it is

- [00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=3363) is i think it shouldn't be like that

- [00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=3392) oh we can even have middle centers [Music]

- [00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=3419) so it is like this yeah talks i have 15 to have that let's add it here

- [00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=3423) to have that let's add it here we'll toast containers let's refresh

- [00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=3427) we'll toast containers let's refresh oh no we can't even click it

- [00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=3433) oh no we can't even click it let's see the source code

- [00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=3452) maybe we need to put these inside this machine

- [00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=3461) this machine um yes and he is

- [00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=3545) oh i see but this is very based by the way

- [00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=3547) way when i added a bias now it is gone

- [00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=3551) when i added a bias now it is gone to wash

- [00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=3558) wow i see you see after i have added this brt uh

- [00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=3561) after i have added this brt uh depos position relative now it has

- [00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=3564) depos position relative now it has zero height and therefore not taking any

- [00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=3568) zero height and therefore not taking any space and when i click it i can see it

- [00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=3570) space and when i click it i can see it like here

- [00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=3573) like here and if i want to set them

- [00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=3576) and if i want to set them [Music]

- [00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=3580) [Music] center

- [00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=3599) so defects justify content centered and i item center with 100 percent

- [01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=3603) i item center with 100 percent this will be the class of the

- [01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=3614) deep area leave and from here or not okay let's make the container id

- [01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=3617) or not okay let's make the container id like this i'm in the class

- [01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=3620) like this i'm in the class so let's try this way

- [01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=3624) so let's try this way okay still take now they're taking space

- [01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=3627) okay still take now they're taking space again

- [01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=3628) again so we need to keep

- [01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=3656) okay they are centered but they are taking space

- [01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=3683) container position should be relative and

- [01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=3684) and [Music]

- [01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=3687) [Music] okay so the container will be relative

- [01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=3690) okay so the container will be relative which is here

- [01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=3692) which is here and this will help position absolute

- [01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=3696) and this will help position absolute like this so it won't take space

- [01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=3703) and when we click it okay now we can see it however

- [01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=3712) um let's see that's the uh use

- [01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=3727) okay how it makes position

- [01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=3789) i wonder if there is a class for z index for boost up

- [01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=3810) now so we need to add that ourselves okay so it won't get behind

- [01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=3815) okay so it won't get behind yeah uh but the way it

- [01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=3819) yeah uh but the way it is being displayed is not what i want

- [01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=3825) is being displayed is not what i want you see this is the toast position

- [01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=3828) you see this is the toast position relative uh i want to set it

- [01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=3832) relative uh i want to set it center of the page so

- [01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=3838) center of the page so let's see if wrong here i think it was

- [01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=3840) let's see if wrong here i think it was this

- [01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=3841) this somewhere around here

- [01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=3862) manual center here let's try this so we will keep position

- [01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=3866) so we will keep position reality

- [01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=3885) so this way okay it is working but if it is it is taking space or not so let's

- [01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=3888) is it is taking space or not so let's find it out

- [01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=3889) find it out no it is not taking any space zero uh

- [01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=3892) no it is not taking any space zero uh and zero so

- [01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=3893) and zero so this is what we were looking for and now

- [01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=3896) this is what we were looking for and now it is being displayed here i can also

- [01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=3898) it is being displayed here i can also set it

- [01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=3899) set it top right like tab 0

- [01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=3903) top right like tab 0 starts and 0

- [01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=3907) starts and 0 i think it should work

- [01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=3915) okay one of them is visible and the other one is not so

- [01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=3918) other one is not so um top turn and

- [01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=3921) um top turn and 10 it's totally up to you

- [01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=3926) 10 it's totally up to you oh now i can pretty so there's something

- [01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=3965) when we right it like that it is not working as expected

- [01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=3975) the other one is at the top so when we remove this

- [01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=3984) now this is taking space which isn't even

- [01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=3985) even working okay so the position is totally

- [01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=3989) working okay so the position is totally up

- [01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=3990) up to you and

- [01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=3994) to you and if you make it like this

- [01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=4006) i think instead of and i need to use start

- [01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=4082) let's see where it is okay so it is taking space right now

- [01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=4084) taking space right now therefore it is not as we want and the

- [01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=4087) therefore it is not as we want and the closed volumes

- [01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=4088) closed volumes is not working

- [01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=4101) so you need to work with the positioning

- [01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=4105) the positioning because by default they are taking space

- [01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=4108) because by default they are taking space in your

- [01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=4111) in your website

- [01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=4117) therefore you have to be careful with that

- [01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=4128) oh now it is working here so position relative to the very top then

- [01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=4132) position relative to the very top then inside container position absolute top

- [01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=4134) inside container position absolute top zero and zero p three

- [01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=4136) zero and zero p three padding three so this looks like the

- [01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=4139) padding three so this looks like the best

- [01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=4140) best option if you ask me okay

- [01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=4144) option if you ask me okay and yeah that's it about toasts

- [01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=4148) and yeah that's it about toasts so we can also set auto hide false and

- [01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=4152) so we can also set auto hide false and yeah that's it

- [01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=4185) means it blends with their backgrounds i think

- [01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=4187) think so you need to

- [01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=4195) yeah it blocks it down and

- [01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=4202) stacking okay custom content color schemes you

- [01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=4205) okay custom content color schemes you can also have

- [01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=4213) placement is a little bit problematic but we made it work at the

- [01:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=4216) but we made it work at the and yeah

- [01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=4219) and yeah okay so the there is tooltips as a last

- [01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=4223) okay so the there is tooltips as a last component

- [01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=4232) tooltips documentation and examples for adding custom bootstrap tooltips with

- [01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=4248) tooltip plugin tooltips rely on the third-party library

- [01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=4251) tooltips rely on the third-party library popper for positioning

- [01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=4253) popper for positioning you must include

- [01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=4257) popper.minjsbeforebootstrap.js or use

- [01:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=4263) bootstrap.bundle.minjs.bootstrap.bundle.js which contains popper in order for

- [01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=4264) which contains popper in order for tooltips to work

- [01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=4267) tooltips to work tooltips are opt-in for performance

- [01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=4268) tooltips are opt-in for performance reasons so you must initialize them

- [01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=4270) reasons so you must initialize them yourself

- [01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=4272) yourself tooltips with zero length titles are

- [01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=4274) tooltips with zero length titles are never displayed

- [01:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=4276) never displayed specify container body to avoid

- [01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=4279) specify container body to avoid rendering problems in more complex

- [01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=4280) rendering problems in more complex components

- [01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=4281) components like our input groups button groups etc

- [01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=4285) like our input groups button groups etc triggering tool tips on hidden elements

- [01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=4287) triggering tool tips on hidden elements will not work

- [01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=4289) will not work tooltips four dot disabled or disabled

- [01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=4291) tooltips four dot disabled or disabled elements must be triggered on a wrapper

- [01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=4293) elements must be triggered on a wrapper element

- [01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=4295) element when triggered from hyperlinks that span

- [01:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=4297) when triggered from hyperlinks that span multiple lines

- [01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=4298) multiple lines tooltips will be centered okay it is

- [01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=4300) tooltips will be centered okay it is pretty much same

- [01:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=4301) pretty much same as poppers

- [01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=4305) as poppers so we also need to initialize them

- [01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=4308) so we also need to initialize them so let's try

- [01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=4315) and where do we initialize it we initialize it with

- [01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=4323) data we are salty parting it was like that

- [01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=4335) okay you see it appears and it doesn't appear until i click it back

- [01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=4337) it doesn't appear until i click it back alright

- [01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=4338) alright okay okay

- [01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=4348) yeah working there are also options for tooltips

- [01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=4355) um i think can we keep timing and other things

- [01:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=4365) yeah options so there are some options as animation building through

- [01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=4368) as animation building through containers delay you see that you can

- [01:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=4370) containers delay you see that you can have a delay

- [01:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=4372) have a delay uh like

- [01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=4375) uh like this so how do we provide delay to our

- [01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=4379) this so how do we provide delay to our tooltip

- [01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=4392) let's see if there's more examples somebody out here

- [01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=4406) okay database animation i see database delete problem so let's add

- [01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=4409) delete problem so let's add and delete the first one data bs delay

- [01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=4413) and delete the first one data bs delay equal to 1000 here

- [01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=4421) when i refresh okay it pretty much comes immediately and this comes yeah so this

- [01:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=4425) immediately and this comes yeah so this is the way it works

- [01:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=4426) is the way it works that is html so we can upload

- [01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=4429) that is html so we can upload html as well into tooltip what does that

- [01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=4432) html as well into tooltip what does that mean let me show

- [01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=4440) database html equal to true

- [01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=4443) equal to true and in the title let's add an

- [01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=4447) and in the title let's add an hr like this

- [01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=4450) hr like this html let's see how it looks

- [01:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=4455) html let's see how it looks you see now this is working with hr

- [01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=4459) you see now this is working with hr and there is placement

- [01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=4462) and there is placement we can make a placement top right left

- [01:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=4466) we can make a placement top right left it is by default auto uh selector

- [01:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=4470) it is by default auto uh selector template so you see you can have a

- [01:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=4473) template so you see you can have a template as well

- [01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=4479) the template is like this but you can change it

- [01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=4481) change it trigger hover focus you see you can also

- [01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=4485) trigger hover focus you see you can also change trigger as well like click i

- [01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=4488) change trigger as well like click i think manual pull back and

- [01:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=4492) manual pull back and boundary custom class sanitize

- [01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=4500) so it is about sanitization of html alone lists

- [01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=4501) alone lists sanitize offset we can also set offset

- [01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=4505) sanitize offset we can also set offset like

- [01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=4511) 2020 for example interviews offset equal to

- [01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=4516) interviews offset equal to 2020

- [01:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=4525) you see there is some offset right now i can see it

- [01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=4527) can see it and okay so are there anything relating

- [01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=4531) and okay so are there anything relating to this miss no since it is too deep it

- [01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=4533) to this miss no since it is too deep it is automatically getting dismissed

- [01:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=4536) is automatically getting dismissed if you want to remove this mix i think

- [01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=4539) if you want to remove this mix i think you need to have

- [01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=4566) is okay paul strap not

- [01:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=4570) okay paul strap not auto hide tooltip i wonder if this is

- [01:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=4585) oh i see when i initialize it there is trigger hover

- [01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=4613) i see with data delay we can set multiple

- [01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=4651) i see so we need to change uh trigger to hover instead of have over

- [01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=4654) trigger to hover instead of have over focus

- [01:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=4660) and you can also bind events like this height

- [01:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=4662) height but there is no option to disable auto

- [01:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=4664) but there is no option to disable auto hide i think

- [01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=4707) options are up to you okay

- [01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=4720) 12 tips um tooltips errors

- [01:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=4734) okay usage creation

- [01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=4756) okay i think that is enough so enough helpers

- [01:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=4767) clear fix quickly and easily clear floated content within a container by

- [01:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=4769) floated content within a container by adding a clear fix utility

- [01:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=4777) okay so the following example show how the clear fix can be used without the

- [01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=4779) the clear fix can be used without the clay fixed

- [01:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=4780) clay fixed wrapping blue they would not spawn

- [01:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=4782) wrapping blue they would not spawn around buttons which

- [01:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=4783) around buttons which would cause broken layout so let's

- [01:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=4787) would cause broken layout so let's test it the first one with a clear fix

- [01:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=4792) test it the first one with a clear fix and second one without clear fix

- [01:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=4800) okay you see the first one is floated left prototype

- [01:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=4802) left prototype but the other one is um

- [01:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=4805) but the other one is um completely different than the rest

- [01:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=4814) okay and this is about clear with colored links

- [01:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=4816) colored links yeah that's something we already know

- [01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=4832) okay um let me fix color things

- [01:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=4846) right here aspect practical let's test it

- [01:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=4861) okay of course we can see them right now so we need to add some

- [01:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=4863) so we need to add some i think borders

- [01:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=4891) they are taking full space i don't know why

- [01:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=4907) let's add a background to its [Music]

- [01:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=4916) eg dangerous okay i see so based on

- [01:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=4919) okay i see so based on the screen size

- [01:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=4927) you see it is just double of the uh securing resolution so its width

- [01:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=4931) uh securing resolution so its width is 1519

- [01:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=4935) is 1519 and its height is just uh

- [01:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=4939) and its height is just uh half of it so we can have custom

- [01:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=4942) half of it so we can have custom ratio like

- [01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=4956) 15 percent okay so you see it said it's right you according to

- [01:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=4958) it said it's right you according to screen size

- [01:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=4960) screen size uh so it is like this yeah

- [01:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=4963) uh so it is like this yeah so this is about right here

- [01:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=4980) all right and position fix it up fix it button stick it up

- [01:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=4983) fix it up fix it button stick it up you already have all them

- [01:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=5006) and then there is a responses ticket top for example let me show stick it up to

- [01:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=5008) for example let me show stick it up to you

- [01:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=5020) remain dash like this when you get down below its current position so you

- [01:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=5022) down below its current position so you see it's currently positioned here when

- [01:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=5024) see it's currently positioned here when i get down you see it's still here

- [01:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=5029) get down you see it's still here we already have example of that in the

- [01:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=5031) we already have example of that in the previous lecture so what is

- [01:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=5033) previous lecture so what is visually hidden

- [01:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=5040) visually hidden use these helpers to visually hide

- [01:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=5041) visually hide elements but keep them accessible to

- [01:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=5043) elements but keep them accessible to assistive technologies

- [01:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=5046) assistive technologies visually hide an element while still

- [01:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=5048) visually hide an element while still allowing it to be exposed to assistive

- [01:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=5050) allowing it to be exposed to assistive technologies

- [01:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=5051) technologies such as screen readers with dot visually

- [01:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=5053) such as screen readers with dot visually hidden

- [01:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=5054) hidden use dot visually hidden focusable to

- [01:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=5056) use dot visually hidden focusable to visually hide an element by default

- [01:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=5058) visually hide an element by default but to display it when it's focused eg

- [01:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=5060) but to display it when it's focused eg by a keyboard only user

- [01:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=5063) by a keyboard only user dot visually hidden focusable can also

- [01:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=5065) dot visually hidden focusable can also be applied to a container

- [01:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=5067) be applied to a container thanks to focus within the container

- [01:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=5069) thanks to focus within the container will be displayed when any child

- [01:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=5071) will be displayed when any child element of the container receives focus

- [01:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=5074) element of the container receives focus okay so it is like this

- [01:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=5098) and stretch it link so you see entire card is now as a

- [01:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=5102) so you see entire card is now as a single link

- [01:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=5104) single link let's see

- [01:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=5113) okay do style cards and you see i can click everywhere this is so hard to achieve in

- [01:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=5117) everywhere this is so hard to achieve in regular html believe me but i have spent

- [01:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=5120) regular html believe me but i have spent so much time to make some of my links

- [01:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=5122) so much time to make some of my links like this

- [01:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=5123) like this but with a stretched link

- [01:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=5127) but with a stretched link class here it takes the entire

- [01:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=5131) class here it takes the entire uh it makes the entire div

- [01:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=5135) uh it makes the entire div as a stretched link it's awesome believe

- [01:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=5138) as a stretched link it's awesome believe me

- [01:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=5141) me so this is probably javascript you see

- [01:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=5143) so this is probably javascript you see when i click it it's clicking here

- [01:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=5154) when i click it it's clicking here okay multiple links and tap stocks are

- [01:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=5156) okay multiple links and tap stocks are not recommended of course

- [01:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=5158) not recommended of course wow this is so so much uh

- [01:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=5162) wow this is so so much uh i have some future believe me if you are

- [01:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=5163) i have some future believe me if you are working with html you will know that

- [01:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=5168) working with html you will know that and okay carter stretch it link some

- [01:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=5170) and okay carter stretch it link some quick example take some

- [01:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=5171) quick example take some stitching leaving not working because

- [01:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=5173) stitching leaving not working because position relative is added to the link

- [01:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=5177) position relative is added to the link okay so this is about such a thing

- [01:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=5188) and text rank translation it will only show some

- [01:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=5191) it will only show some part of some

- [01:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=5197) part of the text so it will truncate text after two column i think

- [01:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=5209) yeah um yeah this this may be useful but i

- [01:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=5211) yeah this this may be useful but i wouldn't suggest to use

- [01:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=5213) wouldn't suggest to use the text from application

- [01:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=5218) the text from application and then there is utilities api

- [01:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=5228) okay so this is not our topic right now you can look that if you want background

- [01:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=5231) you can look that if you want background background color we already know that

- [01:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=5234) background color we already know that you can also background gradient which

- [01:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=5236) you can also background gradient which is great yeah

- [01:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=5237) is great yeah normally i i suggest you to use big

- [01:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=5240) normally i i suggest you to use big current

- [01:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=5241) current uh gradient

- [01:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=5245) uh gradient so how do we use it so let's

- [01:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=5248) so how do we use it so let's see because gradient is in most cases

- [01:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=5251) see because gradient is in most cases looks better

- [01:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=5259) when i add ps gradient to the class i think it becomes a gradient here

- [01:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=5261) class i think it becomes a gradient here it is not a single

- [01:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=5262) it is not a single color anymore let's add a gradient to

- [01:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=5265) color anymore let's add a gradient to every one of them

- [01:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=5280) oh this is so cool ah yeah they are all gradients right now

- [01:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=5283) ah yeah they are all gradients right now it looks

- [01:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=5283) it looks much better

- [01:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=5293) okay um background colors variant and

- [01:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=5296) variant and yeah there's nothing

- [01:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=5299) yeah there's nothing more important here borders

- [01:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=5303) more important here borders so you can have different border

- [01:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=5307) so you can have different border selecting additive

- [01:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=5308) selecting additive subtractive

- [01:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=5317) border color border bits for the size orders folders you already know them

- [01:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=5320) orders folders you already know them for the size more than weights

- [01:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=5323) for the size more than weights for this color as such

- [01:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=5328) for this color as such okay colors the colors are like this

- [01:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=5331) okay colors the colors are like this you see different text colors

- [01:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=5335) you see different text colors and yeah that's it

- [01:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=5351) display oh display is about what kind of

- [01:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=5355) oh display is about what kind of um display

- [01:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=5360) um display you are expecting i mean in line block

- [01:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=5363) you are expecting i mean in line block inline blog they're all differently

- [01:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=5365) inline blog they're all differently rendered in the browser uh

- [01:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=5369) rendered in the browser uh so this is all about this way you want

- [01:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=5371) so this is all about this way you want it to be like a table or table cell

- [01:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=5373) it to be like a table or table cell table row flex in nine flex

- [01:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=5377) table row flex in nine flex so these are just the

- [01:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=5378) so these are just the [Music]

- [01:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=5380) [Music] display values they are taking d dot non

- [01:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=5383) display values they are taking d dot non block inline block uh

- [01:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=5387) block inline block uh you see table sprint cell this way in

- [01:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=5389) you see table sprint cell this way in print you can also set display in print

- [01:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=5391) print you can also set display in print as well

- [01:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=5393) as well so when user tries to print it will be

- [01:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=5395) so when user tries to print it will be how it will be displayed

- [01:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=5398) how it will be displayed the notation is display and value

- [01:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=5401) the notation is display and value so let's make an example

- [01:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=5405) so let's make an example by default these are display block

- [01:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=5409) by default these are display block therefore they take entire row

- [01:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=5412) therefore they take entire row you see the inline developed replacing

- [01:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=5416) you see the inline developed replacing 90 grit

- [01:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=5417) 90 grit like that

- [01:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=5421) like that anyway if you want to learn more about

- [01:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=5423) anyway if you want to learn more about display

- [01:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=5424) display uh display differences

- [01:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=5431) okay maybe there's an example let's see i think we need to type as css display

- [01:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=5436) i think we need to type as css display differences

- [01:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=5446) okay okay so you see this is inline this is inline

- [01:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=5449) you see this is inline this is inline block

- [01:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=5450) block this is block taking entire row

- [01:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=5454) this is block taking entire row um this is flexbox

- [01:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=5457) um this is flexbox this is another thing pulled over

- [01:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=5463) this is another thing pulled over grits and this is a hard example to

- [01:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=5467) grits and this is a hard example to understand maybe there's another thing

- [01:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=5476) okay inline block and you can look for that

- [01:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=5479) inline block and you can look for that if you want

- [01:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=5480) if you want i will just move there is flex

- [01:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=5483) i will just move there is flex um this is the new feature of browsers

- [01:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=5487) um this is the new feature of browsers but this is awesome feature by the way

- [01:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=5492) but this is awesome feature by the way and you can also use flexbox

- [01:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=5505) you may need to read more about flex if you want to learn

- [01:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=5507) you want to learn i will just pass it for now uh

- [01:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=5510) i will just pass it for now uh float is just float

- [01:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=5533) let's test it okay anyway there is nothing you need

- [01:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=5535) okay anyway there is nothing you need lord take position

- [01:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=5537) lord take position according to the other elements there is

- [01:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=5541) according to the other elements there is interactions let's see if there is

- [01:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=5543) interactions let's see if there is anything interesting

- [01:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=5545) anything interesting wow nice so select all select auto

- [01:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=5548) wow nice so select all select auto like this when i double click it select

- [01:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=5555) and let's select on i hit select none by the way

- [01:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=5557) the way so the interactions

- [01:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=5570) pointer event so this is this cannot be clicked

- [01:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=5571) clicked so it is pa none this can be default

- [01:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=5574) so it is pa none this can be default behavior

- [01:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=5577) behavior [Music]

- [01:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=5584) okay this is not a really important thing

- [01:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=5585) thing but it's just awesome and it's

- [01:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=5594) overflow overflow is just about this you see there is a scroll bar

- [01:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=5596) see there is a scroll bar you can set overflow hidden if all flow

- [01:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=5598) you can set overflow hidden if all flow hidden it won't be visible

- [01:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=5600) hidden it won't be visible if overflow visible it will overflow as

- [01:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=5603) if overflow visible it will overflow as name suggests and if you set overflow

- [01:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=5605) name suggests and if you set overflow auto it will overflow

- [01:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=5607) auto it will overflow from both sizes

- [01:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=5616) instead of style overflow you just use overflow class

- [01:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=5617) overflow class that's all about it

- [01:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=5621) that's all about it and then there is position so position

- [01:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=5624) and then there is position so position static relative absolute fixed and

- [01:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=5630) steady what is pollution study i i don't

- [01:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=5633) what is pollution study i i don't know it is the same

- [01:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=5636) know it is the same as absolute

- [01:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=5643) anyway so you can have position relative like this it is displayed at the top

- [01:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=5647) like this it is displayed at the top i mean the position right it's it's part

- [01:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=5650) i mean the position right it's it's part element and position

- [01:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=5652) element and position top is you'll see displaying here okay

- [01:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=5658) top is you'll see displaying here okay and [Music]

- [01:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=5662) [Music] we can have other examples as well this

- [01:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=5664) we can have other examples as well this is a good example actually let's put it

- [01:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=5671) so you see for this to work the parent element

- [01:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=5673) element may need to have a position absolute

- [01:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=5675) may need to have a position absolute relative

- [01:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=5676) relative i think that's

- [01:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=5683) i'm tested so i will remove position relative for

- [01:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=5685) relative for modern copy pasting

- [01:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=5700) yeah so these are the first ones and these are the second ones

- [01:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=5703) and these are the second ones i can see them so we need to add them

- [01:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=5706) i can see them so we need to add them into

- [01:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=5707) into inside the containers

- [01:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=5715) but when you remove hard position relative

- [01:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=5715) relative it gets broken

- [01:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=5725) yeah so i need to so they must have

- [01:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=5728) to so they must have position relative as a parent

- [01:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=5756) and you see position after top zero starts

- [01:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=5758) you see position after top zero starts to the translation middle button

- [01:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=5761) to the translation middle button on the prime around the pin wow it looks

- [01:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=5763) on the prime around the pin wow it looks cool

- [01:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=5765) cool style bits rm hrm

- [01:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=5769) style bits rm hrm so this is actually a division here

- [01:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=5784) so it's the position right here and you see between one and two there is

- [01:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=5785) see between one and two there is actually a div

- [01:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=5787) actually a div so this is the bottom this is the button

- [01:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=5789) so this is the bottom this is the button and between them

- [01:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=5798) oh i see so this is the button and this is another one where does that

- [01:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=5802) and this is another one where does that come oh this is progress bar i see

- [01:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=5809) so this progress bar is what is being displayed here

- [01:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=5817) and since we use position absolute top here they are getting

- [01:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=5819) here they are getting all they are getting these positions

- [01:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=5823) all they are getting these positions oh cool okay

- [01:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=5831) there is shadows right here box shadow

- [01:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=5850) and sizing you relate to the department you should hate auto

- [01:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=5854) you should hate auto okay let's add this

- [01:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=5905) oh it's taking a lot of space anyway let's continue with spacing

- [01:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=5910) anyway let's continue with spacing so spacing is all about merging and

- [01:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=5912) so spacing is all about merging and padding

- [01:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=5913) padding uh they their notation is like this

- [01:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=5918) uh they their notation is like this negative merging up

- [01:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=5921) negative merging up so you can also gap like this

- [01:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=5930) yeah you already know that i think

- [01:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=5940) margin link yeah okay

- [01:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=5946) there is text text alignment we already know text alignment you see you can

- [01:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=5948) know text alignment you see you can center right align left align

- [01:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=5951) center right align left align text wrapping words page

- [01:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=5956) text wrapping words page so you can also have a wordplay like

- [01:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=5958) so you can also have a wordplay like this

- [01:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=5959) this uh for wordpress we add text break here

- [01:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=5962) uh for wordpress we add text break here otherwise it won't get broken

- [01:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=5964) otherwise it won't get broken into the multiple lines let's test it

- [01:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=5967) into the multiple lines let's test it out

- [01:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=5968) out so text wrapping versus text break

- [01:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=5978) okay so the text break breaks into the next line but text wrapping

- [01:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=5980) next line but text wrapping is expanding our you see maximum width

- [01:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=5990) that is text transform font size oh font size

- [01:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=5990) size like this fs1 fs4 point wait for

- [01:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=6007) okay fw front page fct italics or fct is fond style probably yeah

- [01:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=6011) fond style probably yeah yeah phone style is fct

- [01:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=6014) yeah phone style is fct so let's note this

- [01:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=6022) text uh text alignment

- [01:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=6037) world page text transform

- [01:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=6051) by the italics and you can have line height well it

- [01:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=6054) and you can have line height well it even supports line height

- [01:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=6056) even supports line height like in work this is cool

- [01:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=6065) i think how does it do that probably padding for that mushroom

- [01:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=6069) probably padding for that mushroom let's refresh you see line heading

- [01:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=6073) let's refresh you see line heading it is really cool you can have mono

- [01:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=6076) it is really cool you can have mono space so each character is taking

- [01:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=6079) space so each character is taking same uh

- [01:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=6102) won't be diatonics okay we have right everything that

- [01:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=6104) everything that presses colors

- [01:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=6111) so when you use reset color it is using the parent text which is for example in

- [01:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=6113) the parent text which is for example in text method

- [01:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=6115) text method text calculation okay that's it that's

- [01:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=6118) text calculation okay that's it that's all

- [01:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=6132) [Music] as needed vertical align is hard

- [01:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=6136) as needed vertical align is hard believe me to achieve when you are not

- [01:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=6139) believe me to achieve when you are not using table

- [01:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=6141) using table or here they have user table as well

- [01:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=6149) or here they have user table as well okay

- [01:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=6168) okay so there is this difference bit field

- [01:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=6169) field between visibility and display

- [01:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=6176) between visibility and display one of them takes space the other one is

- [01:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=6177) one of them takes space the other one is not class visible invisible

- [01:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=6186) and display none and yeah so let's see the difference

- [01:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=6196) okay so and let me show so when it is visible it takes space

- [01:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=6198) so when it is visible it takes space when it is invisible it is taking space

- [01:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=6200) when it is invisible it is taking space when it is displayed on it is not taking

- [01:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=6202) when it is displayed on it is not taking space okay

- [01:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=6205) space okay display none takes no space

- [01:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=6208) display none takes no space in browser flow

- [01:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=6212) in browser flow average visibility

- [01:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=6216) average visibility invisible takes space but

- [01:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=6219) invisible takes space but not visible so this is the difference

- [01:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=6233) and then there is extent okay that's not our topic right now

- [01:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=6244) so for icons i think we need to add external

- [01:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=6246) external thing

- [01:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=6251) yeah both drop icons we have already added that as

- [01:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=6252) added that as in previous lectures okay that's

- [01:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=6255) in previous lectures okay that's all about bootstrap five

- [01:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=6259) all about bootstrap five now i can show an example of

- [01:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=6263) now i can show an example of custom login okay

- [01:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=6272) okay uh how you design your login and other things

- [01:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=6273) other things is totally up to you

- [01:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=6276) is totally up to you but let's add a new here as login

- [01:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=6288) but let's add a new here as login in this login what we are going to do is

- [01:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=6290) in this login what we are going to do is we are going to send

- [01:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=6292) we are going to send a database to the server

- [01:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=6296) a database to the server and then log in the user that's it

- [01:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=6302) and then log in the user that's it so let's open

- [01:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=6305) so let's open our

- [01:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=6313) sql server management studio by the way in my own project i

- [01:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=6318) by the way in my own project i keep the login information in the

- [01:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=6320) keep the login information in the session data

- [01:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=6322) session data so if user is logged in

- [01:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=6326) so if user is logged in i put it inside the session

- [01:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=6330) i put it inside the session and if not i check session whether

- [01:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=6333) and if not i check session whether user login or not it is totally up to

- [01:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=6336) user login or not it is totally up to you how you

- [01:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=6342) design your session we have shown you can even keep

- [01:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=6355) like this session set card you can set string

- [01:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=6359) you can set string as well

- [01:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=6372) as well okay in our mvc database

- [01:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=6376) okay in our mvc database we have users and in users

- [01:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=6381) we have users and in users we have

- [01:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=6390) okay first thing we are birthday and whatever we want

- [01:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=6392) whatever we want so um

- [01:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=6393) so um [Music]

- [01:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=6412) logi so this will be

- [01:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=6415) be wrote

- [01:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=6437) what we are going to do is we are going to set

- [01:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=6442) to set [Music]

- [01:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=6449) yeah this is the way we are going to set we are going to set if user entered

- [01:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=6451) we are going to set if user entered correct

- [01:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=6452) correct pass force and username

- [01:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=6455) pass force and username we already have made examples of forms

- [01:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=6461) we already have made examples of forms for example

- [01:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=6461) for example [Music]

- [01:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=6465) [Music] from lecture 13 yeah let's use this post

- [01:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=6476) [Music] here so we can set a speed route

- [01:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=6479) here so we can set a speed route for post let's set a route in our

- [01:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=6482) for post let's set a route in our controller

- [01:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=6484) controller okay here

- [01:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=6487) okay here so for this we are going to set a name

- [01:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=6495) as equal to login rot you can give any name you want

- [01:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=6498) rot you can give any name you want so it will be posted here and

- [01:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=6502) so it will be posted here and we also i i need to change

- [01:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=6507) we also i i need to change actually here

- [01:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=6513) we also need to have a model to verify post information so

- [01:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=6517) post information so let's have

- [01:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=6520) let's have a model here i am going to have login

- [01:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=6524) a model here i am going to have login model

- [01:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=6538) so inside here we are going to have two property raw

- [01:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=6540) property raw prop sr

- [01:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=6543) prop sr username current large system doesn't

- [01:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=6547) username current large system doesn't have password so i will

- [01:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=6549) have password so i will use a user first name and email

- [01:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=6552) use a user first name and email for verification to lock a user

- [01:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=6556) for verification to lock a user so as our first name

- [01:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=6560) so as our first name and then you are going to have

- [01:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=6563) and then you are going to have by the way i explain a very detailed

- [01:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=6566) by the way i explain a very detailed login system in my

- [01:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=6568) login system in my other lectures for example in advanced

- [01:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=6571) other lectures for example in advanced programming lecture in object oriented

- [01:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=6573) programming lecture in object oriented programming lecture

- [01:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=6574) programming lecture so if you want to learn how to make a

- [01:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=6577) so if you want to learn how to make a login system

- [01:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=6578) login system you should watch them it is basically

- [01:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=6580) you should watch them it is basically same because uh

- [01:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=6584) same because uh our mvc project also uses c-sharp and my

- [01:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=6587) our mvc project also uses c-sharp and my lectures also use c-sharp

- [01:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=6591) lectures also use c-sharp so if you watch my

- [01:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=6596) so if you watch my let me show introduction programming

- [01:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=6600) let me show introduction programming or advanced programming here

- [01:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=6603) or advanced programming here you will learn about how to make a

- [01:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=6606) you will learn about how to make a proper login system with

- [01:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=6609) proper login system with salted keywords salted and hashed

- [01:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=6611) salted keywords salted and hashed keywords

- [01:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=6612) keywords to have maximum security how to record

- [01:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=6616) to have maximum security how to record them in database

- [01:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=6617) them in database how to uh

- [01:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=6624) let's say save username password give them id login users

- [01:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=6628) give them id login users and such everything related login

- [01:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=6630) and such everything related login operations

- [01:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=6631) operations background code is explained in

- [01:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=6634) background code is explained in introduction to programming and

- [01:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=6635) introduction to programming and advanced programming if you already know

- [01:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=6637) advanced programming if you already know c-sharp which you should already have

- [01:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=6640) c-sharp which you should already have you can watch my advanced programming

- [01:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=6642) you can watch my advanced programming course

- [01:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=6644) course videos and then you will learn

- [01:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=6646) videos and then you will learn everything

- [01:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=6647) everything related to proper login system okay so

- [01:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=6650) related to proper login system okay so i am just showing a quick example on

- [01:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=6653) i am just showing a quick example on this uh

- [01:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=6654) this uh lecture right now since it was requested

- [01:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=6657) lecture right now since it was requested uh so email

- [01:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=6664) and let's add that as a model here model uh it will be from

- [01:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=6668) a model here model uh it will be from nature9 model start

- [01:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=6670) nature9 model start login okay so asp4 will be

- [01:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=6674) login okay so asp4 will be for let's see autocomplete

- [01:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=6683) okay uh as our first name and this will be by the way card

- [01:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=6687) and this will be by the way card so we can also display

- [01:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=6692) so we can also display our display it was like

- [01:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=6696) our display it was like let me find

- [01:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=6716) by the way uh in our previous lectures we have truly

- [01:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=6718) we have truly seen everything related to this so i'm

- [01:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=6721) seen everything related to this so i'm not going to

- [01:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=6721) not going to waste time with them

- [01:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=6734) okay and in our is our login index

- [01:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=6739) our is our login index here um please under please enter your

- [01:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=6742) here um please under please enter your first name

- [01:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=6753) okay and then we are going to have same for okay

- [01:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=6757) same for okay let's go to complete email

- [01:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=6771) some database solid model okay that's it and in our

- [01:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=6775) and in our lecture cell controller we are going to

- [01:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=6777) lecture cell controller we are going to get

- [01:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=6780) get the model start login i

- [01:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=6784) the model start login i login

- [01:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=6791) and i can verify it if i want but for now i won't so here we need to

- [01:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=6794) but for now i won't so here we need to use

- [01:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=6794) use our database

- [01:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=6801) so let's check database example in our lectures copy paste

- [01:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=6830) can we see context and we have tbr users and i need to use

- [01:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=6834) and i need to use wash here dot okay here that

- [01:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=6839) wash here dot okay here that email equal to login dot

- [01:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=6849) sr email and and here that first name equal to

- [01:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=6854) here that first name equal to my login.first name

- [01:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=6871) strength and hint this is oh we have a problem with here

- [01:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=6875) we have a problem with here oh this is my mistake okay let me fix

- [01:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=6880) oh this is my mistake okay let me fix okay um and let's have first or default

- [01:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=6885) okay um and let's have first or default so the default value of

- [01:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=6894) i think default is sources empty otherwise first elements of default t

- [01:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=6896) otherwise first elements of default t source if source is empty

- [01:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=6898) source if source is empty so the default will be node probably i

- [01:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=6902) so the default will be node probably i think

- [01:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=6921) environment passwords i mean email it first name and email combination

- [01:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=6924) first name and email combination and of course you can display much

- [01:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=6926) and of course you can display much better

- [01:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=6928) better things otherwise

- [01:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=6931) things otherwise it is not nude finally we are using

- [01:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=6935) it is not nude finally we are using info

- [01:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=6942) we can have a custom class or we can just

- [01:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=6943) just voltage inside a user session

- [01:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=6947) voltage inside a user session such as an example was somewhere around

- [01:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=6950) such as an example was somewhere around here

- [01:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=6958) you see as you write code you will memorize it but under memorizing

- [01:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=6962) memorize it but under memorizing um there is this serialize and we must

- [01:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=6964) um there is this serialize and we must have a center serialize

- [01:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=6967) have a center serialize you can just copy paste your older code

- [01:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=6971) you can just copy paste your older code okay and user login

- [01:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=6977) and to be able to use it i need to add a reference of course

- [01:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=6986) and as a user login i am going to use serialization what is it is

- [01:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=6990) serialization what is it is here i will use json converse serialize

- [01:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=6993) here i will use json converse serialize and i will just use so this is tbr users

- [01:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=6997) and i will just use so this is tbr users type

- [01:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=6998) type this uh i need some okay

- [01:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=7003) this uh i need some okay and i will set session and then

- [01:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=7006) and i will set session and then um it is going to return here

- [01:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=7011) um it is going to return here so you see um

- [01:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=7017) if i want to check whether user is logged in or

- [01:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=7018) logged in or not i need to do it like this

- [01:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=7021) not i need to do it like this [Music]

- [01:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=7022) [Music] if

- [01:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=7040) okay we can check if user has user login or not

- [01:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=7045) or not and then

- [01:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=7050) let's see [Music]

- [01:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=7059) we can deserialize it and tell that user is logged in

- [01:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=7061) is logged in so in my model i'm going to add some

- [01:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=7064) so in my model i'm going to add some extra attribute display

- [01:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=7072) here let's add prop sync

- [01:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=7080) okay is users notebooks unless this have a tbr

- [01:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=7084) this have a tbr tbr users

- [01:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=7091) users okay values so by default i will set it as a node

- [01:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=7095) so by default i will set it as a node actually it could be by default no since

- [01:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=7096) actually it could be by default no since it's an object type

- [01:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=7099) it's an object type and if user is logged in

- [01:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=7102) and if user is logged in i will deserialize it

- [01:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=7106) i will deserialize it like here

- [01:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=7117) okay of course to be able to have that i need to

- [01:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=7118) need to log in okay um users

- [01:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=7121) log in okay um users login of course to be able to use login

- [01:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=7126) login of course to be able to use login i need that using

- [01:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=7142) and user login.tv actual user values fill the e code so

- [01:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=7146) actual user values fill the e code so json convert this object login

- [01:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=7150) json convert this object login and session

- [01:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=7156) and session gets string

- [01:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=7160) gets string so we get string it get the key like

- [01:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=7163) so we get string it get the key like this

- [01:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=7165) this and then i would return okay here

- [01:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=7169) and then i would return okay here login and

- [01:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=7177) since our name is logincshtml as an object yes yeah

- [01:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=7180) as an object yes yeah [Music]

- [01:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=7182) [Music] oh by the way this is returning the

- [01:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=7185) oh by the way this is returning the default index not the login index

- [01:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=7194) so let's break it here these are nice objects so

- [01:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=7195) objects so where is the problem here

- [02:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=7206) oh login.tv or each of these will be table users type

- [02:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=7207) table users type i like this okay

- [02:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=7211) i like this okay so in our index

- [02:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=7214) so in our index actually let's uh return

- [02:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=7223) um what i'm going to do is let's reverse back

- [02:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=7231) like this return weave and i will have another index as index 2

- [02:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=7233) and i will have another index as index 2 and this will have a

- [02:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=7235) and this will have a custom rod as

- [02:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=7251) and this will login okay so let's revolve this

- [02:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=7252) revolve this road and simply

- [02:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=7256) road and simply we will return login view yeah

- [02:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=7259) we will return login view yeah okay and if user is logged in we will

- [02:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=7262) okay and if user is logged in we will display it

- [02:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=7263) display it as like this okay

- [02:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=7267) as like this okay so if

- [02:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=7275) a model that tbl actually if model is not equal to node

- [02:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=7278) actually if model is not equal to node but of course it wouldn't work user was

- [02:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=7281) but of course it wouldn't work user was equal not equal to

- [02:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=7282) equal not equal to node let's say uh

- [02:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=7286) node let's say uh logos in users okay to type it of course

- [02:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=7290) logos in users okay to type it of course we need to have it

- [02:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=7291) we need to have it something like this okay logged in user

- [02:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=7295) something like this okay logged in user id it will

- [02:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=7295) id it will be that model that

- [02:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=7299) be that model that okay user values that

- [02:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=7302) okay user values that okay user id

- [02:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=7305) okay user id and logged in users

- [02:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=7310) and logged in users first name okay

- [02:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=7334) and then you can also show this email whatever you want you see it is all up

- [02:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=7336) whatever you want you see it is all up to your imagination how

- [02:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=7337) to your imagination how you design is of your design login users

- [02:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=7349) i'm just simply telling you the idea when you log out you just destroy that

- [02:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=7351) when you log out you just destroy that session value and

- [02:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=7352) session value and tada it is logged out

- [02:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=7366) else okay i think let's make it like this

- [02:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=7370) okay i think let's make it like this uh no user is no but in yet

- [02:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=7379) and let's also add a form to log out

- [02:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=7383) a form to log out okay so for log out

- [02:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=7387) okay so for log out it will be simply pretty simple actually

- [02:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=7395) by the way uh we will return [Music]

- [02:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=7404) we login actually we need to redirect login not return via login so how we

- [02:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=7406) login not return via login so how we were redirecting

- [02:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=7422) so that our logged in data can be okay redirect action yeah let's do that

- [02:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=7435) redirect action index 2 okay and let's also have a logout

- [02:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=7446) as oak out look at you road

- [02:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=7450) look at you road go out by the way this doesn't need any

- [02:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=7455) go out by the way this doesn't need any model so it will simply

- [02:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=7459) model so it will simply sessions and how do we remove

- [02:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=7465) sessions and how do we remove remove yeah that's it

- [02:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=7470) remove yeah that's it user login

- [02:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=7476) and redirect action yeah index 2

- [02:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=7480) yeah index 2 and in our index page

- [02:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=7483) and in our index page our login page i mean yes

- [02:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=7487) our login page i mean yes we just need to type okay logout

- [02:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=7493) we just need to type okay logout users okay let's test it

- [02:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=7544) okay no user is logged in first name let's type something as

- [02:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=7546) let's type something as as incorrect okay involved first name

- [02:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=7548) as incorrect okay involved first name and email combination

- [02:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=7550) and email combination let's type something valid as first name

- [02:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=7552) let's type something valid as first name totals

- [02:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=7554) totals email is this

- [02:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=7560) okay login user id first name talos university and that's

- [02:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=7562) university and that's a refresh page we are still logged in

- [02:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=7565) a refresh page we are still logged in because we are keeping that data in

- [02:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=7568) because we are keeping that data in uh session on the session is destroyed

- [02:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=7570) uh session on the session is destroyed it will be there

- [02:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=7575) let's log out users and log out tada it's a custom authentication system

- [02:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=7578) it's a custom authentication system how you design is totally up to you you

- [02:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=7580) how you design is totally up to you you can improve it you can do whatever you

- [02:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=7582) can improve it you can do whatever you want

- [02:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=7582) want and end of the course

- [02:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=7587) and end of the course actually this course should spawn into

- [02:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=7590) actually this course should spawn into two semesters as i

- [02:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=7592) two semesters as i mention it because that can we can we

- [02:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=7595) mention it because that can we can we could show

- [02:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=7596) could show much more thing but as i said you if you

- [02:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=7599) much more thing but as i said you if you watch my introduction to the

- [02:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=7601) watch my introduction to the programming and advanced programming and

- [02:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=7603) programming and advanced programming and object-oriented programming

- [02:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=7605) object-oriented programming course videos here advanced programming

- [02:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=7612) introduction to programming and object-oriented programming if you watch

- [02:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=7614) object-oriented programming if you watch all these students series

- [02:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=7617) all these students series to the lecture one of internet you will

- [02:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=7620) to the lecture one of internet you will have much better

- [02:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=7621) have much better idea of how to code your

- [02:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=7624) idea of how to code your website at the server side and you

- [02:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=7627) website at the server side and you already

- [02:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=7627) already learned the basics actually fundamentals

- [02:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=7630) learned the basics actually fundamentals and even advanced topics of

- [02:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=7632) and even advanced topics of nbc design without net course

- [02:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=7636) nbc design without net course okay uh how to design a custom

- [02:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=7645) authentication and login system with using

- [02:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=7649) system with using session set string

- [02:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=7654) session set string get string and

- [02:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIsy8S_UO8k&t=7657) get string and sterilize these very nice
