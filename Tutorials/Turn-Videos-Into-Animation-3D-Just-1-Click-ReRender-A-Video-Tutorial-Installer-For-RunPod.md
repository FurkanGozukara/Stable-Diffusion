### Video Transcription


- [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cVf9Qf_pKks&t=0) Greetings everyone. In this video I am going to&nbsp; show you how to use ReRender A Video and new open&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cVf9Qf_pKks&t=8) source repository to generate amazing animation&nbsp; videos, 3d videos by using existing real videos.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cVf9Qf_pKks&t=16) If you don't know what is it let me show you. For&nbsp; example I have converted this Larry Wheels clip&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cVf9Qf_pKks&t=23) into this animation clip with just one click.&nbsp; So I will show you how to turn your real videos&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cVf9Qf_pKks&t=31) into animation or 3d on RunPod with one click&nbsp; installer. All you need to do is download this&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cVf9Qf_pKks&t=37) installer.sh file open your RunPod from this link.&nbsp; If you don't have a RunPod sign up or login. If&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cVf9Qf_pKks&t=44) you have let's login. Then go to community cloud,&nbsp; select extreme speed from here. You can use higher&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cVf9Qf_pKks&t=52) VRAM having machines with higher batch size.&nbsp; However, for this tutorial I will use RTX 3090&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cVf9Qf_pKks&t=60) which is one of my best GPU selection. From here&nbsp; type fast and select RunPod Fast Stable Diffusion&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cVf9Qf_pKks&t=67) template. Click continue. Deploy. Go to my pods&nbsp; wait until connect button appears here. Okay&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cVf9Qf_pKks&t=75) connect button appeared, click connect. Connect&nbsp; to the Jupyterlab. Once the interface has opened&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cVf9Qf_pKks&t=80) click this icon, upload the installer.sh file&nbsp; then all you need to do is start a new terminal&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cVf9Qf_pKks&t=87) by clicking here and use these two commands. So I&nbsp; copy them, copy paste them and hit enter. And it&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cVf9Qf_pKks&t=96) will start the fully automatic installation for&nbsp; you. It will also download the necessary model&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cVf9Qf_pKks&t=102) files automatically for you. So the necessary&nbsp; libraries installation have been completed.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cVf9Qf_pKks&t=107) Now it is downloading the models automatically&nbsp; for you into the correct folders. All right,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cVf9Qf_pKks&t=113) all of the models are also downloaded. Now we&nbsp; are ready to launch the web UI. To do that,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cVf9Qf_pKks&t=119) we will use this part of the script. So let's open&nbsp; a new terminal here. Copy paste everything. And&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cVf9Qf_pKks&t=127) let's say if you want to use additional models,&nbsp; what you need to do is: you need to download&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cVf9Qf_pKks&t=134) them inside models folder. And you need to modify&nbsp; sd_model_cfg.py file and add them here. As you are&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cVf9Qf_pKks&t=143) seeing right now. Moreover, I suggest you to edit&nbsp; this video_blend.py file and make OPEN_EBSYNTH_LOG&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cVf9Qf_pKks&t=153) True. This is super important because with&nbsp; this you will have much more verbose output&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cVf9Qf_pKks&t=160) in the workspace where you have launched. Now it&nbsp; has started, we will use Gradio Live interface.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cVf9Qf_pKks&t=167) Currently, we are not able to upload our video&nbsp; into workspace and give its path. I have opened&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cVf9Qf_pKks&t=174) an issue thread for this. So we are going to use&nbsp; upload from here. Let's select our video. So let's&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cVf9Qf_pKks&t=181) go to video file location. I will use this video.&nbsp; Where was it? Here. So this is the video. First of&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cVf9Qf_pKks&t=190) all, you need to define your scene very carefully.&nbsp; If your scene has multiple different scenarios,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cVf9Qf_pKks&t=199) then you should split them because your prompt&nbsp; should be able to define your scene as much&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cVf9Qf_pKks&t=204) as possible. In this scene, a bodybuilder is&nbsp; posing in a gym, so a muscular man is posing&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cVf9Qf_pKks&t=213) in a gym. Then there are several settings. Default&nbsp; settings are really good. But if your video is HD,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cVf9Qf_pKks&t=221) I suggest you to make this 704. Then I suggest&nbsp; you to change this to Canny. Make Canny low&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cVf9Qf_pKks&t=228) threshold 25, high threshold 50. Moreover,&nbsp; your base model will have huge effect. So you,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cVf9Qf_pKks&t=235) I suggest you to use Flat_2D_Animerge, you&nbsp; can also try different models. This is an&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cVf9Qf_pKks&t=241) anime model. And most importantly, according to&nbsp; your resolution, you need to reduce this number&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cVf9Qf_pKks&t=247) of parallel processes. For 24 gigabyte and this&nbsp; resolution 2 is the maximum that you should set.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cVf9Qf_pKks&t=255) If you go higher resolution, make this 1, if you&nbsp; go lower resolution, and according to your VRAM,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cVf9Qf_pKks&t=260) you can increase this. This will significantly&nbsp; affect your processing time. So it is super&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cVf9Qf_pKks&t=266) important. And before clicking run all, make sure&nbsp; that your first keyframe is what you are looking&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cVf9Qf_pKks&t=273) for. When you first time hit the first keyframe,&nbsp; it will load all of the models as you are seeing&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cVf9Qf_pKks&t=279) right now. We are able to watch everything in this&nbsp; started terminal. The first time will be slower,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cVf9Qf_pKks&t=285) but second and third and more will be faster.&nbsp; Because it will cache it in the memory. By the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cVf9Qf_pKks&t=292) way, since this is running on a remote server, it&nbsp; will upload file to the remote server. And if your&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cVf9Qf_pKks&t=299) file is too big, it will take a lot of time. Once&nbsp; your file is uploaded, these options will become&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cVf9Qf_pKks&t=305) available. The number of key frames. I have&nbsp; tested different key frames, and 10 is really,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cVf9Qf_pKks&t=310) really optimal. So you will see a loading icon&nbsp; here. I will also demonstrate it. Okay, we got the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cVf9Qf_pKks&t=316) first key as you are seeing right now. For example&nbsp; we can also try with another model. Let's try with&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cVf9Qf_pKks&t=323) RevAnimated. It is also downloaded and let's&nbsp; say a muscular man is posing in a gym 3d CGI,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cVf9Qf_pKks&t=330) okay, character. Let's see the first key frame&nbsp; output for this. So it will reload the different&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cVf9Qf_pKks&t=337) model. And we got the output. It is really really&nbsp; looking like a 3d CGI character as you are seeing&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cVf9Qf_pKks&t=345) right now. Actually it is amazing. It is even&nbsp; better looking than the other one. Let me show&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cVf9Qf_pKks&t=351) you what I mean by uploading, uploading process.&nbsp; For example I have another file. Let's see, here:&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cVf9Qf_pKks&t=359) this is three megabytes and this is 12 megabytes.&nbsp; Okay, I selected it. And after I selected it you&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cVf9Qf_pKks&t=366) see this part of the web UI became like this.&nbsp; It is loading. So this means that it is actually&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cVf9Qf_pKks&t=373) uploading. You need to wait here become available.&nbsp; Once it becomes available It means that the file&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cVf9Qf_pKks&t=380) is uploaded. I can also see the upload process&nbsp; here. And it is uploaded. Very nice. So it was&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cVf9Qf_pKks&t=386) fast. Now I can click run first keyframe and it&nbsp; will make this a first keyframe. Let's see also&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cVf9Qf_pKks&t=393) that one. And we got the first keyframe so we can&nbsp; run all and process it all. So it is also looking&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cVf9Qf_pKks&t=399) like a CGI character. And let's return back to&nbsp; our previous one. And now it will re-upload.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cVf9Qf_pKks&t=407) Every time it re-uploads unfortunately. I opened&nbsp; an issue for this. Maybe it will get fixed in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cVf9Qf_pKks&t=413) future versions. So where will be the output&nbsp; file? The output video will be here once it&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cVf9Qf_pKks&t=419) is completed. But let's say the Gradio app lost&nbsp; its connection. So you will find the file inside&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cVf9Qf_pKks&t=426) render a video folder. Inside results: you will&nbsp; see the file name, the video file name having&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cVf9Qf_pKks&t=433) folder here. So it will be inside there. For&nbsp; example, the for the posing video, we will have&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cVf9Qf_pKks&t=439) a blend.mp4 file here. Okay, let's see, the&nbsp; file is uploaded. Let's click first keyframe.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cVf9Qf_pKks&t=450) Okay. Now I am ready to process all. Before doing&nbsp; that I will make sure that the number of parallel&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cVf9Qf_pKks&t=456) processes are 2 and run all. And that's it. Now&nbsp; I need to wait it to process all of the keyframes&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cVf9Qf_pKks&t=464) and everything and the result will be inside this&nbsp; folder. We can also see the keyframes here in a&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cVf9Qf_pKks&t=470) moment. Now it generated the 11th frame. Yes. Now&nbsp; we can see it. Okay, it started generating the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cVf9Qf_pKks&t=478) keys. So it is working. And as I said, the final&nbsp; video will be here. Then we can download. I also&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cVf9Qf_pKks&t=485) have added how to merge the output video with&nbsp; its sound. Unfortunately, it is not keeping the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cVf9Qf_pKks&t=492) sound. Moreover, if your video FPS is like this,&nbsp; you may want to convert it to closest FPS with&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cVf9Qf_pKks&t=501) FFMPEG. Thank you very much for supporting me on&nbsp; Patreon. Hopefully I will make a public tutorial,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cVf9Qf_pKks&t=506) step-by-step tutorial for my non-Patreon&nbsp; supporter subscribers as well. See you later.
