### Video Transcription


- [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=0) Greetings everyone. As you know, Stable Diffusion 3.5 has been released. So, I have prepared this

- [00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=7) amazing tutorial for you with a lot of information. I have compared all the schedulers and

- [00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=13) samplers for Stable Diffusion 3.5 Large model. Everything you see on this tutorial is publicly

- [00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=21) shared, nothing paywalled. So, this is totally open access tutorial. Not only that, I have

- [00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=27) compared FLUX DEV versus Stable Diffusion 3.5 Large comprehensively. Shared grids analyzed them,

- [00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=36) so you will see which one is performing better. Moreover, I have compared the FP8 versus FP16

- [00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=45) version of the Stable Diffusion 3.5 Large, and you will not believe the results. The grids and

- [00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=53) everything is shared. Furthermore, there is a newer version of T5XXL

- [00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=57) Text Encoder. I have compared it with the FP16 version, and you will like it.

- [00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=63) Moreover, there is a newer FLUX FP8 version. It's a scaled version by the ComfyUI org,

- [00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=71) and it is really really good. So, you will see the results of it as well. And that is not all. I will

- [00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=77) show you how to use Stable Diffusion 3.5 and FLUX with the very best configuration on the SwarmUI.

- [00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=86) The SwarmUI is the most advanced and optimized UI to use the FLUX and Stable Diffusion 3.5 model.

- [00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=94) I will show how to install on the Windows and also on RunPod and Massed Compute.

- [00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=102) Everything will be shown. The all configurations and installation will be shown.

- [00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=107) So, this is the very best tutorial that you are going to find regarding the Stable Diffusion 3.5

- [00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=112) and the FLUX models. So, as usual, I have prepared an amazing article,

- [00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=117) that contains all the links and the instructions. This is an open access article, open source

- [00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=125) article. You don't need to have an account or register to see this article. You can view this

- [00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=131) article even in the private window. Let me demonstrate you. As an incognito window,

- [00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=137) you see the article is fully viewable and accessible. So, the link of this article

- [00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=141) will be in the description of the video. I will begin with installing the SwarmUI on my Windows

- [00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=147) computer. Show how to download and use the Stable Diffusion 3.5 Large version and FLUX DEV version

- [00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=155) with the newest developments and the best configuration. Then I will do the comparisons

- [00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=162) and evaluations that I have introduced in the beginning of the video. Then I will show on the

- [00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=168) RunPod and Massed Compute. So, go to the very bottom of the post where you will see the

- [00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=174) attachments. On Windows 10, you need to have

- [00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=177) installed .NET 8 SDK as instructed by the SwarmUI. On 11, it is fully automatic. So,

- [00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=184) if you get any error, install the .NET 8 SDK file from here. So, in the attachments,

- [00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=190) download the SwarmUI windows installer.bat file. Move into the disk where you want to install. I

- [00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=196) am going to install into my G drive. Make a folder like SwarmUI. Do not use any space

- [00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=201) character or anything. Double click and start. Do not run as administrator because it makes

- [00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=207) difference. Run anyway. Then the installation will automatically start. In this screen,

- [00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=212) click agree. I will use customized settings. I will select the modern dark. Next. Just yourself

- [00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=218) on this PC. Next. ComfyUI local. Next. I am not going to install anything. And I am sure install

- [00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=225) now. I will also show how to update your existing installation to use with Stable Diffusion 3.5 and

- [00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=231) the latest FLUX DEV model. Then follow your CMD window to see if there are any errors or

- [00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=237) not. And the SwarmUI has been installed successfully. On the CMD window, I only have

- [00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=243) this error which I can ignore because I am not writing API code. So, now how we are going to

- [00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=250) download the latest, very best models. I have prepared a repository that you can manually

- [00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=257) download. The link is here. When you go to this link, you will get to access all these different

- [00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=263) models that you can download into the accurate folders as written

- [00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=267) here, which I am going to show. However, I recommend you to use this automatic

- [00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=272) downloader file that I have prepared. It is working amazing. So, click here to go to there

- [00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=277) and click here to download it. Then paste it into the folder where your SwarmUI

- [00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=284) has been installed like this. Extract there with extract all like this. And move the files

- [00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=291) into the same folder like this. So, your SwarmUI folder and these files will be in the same

- [00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=297) folder. Then double click Windows download models.bat file. More info run anyway. Now,

- [00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=303) this screen is important. If you don't have more than 24 gigabytes of VRAM, I recommend you to use

- [00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=310) FP8 version of the FLUX Dev. And now we have scaled version which I will show you the comparison

- [00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=317) and it is working better than the FP8 raw version. This scaled version is very close

- [00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=323) to the FP16 version. So, I am going to download option 2.

- [00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=327) Then I am going to download FP8 scaled version of the Stable Diffusion 3.5 Large which works

- [00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=334) better than the FP16 version. This is amazing. You will be shocked by it. So, option 4.

- [00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=340) Then I am going to use FP8 T5 Scaled version. It is almost same quality and it will

- [00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=348) help me to save VRAM further which is option 6. Then we also have best Stable Diffusion SDXL and 1.5 models

- [00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=357) you can see the entire list here. However, I am not going to download them right now.

- [00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=362) And that's it. Then hit enter and it will automatically download everything. However,

- [00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=368) do not put a space character as I did. So, it is 2, 4, 6 and hit enter like this.

- [00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=373) And yes, it started downloading with the maximum possible speed. This script is

- [00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=379) fully optimized to download with the best possible speed. It is also robust and it has resume

- [00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=387) capability as well. So, you can restart the download and continue from wherever you have left.

- [00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=393) So, model downloads on my computer has been completed. All the files has been downloaded.

- [00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=398) Now, it is time to start using Stable Diffusion 3.5 and the FLUX latest version. So, how we gonna

- [00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=405) use it? Enter inside the SwarmUI folder. If you have already started SwarmUI, just close it.

- [00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=411) If you also have a previous installation of the SwarmUI, I recommend you to use update

- [00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=417) windows.bat file and make sure that update has no errors. Otherwise, it will not work.

- [00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=423) If there are errors, you can do a fresh installation then click launch windows.bat file

- [00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=428) and it will start the SwarmUI latest version after you have done all of this.

- [00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=433) Wait until backends are loading from the server. I will begin with showing the best configuration

- [00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=439) for the Stable Diffusion 3.5 Large version. Now, you may be wondering how did I come up with the

- [00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=446) best configuration.

- [00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=447) First of all, I have compared all the samplers and schedulers. You can see all of

- [00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=451) them by clicking this zip file, download it onto your computer and extract. When you extract it,

- [00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=457) you will see all the grids that I have shared. I have done testing 62 different prompts. Let

- [00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=462) me show you one of them. So, it is like this. It shows all the samplers and schedulers comparison.

- [00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=468) I have compared everything and decided which one is best. So, the best configurations are

- [00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=473) as like this. First of all, let's go to the models and select

- [00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=477) our Stable Diffusion 3.5 model, this one, scaled version. I prefer 40 steps and CFG scale 7,

- [00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=485) but you can also use different CFG scales. And then, display advanced options from here.

- [00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=490) In the sampling, go to the sampler and select DPM++ 2S Ancestral. This is working best and

- [00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=497) scheduler will be SGM Uniform. So, it is like this.

- [00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=501) You could also have noticed that this sampler is very slow. Even though this is the best sampler for

- [00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=507) Stable Diffusion 3.5, it is 2x slow compared to Euler + Beta. So, if you don't want to sacrifice

- [00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=517) speed, you can also use the Euler + Beta. This is the second best sampler configuration that I

- [00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=525) have found. Its speed is two times faster than the using DPM++ 2S Ancestral. So, its speed is

- [00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=535) directly 2x faster. It is up to your choice. Either use the very best sampler or use

- [00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=540) Euler + Beta. This is the second very best sampler. The choice is yours.

- [00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=546) Other than this, you don't need to select anything. This will work

- [00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=549) amazingly. So, let's try a prompt from the CivitAI like this. And copy paste it.

- [00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=555) Stable Diffusion 3.5 Large also supports negative prompts, but I am not going to do anything.

- [00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=561) Then, let's also open a nvitop and see our VRAM usage. It is using 3G

- [00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=567) currently and generate. To follow the progress, go to the server, logs, and debug. And follow

- [00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=574) what is happening here. This model that we downloaded includes the clip models,

- [00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=579) T5 models. So, it won't download anything else. And this is the VRAM usage. By the way,

- [00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=584) if your GPU has a lower VRAM, it will do all the optimizations. So, it should work

- [00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=589) as low as 6GB GPUs as well. To improve the speed on RTX 4000 series, you can edit here

- [00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=597) and add --fast and save. It should make the RTX 4000 series faster. So, let's go back to

- [00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=604) generate. And the image is getting generated right now. And the image has been generated.

- [00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=609) This is the image that we got. It's a decent image. This is how you use the Stable Diffusion 3.5

- [00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=615) Large version with the very best configuration currently.

- [00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=620) So, how you can also use LoRAs? It is so simple. Just find the SD 3.5 LoRAs from the SwarmUI

- [00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=627) for example. This is a LoRA. Download the LoRA file. Move it into your SwarmUI installation

- [00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=633) into models into the LoRA. Like this. Paste it there. Then, go back to your installation. Go

- [00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=639) to the LoRAs. Click refresh. And in here, select the LoRA. You see, you can decide the LoRA scale

- [00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=645) from here. Like this. And let's use the prompt shared here. So, this is a prompt. Okay, let's

- [00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=652) copy this. Paste it there. And the LoRA is selected with the scale 1. You can

- [00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=657) reduce the LoRA scale from here to reduce its impact. Then, generate. Now, it should use the

- [00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=663) both LoRA and the Stable Diffusion 3.5 Large model at the same time. Let's see if there will be any

- [00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=669) speed reduction. Both the speed and the VRAM usage looks same. As I said, if you have lower VRAM

- [00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=678) having GPU, it will use lower VRAM. It will do all the optimizations. But, however, since I have more

- [00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=685) VRAM, it is using whatever is available

- [00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=687) to speed up the generation further more. So, don't worry about your VRAM.

- [00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=691) It will work as low as 6 GB GPUs. Okay, the image has been completed. Let's look at it. And yes,

- [00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=697) it looks like working as expected. Now, how we gonna use the FLUX model with the latest

- [00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=704) configuration. For the FLUX model, let's go to the models and select the FLUX DEV scaled from

- [00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=709) here. For the FLUX, which sampler is the best? The best sampler is iPNDM. This one. And which

- [00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=717) scheduler is best? The best scheduler is DDIM Uniform. So, these are the best sampler and best

- [00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=723) scheduler. We are selecting the CFG scale as 1. Do not forget that. This is super important.

- [00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=730) I still prefer 40 steps. And I prefer the FLUX guidance scale 4.

- [00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=735) Now, what else there are to select? Go to the advanced model add-ons. And you can decide

- [00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=741) everything here. So, the clip large is like this. But since we have auto-downloaded it, it is ready.

- [00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=747) And for the T5, I am going to use this one. This is important. If you don't select this,

- [00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=752) it will download another one and use it. So, select this. And in the advanced sampling,

- [00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=758) you can make it automatic or you can make it like this as well. If this was FP16,

- [00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=764) I would use FP16. But I will let it automatic since this is FP8. And let's use the same prompt

- [00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=771) and see the difference. Generate. Now, we can watch the progress here. It is going to load the model.

- [00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=777) Unfortunately, you will see that it is downloading t5xxl_enconly model even though

- [00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=784) we didn't selected it. This is a mandatory thing that it does. So, you can ignore this. It is going

- [00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=790) to use the selected T5-XXL model. I have reported this, but this is how it is supposed to be.

- [00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=797) So, the FLUX model loaded and it is way faster than the Stable Diffusion 3.5 as you are seeing

- [00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=805) right now, surprisingly.

- [00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=807) And let's look at the memory

- [00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=808) usage. It is almost same. And the quality difference, we will see that in a moment.

- [00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=814) And the image has been generated. So, this is the FLUX FP8 scaled development model. And this is the

- [00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=822) Stable Diffusion 3.5 with the LoRA. Without LoRA, I don't expect to get better image. Let's also try

- [00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=829) same prompt as this one to see. The prompt was here. So, I will copy back again. And I will just paste it and

- [00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=837) generate another image. By the way, pay attention that I didn't select the LoRA of the Stable

- [00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=841) Diffusion 3.5. So, if you select incompatible LoRAs with the FLUX, it wouldn't work. Every

- [00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=848) model has their unique LoRAs. Like, Stable Diffusion XL has Stable Diffusion XL LoRAs,

- [00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=854) Stable Diffusion 1.5 has Stable Diffusion 1.5 LoRAs. So, every architecture requires a specific

- [00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=861) type of LoRA. They are not compatible with each other. And this is the FLUX dev model.

- [00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=867) I think they are both good. Not too bad. So, now it is time to do the comparisons. The grids are

- [00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=873) posted under the test results in the article shaded. They are fully public. You can download

- [00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=879) the FP8 comparisons of the T5 XXL. And you can download the FP8 comparison of the Diffusion Large.

- [00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=887) Actually there is a very little difference with the FP8 and FP16 T5 XXL. So I am going to pass it. But let me show you some comparisons of the

- [00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=897) FP8 and FP16 of Stable Diffusion Large 3.5. So open this link and click download.

- [00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=903) Open the downloaded grid file, it's a very big file as you are seeing right now, and

- [00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=908) when I analyzed it, thoroughly, I found that the FP8 version, the scaled FP8 version is following prompts better.

- [00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=918) For example, in this prompt, there is a photorealistic image of a man riding an enormous and terrifying

- [00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=926) Tyrannosaurus Rex in the prompt.

- [00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=928) So we expect a man to ride a Tyrannosaurus Rex, however, on the FP16 version, the man is here.

- [00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=937) But when I look at the FP8 version, a man is riding the Tyrannosaurus Rex.

- [00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=943) Yes, of course, it is not a great quality, this is Stable Diffusion 3.5, but FP8 is

- [00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=948) following the prompt better.

- [00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=949) Or in this prompt, I am expecting backdrop is a rich deep black, however, in the FP16 version.

- [00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=956) It is not black, but in the FP8 version, it is black. The background.

- [00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=960) And in another prompt, yet again, FP8 follows the prompt better.

- [00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=965) So look at this file, I believe FP8 version is better than the FP16 version. Somehow. But yes.

- [00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=972) And the biggest comparison is the FLUX vs Stable Diffusion 3.5. Let's open this link here and download it.

- [00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=980) This is a huge file. It is really huge. You will see it. So open it.

- [00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=985) Open it with a proper image editor and Paint .NET is a free open source editor.

- [00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=990) On the left, the images are FLUX DEV and on the right, the images are Stable Diffusion 3.5 Large.

- [00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=997) They are both compared in the 16-bit precision with the best T5XXL.

- [00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=1002) The FLUX is not very good with the Dragons, but still, it is way better looking than the

- [00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=1007) Stable Diffusion 3.5. You see, like this to like this. And FLUX is not again very good with the Dinosaurs.

- [00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=1015) This is Dinosaur image and this is another image. You see, this man is supposed to be riding this.

- [00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=1021) The Dinosaur is great, but it is not prompt following. And now, photo of a man.

- [00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=1026) You see, this is FLUX DEV model and this is the Stable Diffusion 3.5 model.

- [00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=1031) The FLUX DEV is way better. Here another photo. Again the FLUX DEV is way better. Here another photo.

- [00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=1039) Again the FLUX DEV is many times better as you are seeing right now. Here another photo.

- [00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=1045) In this photo, they are close. However, I think FLUX DEV is still better. Here another one.

- [00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=1050) We see that again the FLUX DEV is way better. Here another photo.

- [00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=1054) This is supposed to be the Witcher game engine 3D CGI render and yes, the FLUX DEV is amazing

- [00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=1061) and this is the Stable Diffusion 3.5. Look at this. And here another one.

- [00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=1065) This is World of Warcraft game 3D CGI render. You see, this is amazing FLUX DEV.

- [00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=1071) This is Stable Diffusion 3.5. In this prompt. The Stable Diffusion 3.5 is performed not bad.

- [00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=1078) Yes there are so many anatomical errors like this one, the face, but it is not very bad.

- [00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=1083) This is the FLUX DEV.

- [00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=1085) By the way, when you fine tune FLUX DEV with yourself it becomes way more realistic as

- [00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=1089) I have shown in my recent tutorial videos.

- [00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=1092) In this prompt this is FLUX DEV and this is the Stable Diffusion 3.5 not bad.

- [00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=1097) And in this prompt Stable Diffusion 3.5 not bad either. This is FLUX DEV.

- [00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=1102) Perhaps the Stable Diffusion 3.5 is better.

- [00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=1104) This is another prompt, again, the FLUX DEV is way more accurate, but this is also not very bad.

- [00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=1111) And here, this one, let's look at this one, a man, body armor, glowing with energy, sci-fi.

- [00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=1116) You see, this is way better looking than this one.

- [00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=1120) Or here, this one, again, the FLUX DEV is many times better than the Stable Diffusion

- [00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=1125) 3.5, again, the FLUX DEV way better.

- [00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=1128) Here in this one, a man, poster design for a theater production, dramatic eye-catching.

- [00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=1133) The FLUX DEV way better, again, in this one, you see, this is Stable Diffusion 3.5, I mean,

- [00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=1138) this is so bad, this is so bad compared to the FLUX DEV.

- [00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=1142) Or here, this one, in this image, I think they are both close, but still, FLUX DEV is way better.

- [00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=1148) In this one, I mean, look at this, this is the prompt, just pause the video and read

- [00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=1153) it, this is the image of FLUX DEV, and this is the image of the Stable Diffusion 3.5.

- [00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=1158) Or in this prompt. By the way, this image becomes way, way more realistic

- [00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=1163) when you do fine tuning, let me demonstrate you. So these images are from my recent FLUX fine tuning tutorial.

- [00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=1171) You can watch it. Let me show you a few of them.

- [00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=1173) You see the how much more it became realistic with fine-tuning as you are seeing right now.

- [00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=1179) This is my self-trained, this is amazing quality, and this is that image.

- [00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=1184) How much more realistic it became with doing fine-tuning as you are seeing right now.

- [00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=1189) Compare it to the raw model. This is raw model output.

- [00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=1192) And this is after I have done fine tuning the model with my own images.

- [00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=1198) And this is Stable Diffusion 3.5.

- [00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=1200) This is a really good image for Stable Diffusion 3.5, but it is not following the prompt.

- [00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=1205) The prompt has a man is riding a majestic black panther. However, there is no man in this image.

- [00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=1211) And in this case, again, the FLUX DEV is way better compared to the Stable Diffusion 3.5.

- [00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=1218) Again the FLUX DEV way better. I mean, look at this image. This is a very low quality image.

- [00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=1224) In this one, the FLUX DEV is again way better. So you can download this grid and look at yourself.

- [00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=1231) However, FLUX DEV is many times better than the Stable Diffusion 3.5, except this image very close.

- [00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=1239) But I can tell you that FLUX DEV is way, way better.

- [00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=1243) However, I will still do fine tuning and LoRA training research on Stable Diffusion 3.5,

- [00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=1249) because I believe the community will make it.

- [00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=1252) I will make amazing fine-tuned models of the Stable Diffusion 3.5, like the realistic vision, like the juggernaut XL.

- [00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=1260) So hopefully we will see that.

- [00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=1262) But for now, Stable Diffusion 3.5 is way, way worse than the FLUX dev, if you ask my opinion.

- [00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=1270) I mean, it is very rare that they are getting the same quality.

- [00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=1274) However, the prompt following the quality of the Stable Diffusion 3.5 is way, way worse than the FLUX.

- [00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=1282) I say that is as I say this as an unfortunate thing. However, this is the reality.

- [00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=1288) The FLUX DEV is way better.

- [00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=1290) Now I will show you how to use Stable Diffusion 3.5 Large model and the SwarmUI on the Massed

- [00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=1297) Compute with the newest model and the configurations.

- [00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=1300) So in the post, you will see that there is Massed Compute instructions. Go to that section with scrolling down.

- [00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=1307) There is registration link. Please use that. I appreciate that it is here.

- [00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=1312) After registering and logging in, set up your billing account, then go to the deploy.

- [00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=1317) We have a very special image here to use. You can use any GPU, but I recommend RTX A6000 GPU.

- [00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=1325) Select one. You can also rent multiple GPUs and speed up your generations with using the multi backend

- [00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=1333) of the SwarmUI. Actually, let's use at least 2 like this and select creator.

- [00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=1339) Image as SECourses and apply our coupon to reduce the price to half.

- [00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=1344) You see the price is $1.25 for 2 GPUs. When I verify, it will become half price.

- [00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=1352) So it is 31 cents per hour for single RTX A6000 GPU, then deploy.

- [00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=1357) Then it will show you new instance successfully created and just wait for initialization to be completed.

- [00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=1363) Meanwhile, if you haven't installed ThinLinc client yet. Click this link here.

- [00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=1369) And in here download version according to your computer.

- [00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=1373) I will use Windows then start it with clicking on it. Click yes. Click next. Accept. Next install.

- [00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=1380) Just it is next and install then finish. So in here, what you need to do is click options.

- [00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=1386) Go to the local devices, uncheck all. Click details for drives and we are going to add a synchronization folder.

- [00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=1393) This is a folder that you generate on your computer yourself. Click add. Then click this three dots icon.

- [00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=1399) Generate a folder wherever you want for synchronization between Massed Compute and your computer. In here select your synchronization folder.

- [00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=1407) Click OK. Make it read and write. Click OK. OK. And you are ready.

- [00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=1413) Just wait for initialization to be completed. OK. So our machine has started. You see status is running.

- [00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=1420) All we need to do is copy this IP address to here. Copy the username Ubuntu to here.

- [00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=1427) And copy your password to here and connect. Then click continue.

- [00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=1432) Since this is 2x GPU machine, it has 512 GB storage and 96 GB of RAM. And then click start.

- [00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=1440) You see starting ThinLinc session. Then we are on the remote machine. Now we have amazing features here.

- [00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=1447) It is so easy to use. We also have download models.

- [00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=1451) So you can either use this or you can open this link in your Massed Compute. Let me show you.

- [00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=1458) Like here. Copy paste. Download the models into the accurate folders.

- [00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=1463) Or you can use the prepared super fast downloader which is inside this post. Which I recommend. Let's go there.

- [00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=1471) Click here to download the downloader zip file.

- [00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=1474) Move it into your synchronization folder which is mass_compute in my case. Then go to the file here.

- [00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=1481) Go to the thin drives. Go to mass_compute.

- [00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=1485) This will be the folder name that you made as your synchronization folder.

- [00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=1488) Then move the file into the any folder that you wish. Like downloads folder. Then right click and extract here.

- [00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=1497) Enter inside the folder. Open Massed Compute download instructions. Copy this part. This is the installation part.

- [00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=1504) Then open a new terminal. Paste. And hit enter. Now the recommended models for this machine.

- [00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=1512) This is a 48 gigabytes machine. Download FP16 FLUX DEV. Download FP8

- [00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=1518) scaled Stable Diffusion 3.5 because it is working better. You may be wondering why.

- [00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=1523) I have shown this in the Windows tutorial part and also grids are available on the post on the article.

- [00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=1530) So you can also look there. And I recommend using the FP16 T5 with option 5.

- [00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=1538) So these are the options that I recommend for the Massed Compute. Then hit enter.

- [00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=1543) It is going to start downloads with the ultra fast speed as you are seeing right.

- [00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=1548) Now let me demonstrate you. So these are the download speeds. It is just mind-blowingly fast on the Massed Compute.

- [00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=1555) You will see that. So the models have been downloaded.

- [00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=1557) Now I will show you how to use them on Massed Compute very easily.

- [00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=1562) First of all we have update SwarmUI button here. So these buttons are for updating. Please run this icon.

- [00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=1571) After you double click it, it will update the SwarmUI and start its latest version. This is super important.

- [00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=1577) To update the SwarmUI. Whenever you start it. So you will get the very best, very latest version like this.

- [00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=1583) And it is it. It is done. The SwarmUI has been installed and updated to latest version.

- [00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=1588) So you can use this inside ThinLinc client. But I don't recommend it. It is slow.

- [00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=1593) How you can use it? Just close this.

- [00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=1596) And you will see that we have a button here run CloudFlare Stable SwarmUI. Double click it.

- [00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=1601) This will start the SwarmUI locally and also on the cloud accessible link. You see this is the link.

- [00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=1608) Right click and open the link. Then copy this link and open it in your computer.

- [00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=1614) So you see this is running on the Massed Compute. However, I can use it on my computer right now.

- [00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=1622) Since this is multiple GPU, I am also going to add a backend.

- [00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=1626) You can do this on your local computer as well. If you have multiple GPUs. It is so easy.

- [00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=1630) Copy this. And here. Click this ComfyUI self starting. Click OK. Copy paste this.

- [00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=1637) Moreover, if you are using 4000 series GPUs, add here --fast and set the GPU ID 1 and save.

- [00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=1645) So this one will run on the GPU ID 0, and this one will run on the GPU ID 1.

- [00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=1650) We can see that we have two GPUs in the server info tab.

- [00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=1654) So the usage is exactly same as on the Windows tutorial part, please follow that part.

- [00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=1661) All you need to do is select the models, set the configuration, and generate.

- [00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=1665) And if you want to use LoRAs on the Massed Compute, how you gonna use it?

- [00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=1670) For example, let's use this Stable Diffusion 3.5 LoRA. Copy its link, open it inside the Massed Compute, like this.

- [00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=1678) But the link was not copied, I will copy again, and open again. Because sometimes it happens, still fail it.

- [00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=1685) Right click, copy, and paste. Okay, it doesn't work, sometimes it doesn't work.

- [00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=1690) I will report this error one more time. So I manually opened the link here. Click download.

- [00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=1695) This is a model that you need to login, login, and download it.

- [00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=1699) After you have downloaded it, right click, and move to, and go to Ubuntu app, Stable SwarmUI.

- [00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=1706) By the way, this is latest SwarmUI. This is where SwarmUI installed on Massed Compute models, and inside LoRA.

- [00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=1713) So this is where you are supposed to put the LoRA models or the other models inside this folder.

- [00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=1719) So select it, and that's it. Then when I return to the public link here. I click LoRAs here and refresh.

- [00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=1725) And it is here. Now I can use it.

- [00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=1728) So I select the Stable Diffusion 3.5, set the settings as I have shown in the Windows, and use it.

- [00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=1734) So now I will show how to install SwarmUI on RunPod, and use the Stable Diffusion 3.5

- [00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=1741) Large and FLUX newest models.

- [00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=1744) Scroll down in the post and go to the RunPod instructions, then please use this link to register.

- [00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=1751) I appreciate that. After registering and logged in into your

- [00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=1755) account, set up your billing, set some credits, then go to the my Pods.

- [00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=1760) Go to the deploy. So you can also use permanent network storage system.

- [00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=1765) I have a full tutorial for it here. However, I'm not going to use it.

- [00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=1768) This is the permanent network storage. So go to the Pods, click deploy.

- [00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=1772) And I prefer to use Secure Cloud because it is way faster compared to Community Cloud recently.

- [00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=1779) From here, I prefer Texas 3, but you can use anything. And I'm going to use

- [00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=1785) RTX 4090 for speed, but you can use preferably L40S as well.

- [00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=1791) It is up to you.

- [00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=1791) If you use L40S, it will be even faster with the 16 bit, but it is not mandatory.

- [00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=1798) Click change template, select type torch here and search for RunPod PyTorch 2.1. This is working best.

- [00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=1805) Click edit template and set a volume disk as you need as much as the models that you

- [00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=1811) are going to use. Let's set it as 150 gigabytes.

- [00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=1815) And add 7801 port here. This is important to access the SwarmUI interface. Set overrides.

- [00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=1822) Click deploy on demand. Go to my Pods. Just wait until connect button appears.

- [00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=1828) You can also rent different Pods and get the best speed one having Pods. Then click connect button.

- [00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=1834) Connect the Jupyter lab. In the RunPod instructions, you see there is install linux.sh file. Click it.

- [00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=1841) Then use this icon to upload it into your workspace.

- [00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=1845) Make sure that it is named accurately like this if you have the previous files. So install-linux.sh file.

- [00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=1853) Then we are going to copy the command here to install. Open a new terminal.

- [00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=1857) Copy paste the command like this. It will start installation of the SwarmUI.

- [00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=1862) Once you see it started on the local URL like this, go to my Pods and connect to the 7801

- [00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=1868) port like this. Then click agree. Customize settings. Modern dark. Next. Just yourself on this PC. ComfyUI local.

- [00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=1878) I am not going to download anything but you can select next and yes I am sure install now.

- [00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=1883) Then follow the cmd window progress here. It is very fast to install.

- [00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=1888) So the installation of the SwarmUI has been completed. It is loaded on the RunPod.

- [00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=1893) You see we are connected from the RunPod proxy.

- [00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=1896) How you are going to download models on here to use them?

- [00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=1900) You need to enter inside the accurate folders like models. Like Stable Diffusion.

- [00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=1906) Then in the public post there is a repository link here. Click this link.

- [00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=1910) And you need to download these files with wget. They are all public. You can use.

- [00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=1915) However, I recommend to use our ultra fast and robust automatic models downloader. So click this post.

- [00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=1922) Download this SwarmUI model downloader zip file. Then go back to your workspace. Click this upload files.

- [00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=1930) Select the zip file. Right click. And extract archive. Then you will have all the files like this.

- [00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=1936) Open the RunPod download instructions txt file. And select this. Like this.

- [00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=1942) And open a new terminal and copy paste it. This will ask you options.

- [00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=1947) Okay since this is a 24 gigabytes having Pod with RTX 4090. I am going to use fp8 versions.

- [00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=1956) Normally I would recommend you to download the fp8 FLUX DEV scaled version.

- [00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=1962) However, currently it is not working with the RTX 4000 series. It works with 3000 series and RTX A6000 series.

- [00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=1971) So I reported this issue and hopefully it will get fixed.

- [00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=1975) When you are watching this tutorial therefore I recommend you to do this.

- [00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=1979) Download option 2, option 4, option 6, and option 8. Why? Because if you get error with option 2.

- [00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=1991) Then you can use the option 8. Since I have already downloaded them on this Pod.

- [00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=1996) You see they are all completed in a moment. Because it checked the files and verified they were downloaded previously.

- [00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=2004) How we are going to use it. Go to the models and refresh. We are in the RunPod proxy.

- [00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=2009) And they will appear like this. The usage is exactly same as I have shown in the Windows tutorial part.

- [00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=2016) So please watch that part. Do not skip it. And what if you want to use the LoRAs.

- [00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=2021) On the RunPod. To use the LoRAs on RunPod I have an excellent tutorial here which also explains how you

- [00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=2029) can download the gated models on RunPod. So watch this tutorial to learn it fully.

- [00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=2036) As a demonstration I am going to use this LoRA with Stable Diffusion 3.5 model.

- [00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=2041) The logic is same whether it is FLUX, it is SDXL, it is Stable Diffusion 1.5 or Stable Diffusion 3.5.

- [00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=2049) The logic is totally same. I am going to download this to my computer.

- [00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=2053) This is a relatively small LoRA so I can use this interface to upload.

- [00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=2059) Otherwise I would be using the runpodctl or the jupyter notebook as explained in this tutorial video.

- [00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=2066) So click this icon and select the model. In the bottom you will see that it is uploading from here.

- [00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=2073) You see it is uploading into the LoRA folder. This is where you put the LoRA files.

- [00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=2078) And in the bottom it written completed. And it is now completed.

- [00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=2082) We can see last modified here. So how are we going to use it? I click LoRAs and refresh.

- [00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=2087) And it is here. Now I can use it. So I select the Stable Diffusion 3.5.

- [00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOKhoO9a5s&t=2093) Set the settings as I have shown in the Windows and use it. So I hope you have enjoyed.
