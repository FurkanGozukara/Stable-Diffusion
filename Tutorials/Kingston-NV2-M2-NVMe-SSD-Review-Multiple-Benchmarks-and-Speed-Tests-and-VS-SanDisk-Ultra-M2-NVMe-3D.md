M.2 NVMe SSDs: The Future of Storage

Solid state drives (SSDs) have become the go-to storage solution for many consumers and professionals due to their faster speeds and durability compared to traditional hard drives. Among the various types of SSDs available, M.2 NVMe SSDs have gained popularity for their ability to deliver even faster speeds and improved performance. In this article, we will be taking a deep dive into M.2 NVMe SSDs and exploring the features and capabilities of two popular options: the Kingston NV2 M.2 NVMe SSD and the SanDisk Ultra M.2 NVMe 3D.

What is an M.2 NVMe SSD?

M.2 NVMe SSDs are a type of SSD that uses the M.2 form factor and the NVMe (Non-Volatile Memory Express) protocol to deliver high-speed data transfer rates. M.2 is a small, thin, and flexible form factor that is designed to be used in laptops, desktops, and other devices that require a compact and lightweight storage solution. The NVMe protocol is a newer and faster interface that is designed specifically for SSDs and allows them to achieve much higher speeds than traditional SSDs.

One of the main benefits of M.2 NVMe SSDs is their speed. They are able to achieve much higher read and write speeds compared to traditional SSDs, making them ideal for tasks such as booting up the operating system, opening and closing programs, and transferring large files. They also have lower latencies and faster access times, which means that they can access and transfer data faster than traditional SSDs.

Features of Kingston NV2 M.2 NVMe SSD

The Kingston NV2 M.2 NVMe SSD is a high-performance drive that is designed to deliver fast speeds and good performance. It is available in capacities of 250GB, 500GB, 1TB, and 2TB and comes with a five-year warranty. Some of the key features of the Kingston NV2 M.2 NVMe SSD include:

3D NAND technology: The Kingston NV2 M.2 NVMe SSD uses 3D NAND technology, which allows it to store more data in a smaller space and improve performance. 3D NAND is a type of flash memory that is stacked in layers, which allows it to achieve higher density and faster speeds than traditional NAND.

PCIe 3.0 x4 interface: The Kingston NV2 M.2 NVMe SSD has a PCIe 3.0 x4 interface.

Features of SanDisk Ultra M.2 NVMe 3D

The SanDisk Ultra M.2 NVMe 3D is another popular M.2 NVMe SSD that is designed to deliver fast speeds and good performance. It is available in capacities of 256GB, 512GB, and 1TB and comes with a three-year warranty.



### Video Transcription


- [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwkC-wgcZ5M&t=0) Greetings everyone. Today I am going to test&nbsp; two of my M.2 SSDs. The first one is my current&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwkC-wgcZ5M&t=7) C drive SanDisk Ultra M.2 NVMe 3D SSD. Let me&nbsp; show you. You see, it is almost full currently.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwkC-wgcZ5M&t=15) Therefore, I have purchased another SSD and I&nbsp; have just installed it into the computer and I&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwkC-wgcZ5M&t=23) haven't even initialized it yet. The other one is&nbsp; Kingston NV2 SSD. The form factor is M.2 2280. It&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwkC-wgcZ5M&t=34) is 2TB version. And I am going to use all of the&nbsp; major popular benchmarking software. Let me show&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwkC-wgcZ5M&t=44) you them. Each one of them: Anvil Storage,&nbsp; ATTO Disk Benchmark, CrystalDiskMark and&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwkC-wgcZ5M&t=52) AS SSD Benchmark. This is my current C drive&nbsp; SSD. First, I will do test of it, Then I will&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwkC-wgcZ5M&t=66) clone it bit by bit to my new hard drive,&nbsp; Restart Windows and I will do tests on them.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwkC-wgcZ5M&t=75) So you will be able to compare both hard drive&nbsp; features, both hard drive speeds. Also, I will&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwkC-wgcZ5M&t=84) make another video and I will show how I am going&nbsp; to clone my current M.2 SSD to my new M.2 SSD.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwkC-wgcZ5M&t=97) And before starting, let me also show how am&nbsp; I going to initialize newly installed SSD. I&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwkC-wgcZ5M&t=105) have typed control panel, administrative tools and&nbsp; from here, computer management and from storage,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwkC-wgcZ5M&t=115) disk management. And in here, you see, it&nbsp; is unallocated. I am going to set a simple&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwkC-wgcZ5M&t=122) volume and with this way you can assign it to&nbsp; a new drive. But I am not going to assign it&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwkC-wgcZ5M&t=130) right now because I am going to clone this drive&nbsp; into that one. And one more thing: I have made&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwkC-wgcZ5M&t=139) a stability test before logging into the Windows&nbsp; and in the motherboard. Both have passed. So let&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwkC-wgcZ5M&t=148) me quickly show the information of my computer.&nbsp; I have Intel Core i7 10700F version CPU. My main&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwkC-wgcZ5M&t=160) board is MAG B460M Mortar and I have 64GB memory,&nbsp; as you can see here. Okay, now I will do each of&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwkC-wgcZ5M&t=172) the benchmarks one by one. Okay, let's start.&nbsp; Okay, so the first test has been completed with&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwkC-wgcZ5M&t=180) Crystal Disk Mark 8.0.4x64 version. The versions&nbsp; are important. We have sequential 1MB reads,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwkC-wgcZ5M&t=194) as you see, like this. These are the values. I&nbsp; think it is pretty decent, As you consider that I&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwkC-wgcZ5M&t=202) have total read as 23TB and total write as 37TB.&nbsp; I also have open CPUZ SPD information, if you&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwkC-wgcZ5M&t=216) wonder. Now let's move to our next test, which&nbsp; is ATTO Disk Benchmark 4.00.0f2. Let's start.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwkC-wgcZ5M&t=229) Okay, so ATTO Disk Benchmark has also been&nbsp; completed. You see, after certain file size,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwkC-wgcZ5M&t=236) the speeds are not changing, as you can see.&nbsp; Also, don't worry that I am going to provide&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwkC-wgcZ5M&t=243) all of the application download links that&nbsp; I am using right now in the description of&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwkC-wgcZ5M&t=249) the video as well. So you will be able&nbsp; to also download them and test them.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwkC-wgcZ5M&t=254) Okay, now let's move to our next benchmark,&nbsp; which is AS SSD Benchmark 2.0. And the other&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwkC-wgcZ5M&t=264) thing is going like this. So I am not changing the&nbsp; default values, the sizes, here, as you can see.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwkC-wgcZ5M&t=271) Okay, so this benchmark has also been completed&nbsp; and these are the values. As you can see,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwkC-wgcZ5M&t=276) It is pretty decent. Now our final test, which&nbsp; is Anvil's Storage Utilities . Actually, this&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwkC-wgcZ5M&t=283) is pretty old testing benchmark. These are much&nbsp; more recent than this one. Okay, let's start it.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwkC-wgcZ5M&t=295) Okay, so the test has been completed and&nbsp; these are the values that we have obtained.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwkC-wgcZ5M&t=301) So let's take a screenshot of these results, save&nbsp; them, and after that I will clone this disk into&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwkC-wgcZ5M&t=309) the new disk and restart windows and repeat&nbsp; the test. So we will be able to compare them.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwkC-wgcZ5M&t=317) So I am going to click print screen,&nbsp; open my Paint.NET. Okay, and in here&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwkC-wgcZ5M&t=329) I am selecting the cropping tool. Okay,&nbsp; this is also another thing that you are&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwkC-wgcZ5M&t=335) learning right now. Okay, and let's save&nbsp; it into the desktop as test results.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwkC-wgcZ5M&t=346) Okay, it is saved it and now ready. Okay.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwkC-wgcZ5M&t=352) Okay, now I have cloned my SSD into the new&nbsp; drive and opened the windows. Let me show you.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwkC-wgcZ5M&t=361) So you. So you see, my C drive is now 2TB and&nbsp; this is the older drive I just had completed&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwkC-wgcZ5M&t=369) the tests on. I have opened the software.&nbsp; Let me show you the disk info from here.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwkC-wgcZ5M&t=377) Okay, Okay, So this is our C drive currently. So&nbsp; you see, this is the total host reads and this&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwkC-wgcZ5M&t=382) is total host right. So far, power on hours and&nbsp; everything is like this. So let's start our tests.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwkC-wgcZ5M&t=391) Tests have been completed. Now we are going to&nbsp; compare each one of them individually with the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwkC-wgcZ5M&t=398) previous hard disk test results. Okay, the first&nbsp; results are for ATTO Disk benchmark. As you can&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwkC-wgcZ5M&t=405) see, there is a huge difference in the small size&nbsp; data read and data write. It is three times faster&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwkC-wgcZ5M&t=414) in data writing. In reading, it is almost two&nbsp; times faster. Actually, if it is 1KB data, it is,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwkC-wgcZ5M&t=424) I can see, four times faster for reading. So in&nbsp; small sizes it is much better. For bigger size,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwkC-wgcZ5M&t=432) bigger size data read and data write: The write&nbsp; is almost 1.5 times faster, as you can see,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwkC-wgcZ5M&t=439) and reading is almost same. But in small sizes&nbsp; the difference is significant. So I can say that&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwkC-wgcZ5M&t=448) the new hard disk is much better overall. Okay,&nbsp; so I have opened the correct version of Crystal&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwkC-wgcZ5M&t=455) Disk Mark. Okay, now we have a fair comparison&nbsp; between the same version of Crystal Disk Mark,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwkC-wgcZ5M&t=462) as you can see. So you see the difference is&nbsp; significant once again. Only this one is a&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwkC-wgcZ5M&t=471) little bit worse, but in other areas, yeah,&nbsp; it is better overall. But the difference in&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwkC-wgcZ5M&t=479) Crystal Disk Mark is not as significant as&nbsp; in ATTO disk benchmark. I don't know why.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwkC-wgcZ5M&t=487) Okay, now let's compare on Anvil's Storage.&nbsp; Anvil's Storage also providing us a total score.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwkC-wgcZ5M&t=493) As you can see, the total score is almost as high,&nbsp; about 1.5 times. So let's look at the numbers.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwkC-wgcZ5M&t=504) So the number of megabytes we read sequentially&nbsp; for megabytes is much better and 4K much better.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwkC-wgcZ5M&t=512) So, overall, a significant improvement in Anvil's&nbsp; Storage benchmark, as well as supposed to be.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwkC-wgcZ5M&t=518) Okay. Anvil's Storage benchmark also shows all&nbsp; of the information in here and in here as well.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwkC-wgcZ5M&t=529) So it's a fair. It provides a fair and clear&nbsp; comparison for us. Okay, and the last comparison&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwkC-wgcZ5M&t=537) is for AS SSD benchmark. You see same version&nbsp; And once again there is a significant increase,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwkC-wgcZ5M&t=545) but not as significant as in Anvil's storage or&nbsp; ATTO benchmark. So we have got about, let's say,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwkC-wgcZ5M&t=554) 30% increase in total score. The read score is&nbsp; almost same, but the write score is much better&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwkC-wgcZ5M&t=564) with the new SSD. OK, OK, this is all for this&nbsp; video. I am going to upload a video about how did&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwkC-wgcZ5M&t=573) I clone and verify the files integrity. So if you&nbsp; wonder how did I clone my previous C drive into&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwkC-wgcZ5M&t=583) my new M2 SSD drive, check that out video as well.&nbsp; It is not on the page right now as I am recording,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwkC-wgcZ5M&t=592) but it will be when you are watching hopefully.&nbsp; Also, if you like it, please like subscribe and if&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwkC-wgcZ5M&t=599) you support us on our Patreon, we would appreciate&nbsp; very much. This is totally optional, but it would&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwkC-wgcZ5M&t=606) help us to make more and better quality videos&nbsp; hopefully. Hopefully, see you in another video.
