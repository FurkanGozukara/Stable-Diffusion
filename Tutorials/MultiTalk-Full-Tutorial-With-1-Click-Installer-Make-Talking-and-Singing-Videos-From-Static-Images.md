### Video Transcription


- [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=0) Greetings, everyone. Welcome to the Wan 2.1&nbsp; based MultiTalk tutorial. In this tutorial,

- [00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=6) I will show you how to literally one-click&nbsp; to install ComfyUI and MultiTalk and right

- [00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=12) away start generating amazing animations from&nbsp; static images. MultiTalk generates not only

- [00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=18) speaking videos but also impressive&nbsp; singing performances. Moreover,

- [00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=23) MultiTalk can even generate 30-second&nbsp; videos like this upcoming one.

- [00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=28) SECourses shows the way. Generate, compose, and play.

- [00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=42) Images and videos flow, Animation's 3D glow.

- [00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=57) Learning AI every day, SECourses shows the way. So as usual, I have prepared an amazing&nbsp; post. I really recommend you to read this

- [00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=63) post fully. I will begin with Windows, then&nbsp; Massed Compute, and then finally RunPod.

- [00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=70) First of all, we need to download the zip file.&nbsp; The link will be in the description of the video.

- [00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=74) So you see the latest zip file here. Move this&nbsp; zip file wherever you are going to install or

- [00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=80) your previous installation, like here. Replace.&nbsp; Then right-click and you need to extract all.

- [00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=86) I'm going to use here, extract files, okay.&nbsp; You see everything extracted here. Overwrite

- [00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=92) the previous files. You can follow these steps for&nbsp; a fresh installation as well, but you need to be

- [00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=98) careful is that do not have space character&nbsp; in your folder path or special characters.

- [00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=103) If you are first time following my&nbsp; videos, you need to have Windows

- [00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=108) requirements tutorial followed and installed.&nbsp; You need to have Python, Git, CUDA, FFmpeg,

- [00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=114) and other stuff. So follow this tutorial. The link&nbsp; will be also in the description of the video. This

- [00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=119) workflow has been tested on a fresh installation.&nbsp; So if you don't want to make a fresh installation,

- [00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=126) still it should work, but if it doesn't work,&nbsp; you need to make a fresh installation. Moreover,

- [00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=132) you can make fresh installation with your existing&nbsp; installation like this, which I'm going to show.

- [00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=138) So first of all, let's delete this empty&nbsp; folder. Then I'm going to enter inside my

- [00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=142) ComfyUI folder. What I need to do is I&nbsp; need to delete this virtual environment

- [00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=146) folder like this. It is going to delete.&nbsp; Okay, it is deleted. Then I also need to

- [00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=152) delete the custom nodes. You need to do&nbsp; this if it doesn't work. After doing that,

- [00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=157) first of all, I will do installation. The fresh&nbsp; installation is also same, what you need to do.

- [00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=162) Double-click windows_install.bat file. More&nbsp; info, run anyway. Do not run as administrator.

- [00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=170) Then you will get to this screen. I really&nbsp; recommend you to have Python 3.10, but you can

- [00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=175) also use Python 3.11 or 12. However, do not use&nbsp; Python 13. It will not work. So I will choose the

- [00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=183) option one. I'm going to use both Flash Attention&nbsp; and Sage Attention, three. I know that some of you

- [00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=188) are wondering whether we should use Sage Attention&nbsp; 2.2 plus. I tested it and it is same. It doesn't

- [00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=195) bring any speed benefits. So our Sage Attention&nbsp; is currently working with the best performance.

- [00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=202) Many of the libraries are automatically installed&nbsp; which you may need. Moreover, it is supporting

- [00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=207) RTX 5000 series GPUs as well, as well as RTX 4000&nbsp; series GPUs or 3000 series GPUs. If you have older

- [00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=215) GPUs like 2000 or 1000, some of the workflows&nbsp; may not work or they may work slower. However,

- [00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=222) starting from 3000 series GPUs, it is working just&nbsp; perfect. If you are making a fresh installation,

- [00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=227) it is exactly same. You just double-click and&nbsp; start it. Do not run anything as administrator

- [00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=233) unless I state it explicitly because if you run&nbsp; that way, it will break your installation. Just

- [00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=240) wait for installation to be completed. You need&nbsp; this step only if your existing ComfyUI doesn't

- [00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=245) work. And ComfyUI may get broken very easily,&nbsp; therefore I am showing you all the cases. And

- [00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=252) don't forget to follow this Windows requirements&nbsp; tutorial. This is mandatory only one time. All of

- [00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=257) my applications, AI applications, scripts will&nbsp; work if you follow this video just for once.

- [00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=264) Okay, so the installation has been completed. Then&nbsp; enter inside workflows folder, enter inside Kijai

- [00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=271) MultiTalk, and double-click install_MultiTalk.bat&nbsp; file. More info, run anyway. This will download

- [00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=279) and install necessary nodes that you need&nbsp; to run this workflow. So it is all automatic

- [00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=286) for you. You will not be wasting time with the&nbsp; ComfyUI manager. It will just handle everything

- [00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=292) automatically for you. Okay, everything has been&nbsp; installed. You see we have the workflows here,

- [00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=298) but we are not ready yet. What we need is go to&nbsp; the top of the page and you will see that we have

- [00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=305) SwarmUI Installer and Unified Massive Models&nbsp; Downloader. Go to here. This link will be also

- [00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=311) in the description of the video and download&nbsp; the latest version, SwarmUI model downloader.

- [00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=316) Extract this into anywhere. I'm just going to use&nbsp; my existing installation, so you also will see how

- [00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=324) I update, which is here. Then we need to extract&nbsp; it, extract files, overwrite your older files,

- [00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=331) so they will get updated. Then double-click&nbsp; windows_start_download_models_app.bat file.

- [00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=337) More info, run anyway. This will start the&nbsp; model downloader. Why we need this? Because

- [00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=342) with this, we will avoid manually&nbsp; downloading the necessary models.

- [00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=346) So what we need is, we need to give a custom path.&nbsp; Currently, it is using the SwarmUI path, but we

- [00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=352) need to give the ComfyUI model path. So my ComfyUI&nbsp; model path is here, models. So I will copy this,

- [00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=359) paste it here, then I will check this ComfyUI&nbsp; folder structure. Then you see there is ComfyUI

- [00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=365) bundles, download ComfyUI MultiTalk bundle. It&nbsp; will download all these models which are necessary

- [00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=371) to run this workflow. Some people are asking me&nbsp; how they can set custom path for ComfyUI models.

- [00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=378) ComfyUI has an amazing feature. You see there is&nbsp; extra_model_paths.yaml.example. Open this file

- [00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=385) with any text editor, read here and change it if&nbsp; you need custom paths. I don't use custom paths,

- [00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=392) but if you need, this is the way of it. So this&nbsp; downloader will download everything automatically

- [00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=396) for you with maximum speed, absolutely maximum&nbsp; speed. It will skip the existing models if you

- [00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=401) already have. We can see the download speed is&nbsp; here. It is around 100 megabytes per second.

- [00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=406) It is around 800 megabits. So it will use your&nbsp; entire internet speed. If you get errors here,

- [00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=413) it could be due to your antivirus, your VPN,&nbsp; your internet service provider, or temporary

- [00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=420) problem with the Hugging Face. So you need to keep&nbsp; trying until it is successful. You can see that it

- [00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=426) has queue of eight and it will download everything&nbsp; automatically for us. Just follow the status here.

- [00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=432) Okay, so all the models have been downloaded.&nbsp; As a last step, what we need is using

- [00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=438) windows_update_comfyui.bat file. Do not forget&nbsp; this. Double-click, more info, run anyway. This

- [00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=445) will update ComfyUI to the latest version. It&nbsp; will reinstall new versions of libraries and

- [00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=453) you see it is done already. Then all I need is&nbsp; windows_run_gpu.bat file, more info, run anyway.

- [00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=459) It will start the ComfyUI on my Windows computer.&nbsp; Okay, so the ComfyUI has been started. What I

- [00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=466) need is I need to drag and drop my workflow. So I&nbsp; have prepared a lot of different workflows based

- [00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=473) on what you need. So let's begin with simple&nbsp; 480p 10-second workflow. After 10 seconds,

- [00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=481) this workflow degrades in quality. However, up to&nbsp; 10 seconds, it is really good. So which parameters

- [00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=487) you need to change? These are same among all of&nbsp; the workflows. First of all, you need to load your

- [00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=492) image. I really recommend you to start with our&nbsp; test image. It is inside workflows. So load it.

- [00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=498) Then I really recommend you to start with&nbsp; test MP3 file. It is also inside the workflow

- [00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=504) folder. Let me show you. You see test.jpeg and&nbsp; test.mp3. Then you need to set your width and

- [00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=510) height according to your input image. This is&nbsp; 480p model and this is a tall image. Therefore,

- [00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=517) this is the resolution that I did set. If&nbsp; your image is not matching this resolution,

- [00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=521) it will keep proportion and crop it and center&nbsp; crop. You see the parameters are all here.

- [00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=528) Okay, what else you need to set? Number of blocks&nbsp; to swap. It is by default set to 25. If you are

- [00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=535) low on GPU, you can set this up to 40. How&nbsp; to decide? So open a CMD, type pip install

- [00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=543) nvitop like this. Then type nvitop and then you&nbsp; are going to pay attention to the watt usage of

- [00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=549) your GPU because if it is not using enough power,&nbsp; that means that it is using shared VRAM. Okay, so

- [00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=557) 25 is default and it is good. Then the next most&nbsp; important parameter you have to set is the prompt.

- [00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=564) So you see, by default, we have a man patiently&nbsp; singing, a close-up shot captures his expressive

- [00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=571) performance. You need to change this according to&nbsp; your image and which video you want to generate.

- [00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=576) And this is the default negative prompt. Then&nbsp; you can enable VAE tiling if you are on low VRAM.

- [00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=583) Other than that, you need to set number of frames.&nbsp; Now, this is super important. You need to set it

- [00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=589) according to the length of your audio or how much&nbsp; you want to animate. So my audio is 9 seconds,

- [00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=596) but it is more than 9 seconds actually. So you&nbsp; need to have precise timing. For precise timing,

- [00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=602) I am using MediaInfo from here. You see this&nbsp; MediaInfo and it shows me that it is 9 seconds,

- [00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=610) 960 milliseconds. You can use any application to&nbsp; get the exact resolution. This is just MediaInfo

- [00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=615) application, you can install it. So this is 9&nbsp; seconds, 960 milliseconds, which makes 9.960

- [00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=623) multiplied with 25, 249 frames. So I'm just&nbsp; going to use default 250 frames. However,

- [00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=630) this workflow is not exactly as precise. As you&nbsp; generate, you will see. Therefore, you may be need

- [00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=637) to set the frame count accordingly. And once&nbsp; you set frame count, your prompt, your input

- [00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=644) image and its resolution, actually you are ready.&nbsp; You don't need to change anything else. So let's

- [00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=648) just hit the run and let's see the result. So this&nbsp; is from my previous generation, it remembers it.

- [00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=654) So let's watch our VRAM usage and the watt usage.&nbsp; With this way, we can decide whether we are

- [00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=661) utilizing GPU with the maximum performance or&nbsp; not. If it is not, we can increase the block

- [00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=666) count or we can reduce the block count. This is&nbsp; the way of deciding block swap count. Moreover,

- [00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=672) you need a lot of RAM to run these models. If you&nbsp; don't have sufficient RAM, I really recommend you

- [00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=678) to set at least 100 GB of virtual RAM. If you&nbsp; don't know how to set a virtual RAM, type how to

- [00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=685) set virtual RAM and go to this link. It shows you&nbsp; how to set your virtual RAM. It is so easy. Okay,

- [00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=691) so our generation started. We are using 500 watts,&nbsp; which is amazing. You see it is sometimes dropping

- [00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=697) to 400 watts because it is doing some block&nbsp; swapping, but as you are seeing, 500 watts is

- [00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=703) amazing because my maximum is 575. So I am with&nbsp; over like 80% of performance and it is generating

- [00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=710) the video right now. It will be pretty quick even&nbsp; though I am recording a video right now. So I am

- [00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=715) using some GPU already. So let's see how much&nbsp; time it will take. If you still get some out of

- [00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=721) VRAM error, what you can do is you can enable VAE&nbsp; tiling wherever you see. For example, here there

- [00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=728) is enable VAE tiling. Also here, tiled VAE. So&nbsp; pay attention to the nodes and if you are seeing

- [00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=735) tiling, enable it if you get out of VRAM error,&nbsp; out of memory error. How you can know whether

- [00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=741) you got out of VRAM error or not? Just follow this&nbsp; CMD window, the terminal. And you may notice that

- [00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=747) it is generating with four steps to four steps.&nbsp; Yes, it cannot generate entirely the video at

- [00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=755) once because this is 250 frames and this model&nbsp; is actually made for 81 frames. Therefore, it is

- [00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=763) using some embedding system for this workflow and&nbsp; that is how it is generating parts by parts. This

- [00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=770) sampler is four steps, you cannot change it. This&nbsp; is generating decent quality, but I will show you

- [00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=776) a better quality as well. Moreover, as I said,&nbsp; this workflow is up to 10 seconds. If we need

- [00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=782) more than 10 seconds, what you need to use is the&nbsp; long context generation, which I will show next.

- [00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=789) Okay, so the video has been generated. It shows&nbsp; that it used maximum 16 GB of VRAM. It took 258

- [00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=797) seconds while I am recording full HD 4K resolution&nbsp; video. And we got the result here. So when I hover

- [00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=804) my mouse here, it will also show the audio. How&nbsp; you can save it? Right-click and you can save

- [00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=811) as preview. It will download it. Moreover, it&nbsp; is by default saved inside the output folder,

- [00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=818) inside ComfyUI, inside output, and you will see&nbsp; that the video is there, the PNG which contains

- [00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=825) the workflow is there, and there is also video&nbsp; itself without the audio file. This quality is

- [00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=831) not great. If we want a better quality, let's do&nbsp; it. So for better quality, we have long context

- [00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=838) generation. This is better quality and even&nbsp; I have 10 steps version of it. So let's see

- [00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=843) the 10 steps version. So drag and drop. With 10&nbsp; steps version, you don't need to set anything,

- [00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=849) everything is set. Let me set up from beginning&nbsp; what you need to change. So choose file to upload,

- [00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=855) let's use our test. Select our MP3 file, test.&nbsp; How many frames? It is around 250 frames again.

- [00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=862) Then what we else need to set? Nothing else,&nbsp; actually. We just need to set the prompt as usual,

- [00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=869) as before. So the prompt is here. A man patiently&nbsp; talking. It is remembering from my previous prompt

- [00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=876) probably. So let's actually close everything to&nbsp; open from beginning. I have been doing a lot of

- [00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=882) tests for you. Okay, let's open unsaved and let's&nbsp; drag and drop our high quality. Yes. Okay. Okay,

- [00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=889) I think it's still remembering. Anyway, not very&nbsp; important. So let's set up our parameters. Okay,

- [00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=895) 250 frames. This is extremely precise with&nbsp; frame count. It is working better than the

- [00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=900) other workflow. So a man patiently singing. Okay,&nbsp; I did set the frames count, I did set the prompt,

- [00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=907) I did set the load audio and image. I also&nbsp; need to set the resolution. So therefore,

- [00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=913) this will be 720 and 1280 pixel resolution since&nbsp; this is HD resolution. This will take longer than

- [00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=923) the previous generation. Why? Because this&nbsp; will be 10 steps, the quality version. It

- [00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=928) will be higher resolution and I'm going to use&nbsp; 25 block swaps again. It works with my RTX 4090,

- [00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=935) but depending on your GPU, you can just make it&nbsp; 40. Okay, you don't need to change anything else

- [00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=941) except if you get out of VRAM error, use enabled&nbsp; VAE tiling here. Then also there are some other

- [00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=948) enabled VAE tile here. You see tiled VAE and also&nbsp; there is VAE tiling also here. Or you can just

- [00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=956) use my low VRAM configuration. You see this one.&nbsp; This one is 15 GB and this one is like 8 GB. You

- [00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=964) need to test and see which one is working best for&nbsp; you and run. So let's see the result of this one

- [00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=971) and this one will use definitely more VRAM. It is&nbsp; going to load the new 720p model. Oh, by the way,

- [00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=978) if you already have your models, you need to&nbsp; select them from here. For this workflow, I am

- [00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=982) using 1 2.1 14 billion parameters image to video&nbsp; 720p GGUF Q8. This is excellent quality model. You

- [00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=992) can select this. For the previous workflow, I am&nbsp; using 480p. So it is up to you, select your model.

- [00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=999) If you are not using GGUF, you can also select&nbsp; quantization, but with GGUF, it is disabled.

- [00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=1004) And we are using Sage Attention. If you want&nbsp; other attentions like Flash Attention, you can

- [00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=1009) also change them from here. By the way, my auto&nbsp; installer doesn't have Flash Attention 3 yet, so

- [00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=1015) it wouldn't work. We don't have flex attention as&nbsp; well. We have Flash Attention 2, Sage Attention,

- [00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=1020) and SDPA. However, I can tell you that the Sage&nbsp; Attention is the best working one with the best

- [00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=1026) speed at the moment. Okay, I think we are going to&nbsp; start the steps. So this will take a lot of time.

- [00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=1032) However, the quality will be significantly better&nbsp; than the previous generation. Currently, I am

- [00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=1037) using 28 GB of VRAM with all the things running.&nbsp; Therefore, actually, I could reduce the number of

- [00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=1044) block swapping to speed up my generation. So it is&nbsp; up to you to test yourself. For example, I could

- [00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=1050) make this 20. It would use more of my VRAM, more&nbsp; of my GPU, and it would be faster in that case.

- [00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=1057) This is how it works. Also on the CMD, if you pay&nbsp; attention, you will see that it is showing how

- [00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=1063) much of the model is on the CPU, offloaded block&nbsp; swapping, and how much of it on the GPU right now.

- [00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=1071) Okay, so our video has been completed and I will&nbsp; make a comparison, but before making a comparison,

- [00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=1078) if you don't like the results, what you can&nbsp; do is trying different seeds. So currently,

- [00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=1084) this is set as seed 8. When you change this&nbsp; seed, you may get a perfect output. So therefore,

- [00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=1091) you can try changing seeds and see if you are&nbsp; getting a better result or not. It is totally

- [00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=1096) up to you. Moreover, with ComfyUI, you can just&nbsp; change this and click run and it will queue,

- [00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=1102) change it, click run, it will queue. You can&nbsp; also make multiple generations and so on. But

- [00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=1108) I will just terminate everything. So how am I&nbsp; going to compare these two generated videos? We

- [00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=1116) have an upcoming amazing application,&nbsp; Ultimate Video Upscaler. Hopefully,

- [00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=1122) it will be published this week or maybe next week.&nbsp; It is almost completed. This application has been

- [00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=1129) developed with the mindset of professional&nbsp; level upscaling. So it has so many features.

- [00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=1135) It is almost done. I am going to use the output&nbsp; comparison tool we have here. So we have up to

- [00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=1143) four videos comparison. Let's select the&nbsp; two outputs and make a comparison video.

- [00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=1149) I am going to use the first generation, which is&nbsp; here, and the second generation, which is here.

- [00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=1157) So the left one will be the 480p default workflow&nbsp; and the right one will be the high quality 720p.

- [00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=1165) So let's make a side-by-side comparison. It&nbsp; is really fast, the comparison video. Okay,

- [00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=1170) it is made. Let's download it. Now I will&nbsp; play it. So let's see the difference.

- [00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=1175) SECourses lights the way, through&nbsp; the maze where the data play.

- [00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=1185) As we can see, there is a huge, huge difference&nbsp; in quality. I can try different prompts,

- [00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=1192) different seeds, and get better quality, but&nbsp; this is how it works. So I can tell you that

- [00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=1198) the long context has a better quality than&nbsp; the default 10-second workflow in many cases,

- [00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=1204) not in all cases, but in many cases. I&nbsp; cannot say that it will work every case.

- [00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=1209) So it is up to you to test, unfortunately.&nbsp; The testing is the big part of AI generation,

- [00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=1215) finding the very best workflow for your usage&nbsp; case. But I did a lot of testing and I have

- [00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=1221) prepared all these presets, the workflows&nbsp; for you, so you can use them right away.

- [00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=1226) If you are wondering how I made the videos at&nbsp; the beginning of the tutorial, at the intro,

- [00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=1233) so basically, I have used the free credits of&nbsp; the 11Labs, generated audios with text-to-speech,

- [00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=1240) downloaded them, gave my audio file, image, and&nbsp; I just changed the prompt as a man talking or a

- [00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=1249) character talking, such as that. But I didn't&nbsp; like the 11Labs audio quality. Definitely,

- [00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=1255) it is not that great. And I am using the&nbsp; 11Labs version 3 alpha, the very best

- [00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=1260) version they have. Therefore, hopefully, I will&nbsp; make the greatest local text-to-speech for you,

- [00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=1267) hopefully in near future. But this is how I made.&nbsp; So basically, uploading the files as I have shown

- [00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=1273) and generating the videos until I get the result&nbsp; I want. Even right now, I am generating some of

- [00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=1280) the intro videos that you are going to see them&nbsp; at the beginning of the tutorial, hopefully.

- [00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=1285) Now, I am going to begin showing you how to use&nbsp; this amazing workflow on Massed Compute. If you

- [00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=1292) don't have a powerful GPU, you can use Massed&nbsp; Compute cloud service. So I really recommend

- [00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=1297) you to watch the first part of the tutorial,&nbsp; then you can return back here and continue.

- [00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=1304) So first of all, we need to download the zip&nbsp; file. The link will be in the description of

- [00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=1307) the video. Put this zip file into any folder&nbsp; like this. So let's extract it. Why extract?

- [00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=1313) Because we need to get the workflows from here&nbsp; and also we need the instructions TXT file. You

- [00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=1318) see Massed Compute instructions. I will show&nbsp; from beginning like you have never watched

- [00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=1323) my previous Massed Compute tutorials. First of&nbsp; all, read these instructions file. This includes

- [00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=1329) everything that you need. I really recommend&nbsp; you to follow this link to register Massed

- [00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=1334) Compute. So just double-click. So register, log&nbsp; in, then add some billing, set up your balance,

- [00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=1341) then go to deploy. Massed Compute interface&nbsp; slightly changed. Now our coupon works on

- [00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=1347) every GPU and you can find that RTX 6000 Ada has&nbsp; a best, as a best price-performance GPU. But if

- [00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=1356) you want speed, you can use like A100 or H100.&nbsp; Let's go with H100. So GPU H100, quantity one.

- [00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=1364) This is super important. First of all, let's&nbsp; select the creator as a category and image as

- [00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=1368) an SECourses because my installers, my scripts&nbsp; are made for this image. This image already has

- [00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=1375) SwarmUI and other features, but we are going to&nbsp; use manual installation of ComfyUI. So currently,

- [00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=1380) this is 2.35 dollars per hour. Let's apply our&nbsp; coupon, SECourses, verify. And now you see H100,

- [00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=1389) which is one of the very best GPUs that you can&nbsp; get is 1.76 dollars per hour. And this machine

- [00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=1396) has over 1 terabyte disk space. Disk space is&nbsp; also important when you download different models

- [00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=1402) and install. So let's deploy. The slowest part of&nbsp; the Massed Compute is the initial initialization,

- [00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=1408) but after that, it is like 10 times, 20 times&nbsp; faster than RunPod because their disks are very,

- [00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=1415) very faster. So we just need to wait our&nbsp; machine to be initialized. Meanwhile, if you

- [00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=1420) don't have the ThinLinc client, if you didn't set&nbsp; it previously, so click here. From here, download

- [00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=1427) according to your machine. Whether you are using&nbsp; MacBook, Apple, whether you are using Linux, you

- [00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=1432) see it is supporting a lot of different operating&nbsp; systems. I am Windows, so let's download this. So

- [00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=1438) open it with clicking. It will ask you permission,&nbsp; click yes, next, accept, next, default, install,

- [00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=1446) run ThinLinc client. Then first of all, you&nbsp; need to set your shared folder. We will use

- [00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=1451) shared folder to transfer small files. So I will&nbsp; go to local devices, clipboard synchronization,

- [00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=1458) drives. Okay. So I will click this details and in&nbsp; here, remove everything and click add, click this

- [00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=1465) three dots icon, select a folder where you want&nbsp; to synchronize. So I have a folder here named as

- [00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=1472) Massed Compute shared folder. Okay, make it read&nbsp; and write so I can both upload and download and

- [00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=1478) okay. And these others are unchecked. You can also&nbsp; make some speed optimizations. So everything is

- [00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=1484) good. Okay. Now all I need is just waiting this&nbsp; machine to be initialized. If you're wondering

- [00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=1489) what is this end existing session does, it will&nbsp; close all of the applications on the cloud machine

- [00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=1496) and then connect. Use this only when you cannot&nbsp; access the machine because it will terminate all

- [00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=1502) the running applications. You will have the files,&nbsp; but the running applications will get terminated.

- [00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=1507) Okay, so the machine has been started. Let's open&nbsp; the ThinLinc client again. Copy this IP address,

- [00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=1514) paste here like this. Then copy username, paste&nbsp; here. Then copy password and paste here. Then

- [00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=1521) connect. Click continue. Wait for connection&nbsp; to start. Click start. Do not wait here. It

- [00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=1527) is starting the session and the Massed Compute&nbsp; machine has been started. This is running on

- [00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=1533) a remote server. Whatever I do here will be&nbsp; made on a remote server, not on my computer.

- [00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=1540) We already have SwarmUI, OneTrainer, Kohya, a&nbsp; lot of stuff installed here. So you can right

- [00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=1548) away start using SwarmUI. First of all, you should&nbsp; update it with run stable SwarmUI update, then you

- [00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=1554) can use Cloudflare stable SwarmUI. However, today&nbsp; I'm going to show you how to install ComfyUI and

- [00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=1559) use it. Remember, we had the zip file here, so&nbsp; copy it, put it into synchronization folder that

- [00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=1566) you did set, which is here, Massed Compute shared&nbsp; folder in my case. You can set anything you want.

- [00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=1573) Once you get this, just cancel, you don't need&nbsp; it. Then enter home folder from here, scroll

- [00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=1579) down and you will see Thin drives. This is your&nbsp; synchronization folder with your computer. You see

- [00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=1584) the folder appeared here in my computer. When I&nbsp; enter inside it, I will see the files that I have

- [00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=1591) on my computer. So do not install anything here.&nbsp; Drag and drop it into downloads folder. Wait for

- [00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=1598) copy operation to be completed. ThinLinc client is&nbsp; extremely slow to copy big files, but you can copy

- [00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=1605) small files like this one. Even this 12 megabyte&nbsp; file took a lot of time. If you want to transfer

- [00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=1611) big files, you can use Google Drive, you can use&nbsp; OneDrive, Hugging Face. I also have a tutorial for

- [00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=1617) that. Just reply me and I will link that to you.&nbsp; So right-click and extract here. Then enter inside

- [00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=1624) it. First of all, we will install the ComfyUI.&nbsp; So you see Massed Compute instructions, read

- [00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=1630) TXT file, double-click it. Then copy this part.&nbsp; This is the installer. Return back to the folder,

- [00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=1637) click this three dots icon here, open in terminal.&nbsp; So pay attention that you are in the same folder

- [00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=1642) where you have extracted. You see ComfyUI version&nbsp; 35, ComfyUI version 35. Right-click and paste and

- [00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=1648) hit enter. It will start the installation of&nbsp; ComfyUI. Just wait it until it is completed.

- [00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=1655) Okay, so the ComfyUI installation&nbsp; has been completed. As a next step,

- [00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=1659) we will install the workflow nodes. So enter&nbsp; inside Kijai MultiTalk and you will see that

- [00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=1666) there is RunPod Massed Compute instructions&nbsp; TXT file. Let's copy the command and start

- [00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=1673) the terminal in the same folder here. This&nbsp; is super important. Paste it and hit enter

- [00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=1679) and it will install all of the necessary&nbsp; nodes into the accurate folder. Okay,

- [00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=1684) it is done. Now, final step, which is downloading&nbsp; the necessary models. You see under this zip file,

- [00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=1691) we have SwarmUI Installer and Unified Massive&nbsp; Models Downloader. So open this post. The link

- [00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=1697) will be also in the description of the video.&nbsp; Download the latest version of the zip file. Then

- [00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=1702) move this zip file into your shared folder. You&nbsp; can also directly log into your Patreon account

- [00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=1708) in this machine and also download directly&nbsp; there, but it is a choice. So go to home,

- [00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=1714) Thin drives, shared folder. Whatever I put here&nbsp; will be also appearing on my computer. So drag

- [00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=1722) and drop this into downloads folder. Wait for&nbsp; copy to be completed. Okay, it is completed.

- [00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=1727) Right-click and extract here. Then enter inside&nbsp; the folder and you will see Massed Compute model

- [00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=1733) download instructions TXT file. Double-click it.&nbsp; All you need to do is just copy this entirely,

- [00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=1739) open a terminal in the same folder, right-click&nbsp; and paste and hit enter. It will install and start

- [00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=1745) the application in a moment to download models.&nbsp; Okay, the application has been started. First of

- [00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=1751) all, we need to give the base download path. This&nbsp; is super important. Where is the path? Go back

- [00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=1757) to your downloads and ComfyUI installation.&nbsp; Enter inside ComfyUI and enter inside models

- [00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=1763) folder. Then control L, it will select the path,&nbsp; control C, return back and paste it here. You see,

- [00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=1771) home/ubuntu/downloads/comfyui_version_35/comfyui/models.&nbsp; Wherever you have installed. Then delete

- [00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=1778) this last part and select this ComfyUI folder&nbsp; structure. Then click this ComfyUI bundles and

- [00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=1784) drop down and go to the ComfyUI MultiTalk bundle&nbsp; and download ComfyUI MultiTalk bundle. Then follow

- [00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=1790) the terminal. It will download all the models&nbsp; ultra fast. One of the big advantages of the

- [00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=1797) Massed Compute is it is really, really fast.&nbsp; Let's see the download speed. So we see 500

- [00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=1802) megabytes per second, 1 gigabytes per second.&nbsp; It is like 8 gigabits per second. So you see,

- [00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=1810) 10 gigabytes of file is downloaded in 20 seconds&nbsp; only. It will be super fast. Don't worry.

- [00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=1816) All right, so the models have been downloaded. Now&nbsp; we are ready to begin. The rest is exactly same

- [00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=1822) as in the Windows tutorial part. All we need to is&nbsp; just start the ComfyUI. So return back to ComfyUI,

- [00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=1830) Massed Compute instructions, read TXT file, and&nbsp; we are going to start with this command. So open

- [00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=1837) a terminal in this folder, pay attention to the&nbsp; folders, open terminal, right-click and paste,

- [00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=1843) and it will start the ComfyUI locally in the&nbsp; Massed Compute. So you can use this inside

- [00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=1849) Massed Compute as you wish, 100% private.&nbsp; If you want to access it from your computer,

- [00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=1856) we also have options like connecting by the IP or&nbsp; with ngrok. I will show the connecting with IP. So

- [00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=1865) let's see the starting. If you get some such error&nbsp; messages like this one, it is not important. Okay,

- [00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=1872) we are getting started. Yes, it started. So&nbsp; click this link to open it in the browser and

- [00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=1879) the ComfyUI started. Now I can drag and drop my&nbsp; workflow to start using it. So enter inside the

- [00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=1887) workflow and let's do a quick test with this one.&nbsp; So drag and drop it and I need to load the file.

- [00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=1894) This file has to be inside the Massed Compute&nbsp; right now because it is running in the cloud

- [00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=1899) machine. So I will just use the test image here&nbsp; like this one and I will use this example file

- [00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=1908) we have as well in the workflows in here, test&nbsp; MP3. And that's it. Now I can generate it. All

- [00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=1915) we need to do is just click run and it should&nbsp; start running. Let's follow the terminal. Okay,

- [00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=1921) it is downloading some of the files first,&nbsp; that fee files it need to download from a

- [00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=1926) remote repository. It is fine. Then it will&nbsp; start processing. Okay, so the generation has

- [00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=1931) been started. This workflow was optimized&nbsp; for Windows low VRAM GPUs. Therefore,

- [00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=1938) it is not working with the maximum efficiency&nbsp; right now. To make it maximum efficiency, you

- [00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=1945) need to set the number of block swap to zero for&nbsp; this workflow. I have explained it all of this in

- [00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=1952) the Windows tutorial part. So if you have watched&nbsp; that part, it is fine. After setting that as zero,

- [00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=1958) at your next generation, it will be faster. So&nbsp; the video is getting generated. How you can access

- [00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=1965) this from your computer, not inside from Massed&nbsp; Compute? It is also easy. So you need to get

- [00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=1971) your IP, then use this port, which is the default&nbsp; starting port. How you're going to do that? Return

- [00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=1978) back to your Massed Compute interface and copy&nbsp; this URL. Then type the port to the end of it,

- [00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=1986) which is 8188 and hit enter. Then you will be able&nbsp; to access the ComfyUI from your computer as I am

- [00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=1996) accessing right now. You see, it started. So this&nbsp; is the way of it. Now I can use it as it is in my

- [00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=2002) computer, but it will run in the remote machine&nbsp; completely. However, from my browser, I will be

- [00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=2008) able to download the generated video, I will be&nbsp; able to upload images. Let me demonstrate you.

- [00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=2014) So let's drag and drop the workflow, then choose&nbsp; file to upload, upload whichever the file you want

- [00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=2021) from your computer. This is in my computer. So&nbsp; you see, from directly my computer, I can upload

- [00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=2027) and I can generate. Let's set the block swap to&nbsp; zero. By the way, let's see if the previous one

- [00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=2033) was generated because we shouldn't run twice.&nbsp; Yes, previous one was already generated. Then I

- [00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=2039) will just run and it will generate the video. You&nbsp; see, I am accessing it from my computer right now,

- [00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=2046) not from Massed Compute, and I will be able&nbsp; to download the generated video from here.

- [00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=2052) To monitor the progress when you are running on&nbsp; your computer, you need to look at the interface.

- [00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=2059) You need to look at the CMD window, the terminal.&nbsp; By the way, this long context workflow is way, way

- [00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=2067) slower than the other workflow for some reason. So&nbsp; therefore, when you need maximum quality, use the

- [00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=2075) long context workflow, but if you want something&nbsp; faster, use the other workflow. From that, what I

- [00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=2081) mean is 10-second workflow is way faster compared&nbsp; to the long context workflow. Okay, so the video

- [00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=2088) has been generated. This was generated in Massed&nbsp; Compute, but it is available in my browser. So

- [00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=2094) how can I save it? I can right-click and save&nbsp; preview and it will download into my computer

- [00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=2100) as you are seeing right now. Or you can transfer&nbsp; all the files from the Massed Compute. How? Go to

- [00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=2107) the ComfyUI installation like this, go to ComfyUI,&nbsp; go to outputs here, then you see the entire files

- [00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=2115) are here. Copy the whichever one you want. So&nbsp; let's copy the entire folder like copy, home,

- [00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=2122) Thin drives, and enter inside shared folder and&nbsp; paste it. This pasting may take time because it

- [00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=2130) will synchronize it with your computer. Depending&nbsp; on how many files you have, it may take time. So

- [00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=2136) what you can do is like you can log into your&nbsp; OneDrive, Google Drive, upload it there, upload

- [00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=2142) to any platform and download from your computer.&nbsp; However, for small files, it is fine. When I go

- [00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=2148) back to my computer, you see the files already&nbsp; arrived into my computer. There is one another

- [00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=2153) thing that I want to show before I end the Massed&nbsp; Compute part. So right-click and quit all windows.

- [00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=2160) So I will close everything. Then control alt D, it&nbsp; will minimize all the open windows. First of all,

- [00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=2168) I will update the SwarmUI because I will show you&nbsp; how you can use this manually installed ComfyUI

- [00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=2174) with the SwarmUI we have in the Massed Compute.&nbsp; This is pre-installed. It is coming with our SE

- [00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=2180) courses image. So it updated the SwarmUI to the&nbsp; latest version and started. Then go to server,

- [00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=2186) go to backends, and you see this is the backend&nbsp; it is using. Now I am going to give my manually

- [00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=2193) installed ComfyUI backend. So it is inside&nbsp; downloads, inside the ComfyUI, ComfyUI here,

- [00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=2200) control L, it will select the path, control C,&nbsp; and click this green, paste it like this. You see,

- [00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=2207) starting from home, okay, like this.&nbsp; /home/ubuntu/downloads/comfyui/comfyui

- [00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=2212) and main.py, then save. So instead of the&nbsp; backend it comes up with, it will use my

- [00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=2219) installed backend. So now you need to just wait&nbsp; it to restart the backend and load everything. It

- [00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=2225) will install the missing necessary libraries&nbsp; at the first time. So let's just wait. Okay,

- [00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=2230) it is loaded. Now it is using the backend that&nbsp; I have pre-installed. So you can use it locally

- [00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=2236) right now. If you want to access it from your&nbsp; computer, it is so easy. Close this window,

- [00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=2241) control alt D, and use run Cloudflare stable&nbsp; SwarmUI. This will generate a secure URL. So it is

- [00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=2247) here. Open it with control clicking, and now I can&nbsp; access this link from my computer, from my phone,

- [00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=2255) from my tablet, wherever I want. We also have some&nbsp; pre-downloaded models like SDXL base model. So

- [00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=2261) let's just type a fast car and see the generation.&nbsp; To see the logs with the SwarmUI, always server,

- [00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=2268) logs, and debug menu. It is right now using the&nbsp; ComfyUI backend that we have installed. You can

- [00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=2275) see here. It is the latest version with the&nbsp; latest libraries. So this is how you can use

- [00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=2280) ComfyUI on Massed Compute, also with SwarmUI, and&nbsp; it is generated. It is working perfectly fine.

- [00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=2286) One more thing is that if you stop your machine,&nbsp; it will not stop billing. So after I stopped it,

- [00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=2293) it doesn't matter. I have to delete this instance&nbsp; on Massed Compute so that it will not use my

- [00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=2299) credits anymore. So let's end this to delete this&nbsp; Massed Compute part and I will begin RunPod. Okay,

- [00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=2307) it is gone. Everything is gone. So make sure that&nbsp; you did back up your data before you delete it.

- [00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=2313) Okay, now we are going to see how to use&nbsp; this model, MultiTalk on RunPod. You need

- [00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=2320) to watch Windows tutorial part at the very&nbsp; least. So download the latest zip file. You

- [00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=2326) see that now it is version 36. It was 35 in&nbsp; the previous two parts. I made an update. I

- [00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=2333) added --use-sage-attention to the prompts and&nbsp; fixed an error in the one particular workflow.

- [00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=2341) So move this zip file into any folder and extract&nbsp; it. So extract all like this. Then double-click

- [00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=2348) and open RunPod instructions read TXT file. This&nbsp; is important. First of all, you need to register

- [00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=2355) RunPod. Please use this link. I appreciate that.&nbsp; After registration and sign in, put some credits

- [00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=2362) into your account from billing like from here.&nbsp; Then go to the pods and we are going to deploy.

- [00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=2369) This is the newest interface. So click deploy. You&nbsp; can use pretty much any GPU. However, if you want

- [00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=2376) some speed, you can use RTX Pro 6000. This is a&nbsp; really good GPU with huge amount of VRAM. First

- [00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=2383) of all, we need to select our template. So select&nbsp; the template Torch 2.2.0. So type Torch here,

- [00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=2391) then select the Torch 2.2.0. Then you need to&nbsp; edit template from here. Make the volume disk

- [00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=2399) 200 GB if you are going to download more models,&nbsp; make it bigger, and you need to add a port here,

- [00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=2406) which is 3001. We will use this port to connect&nbsp; ComfyUI. Set overrides, deploy on demand.

- [00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=2414) RunPod is extremely slow at the model loadings,&nbsp; installation. It shows you some huge speed here,

- [00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=2422) but you never get it because it is shared with&nbsp; so many other people. So it is totally up to your

- [00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=2428) chances. The machines will start initially quickly&nbsp; because we are using official PyTorch templates.

- [00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=2434) So once you see it is initialized like this,&nbsp; click connect and click the Jupyter Lab. Even if

- [00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=2439) it is not ready, click it and it will open in most&nbsp; cases like this one. Then click this arrow icon,

- [00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=2447) go back where you have downloaded the zip file and&nbsp; upload it. In the bottom of screen, you see it is

- [00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=2452) uploading. So wait for upload to be completed. You&nbsp; can also use RunPod CTL. I explain it in another

- [00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=2458) tutorial video. RunPod CTL is amazing to transfer&nbsp; big files between RunPod and your computer. Okay,

- [00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=2465) then right-click and extract archive. After that,&nbsp; click this refresh icon and everything extracted.

- [00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=2471) You see RunPod instructions read TXT file. Just&nbsp; copy this command. This is for installation. Plus

- [00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=2478) icon, new terminal, paste it and hit enter.&nbsp; Now you need to wait for installation to be

- [00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=2483) completed. The installation may take 10 minutes,&nbsp; 20 minutes, 30 minutes, depending on the pod you

- [00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=2489) got. The pod could be broken. So there are&nbsp; so many cases which can happen. Therefore,

- [00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=2494) I am recommending Massed Compute. The installation&nbsp; is not even started yet. We are still waiting for

- [00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=2500) some reason. The pods are terrible in most cases,&nbsp; unfortunately. The GPUs are good, but RunPod is

- [00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=2507) losing from the disks and the network speed they&nbsp; have. Okay, the installation started. If you see

- [00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=2514) the installation is too slow, just terminate the&nbsp; machine and get a new machine. I'm just waiting

- [00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=2519) for installation to see the speed, but so far it&nbsp; is very slow. We can also deploy another machine

- [00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=2525) and we can make some filters from here like&nbsp; NVMe disk and we can make the region like US

- [00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=2533) like this one. There is no Pro 6000 here. So we&nbsp; can make it like Texas and there is no. These are

- [00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=2541) usually better, but none of them are available.&nbsp; Okay, the installation speed is looking decent,

- [00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=2546) so we don't need a new machine. Meanwhile, it is&nbsp; installing, we can start downloading models since

- [00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=2552) it will take time on RunPod. For downloading&nbsp; models, we are going to use SwarmUI Installer

- [00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=2558) and Unified Massive Downloads here. So click&nbsp; this link, download the latest zip file from

- [00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=2563) here. I really recommend you to read these posts&nbsp; because they include a lot of information. Then

- [00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=2570) we will click this upload files, upload the&nbsp; zip file, wait for it to be uploaded, and the

- [00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=2575) zip file has been uploaded here. You see the zip&nbsp; file is here. Right-click, let's fix the name,

- [00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=2580) and you see the zip file has been uploaded. It is&nbsp; here. Right-click and extract archive. Then click

- [00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=2586) refresh and we can see that there is RunPod model&nbsp; download instructions TXT file. Double-click it,

- [00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=2592) copy this, and open a new terminal and paste it.&nbsp; We are still installing the ComfyUI and meanwhile,

- [00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=2599) we will download the necessary MultiTalk models,&nbsp; 1 2.1, some other models that it needs. Everything

- [00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=2606) will be automatically downloaded. Wait for Gradio&nbsp; live share here. Okay, it is here. Click this,

- [00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=2612) open the Gradio live link. This is all&nbsp; running on RunPod, on a cloud machine,

- [00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=2617) not on my PC. Okay, interface started. First of&nbsp; all, we need to get the models folder path. It is

- [00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=2623) inside ComfyUI and it is models. So right-click&nbsp; and copy path. Then go to path here, delete it,

- [00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=2630) paste. You see it is missing a backslash at&nbsp; the beginning, so put it like this. This is

- [00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=2636) super important. Then select this checkbox,&nbsp; go to ComfyUI bundles and download ComfyUI

- [00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=2642) MultiTalk bundle. So it will download everything.&nbsp; Let's see the download speed. It is looking

- [00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=2647) decent right now. Okay, slow, getting faster.&nbsp; Yeah, decent speed. And it's also installing

- [00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=2654) the ComfyUI. All I need to do is right now&nbsp; just wait for installation to be completed.

- [00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=2659) Okay, the model downloads have been completed.&nbsp; Now all we need to do is just wait for ComfyUI

- [00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=2666) installation to be completed. One advantage of&nbsp; the RunPod is that you can turn off the machine,

- [00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=2673) it will use a very little amount of money&nbsp; from your account, then when you restart it,

- [00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=2680) when you start it again, all you need to do&nbsp; is just starting command and it will right

- [00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=2684) away work. So you will not reinstall it.&nbsp; This is the advantage of RunPod. You can

- [00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=2690) also use RunPod permanent storage. I also have a&nbsp; RunPod permanent storage tutorial in the readme

- [00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=2696) file. You can see here, it is so easy. So that&nbsp; these are the advantages of the RunPod compared

- [00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=2703) to Massed Compute. The permanent storage or&nbsp; turning off the machine and starting again.

- [00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=2709) When you turn off the machine, it uses very&nbsp; little amount of money. Then after starting it,

- [00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=2714) you just run the starting command. Okay, we are&nbsp; still waiting for installation to be completed.

- [00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=2720) Okay, so the installation has been completed. As&nbsp; a next step, we need to install the workflow. As

- [00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=2726) in the other videos, so go to the workflows&nbsp; and go to the Kijai MultiTalk and you will

- [00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=2732) see RunPod Massed Compute instructions. Just&nbsp; copy this and open a new terminal inside here,

- [00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=2739) new terminal. You see the path is here. Copy,&nbsp; paste it, and it will install the necessary

- [00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=2746) nodes we need to run the MultiTalk. This part is&nbsp; the fastest part. Okay, it is done. Now we are

- [00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=2752) ready to start. Go back to ComfyUI from here.&nbsp; You see I'm using this navigation, workspace,

- [00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=2759) then open the RunPod instructions read TXT file.&nbsp; This has command to start the ComfyUI. As I said,

- [00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=2767) if you restart the machine, if you stop and&nbsp; start, you will run this. Terminal, I am inside

- [00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=2773) this path and paste it. Then this will start the&nbsp; ComfyUI with the necessary models and the nodes

- [00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=2780) and the workflow. We have everything ready.&nbsp; And you will notice that it is using the Sage

- [00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=2786) Attention. So my installer is extremely advanced.&nbsp; It is installing the pre-compiled Sage Attention,

- [00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=2793) Flash Attention, xformers, the very best libraries&nbsp; that you need to obtain the maximum performance

- [00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=2799) and the speed. It is still starting. The first&nbsp; time start may be slow. You will also get this

- [00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=2804) error. This is not important. You can just&nbsp; ignore it and it also fixed it itself. The

- [00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=2810) model loadings, the start times on the RunPod&nbsp; is just terrible due to their disk speed. Okay,

- [00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=2816) we are seeing the Blackbell RTX Pro 6000&nbsp; GPU with 96 GB of VRAM. You can see the

- [00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=2824) total VRAM and the RAM of the machine here.&nbsp; We can see that it is using Sage Attention,

- [00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=2829) so it will be the fastest attention. Okay, we are&nbsp; still waiting for start. And when you see this, it

- [00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=2835) means that it is started on the 3000 port. How we&nbsp; are going to connect? Go back to your My Pods and

- [00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=2841) click this arrow icon and you see there is connect&nbsp; to port. Connect to port and connect by 3001 port.

- [00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=2850) And the ComfyUI is starting. This is running in&nbsp; the RunPod machine. So open a new terminal. We

- [00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=2857) want to watch the what is happening. pip install&nbsp; nvitop, then just type nvitop like this. Okay,

- [00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=2864) the machine is ready and set and the ComfyUI&nbsp; also started. So I'm going to drag and drop the

- [00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=2870) workflow from my extracted folder. Let's use the&nbsp; best performance workflow, which is here. You see

- [00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=2879) 720p long context high quality, drag and drop it.&nbsp; The rest of the usage is exactly same as in the

- [00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=2886) Windows tutorial part. So let's upload our demo&nbsp; images. This is the demo image. Let's upload our

- [00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=2893) test file. This is around 250 frames. So after&nbsp; uploading your image and audio, first of all,

- [00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=2901) set your width and height. Since this is a tall&nbsp; image, this is 720p and 1280p. It will auto

- [00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=2909) crop and resize it. This is 250 frames. So the&nbsp; parameters that you need to change is input image,

- [00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=2917) image size, input audio, number of frames. This&nbsp; is depending on your input audio length. 25 frames

- [00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=2925) means that it is one second of audio. Then the&nbsp; prompt. Nothing else you just need to change it.

- [00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=2932) So this is a man patiently singing like this. So&nbsp; I did set the prompt as well and I am pretty much

- [00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=2940) ready. All I need to also need to set is the&nbsp; blocks to swap. Currently, it is set to zero

- [00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=2947) because this machine has huge amount of VRAM. If&nbsp; the VRAM was low, you could set it as 40 and it

- [00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=2955) would run it on the CPU RAM. However, I am going&nbsp; to use as zero. This is a big machine. Moreover,

- [00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=2962) if you get out of VRAM error, you can enable all&nbsp; the tiling, tiled VAE, enable it if you get out of

- [00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=2969) VRAM. Then you will see enable VAE tiling, enable&nbsp; it if you get out of VRAM, and you will see enable

- [00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=2976) VAE tiling also here. Okay, I don't need to change&nbsp; them on this machine and I did set the block swap

- [00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=2983) to zero and then I need to hit run here. You&nbsp; see it is at the bottom, this one. Then let's

- [00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=2989) return back to machine and see what is happening.&nbsp; This is the GPU, it is loading the model. We can

- [00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=2995) also watch the status on the terminal where we&nbsp; started the ComfyUI. So between these two, you

- [00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=3000) need to check it out. It will show us everything.&nbsp; So you see it shows the total route duration of

- [00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=3005) the audio is 9.96 seconds. You need to get the&nbsp; audio second yourself. You need to calculate it,

- [00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=3012) unfortunately, to set the number of frames here.&nbsp; It is not automatically set. If you know how to

- [00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=3019) make it automatically set according to the number&nbsp; of seconds from here, I can update the workflows

- [00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=3025) later, but currently, we need to manually&nbsp; calculate the duration and therefore, the

- [00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=3031) calculate the number of frames we need. Okay, it&nbsp; is loading the models. Let's see what will happen.

- [00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=3036) The initial loading of the models may take&nbsp; huge time on RunPod. So you just need to wait

- [00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=3041) patiently. Moreover, you can follow always NVI&nbsp; top screen to see what is happening. You see,

- [00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=3048) I can see that the memory is increasing the RAM&nbsp; of the machine. Therefore, I can say that it is

- [00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=3055) loading model right now. Moreover, it is using&nbsp; CPU, therefore it is doing some operations.

- [00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=3059) Probably setting up the precision of the model&nbsp; while loading. And I can see that now it is

- [00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=3065) loading the transformer parameters to CPU, then it&nbsp; will move them into the GPU. Why it is happening?

- [00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=3071) Because we are using block swapping. You can&nbsp; right-click and bypass this if you want, if

- [00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=3076) you want to avoid that on a big VRAM machine GPU&nbsp; like this one. It also shows you other parameters.

- [00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=3082) You can always read here to understand and the&nbsp; processing is starting. Let's see how much VRAM

- [00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=3088) it will use. Okay, it is using 35 GB of VRAM right&nbsp; now. So this machine was an overkill for this,

- [00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=3097) but we will get maximum speed. Okay, it is using&nbsp; entire 600 watts. This is amazing. This means

- [00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=3104) that we are fully utilizing the GPU and it is&nbsp; processing as chunks. Meanwhile, it is changing

- [00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=3111) between chunks, you will see drop of the watt&nbsp; usage. So it processed the zero between 81 chunks,

- [00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=3118) then it is processing 52 between 181 because this&nbsp; model is normally able to process 81 chunks at

- [00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=3125) once. Therefore, it is splitting and it's also&nbsp; have some inter-crossing of the chunk so that

- [00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=3132) it will be consistent. And this is the first&nbsp; step. It will do 10 steps total because this

- [00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=3137) is high quality processing and we did set 250&nbsp; frames. You can also see this as the frames.

- [00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=3144) Okay, so it has been generated&nbsp; and let's see the result.

- [00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=3149) Through the maze where the data play. Amazing result as in the previous part

- [00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=3154) of the tutorial. So how you can download&nbsp; this? Right-click and save preview and it

- [00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=3159) will download it into your computer. Moreover,&nbsp; you can go to your ComfyUI in workspace, output,

- [00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=3165) and you can right-click and download from here&nbsp; like this, download, download, or if you want to

- [00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=3171) download entire generations, go to the ComfyUI and&nbsp; right-click output and download as an archive. It

- [00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=3178) will zip the entire folder and it will let you&nbsp; download all the files like this. So what else

- [00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=3184) left? Let me show you how to stop and start this&nbsp; machine another time. So currently, I am using

- [00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=3192) 2.79 dollars per hour. Let's stop this. This will&nbsp; only cost me 0.56 dollar per hour. So it will cost

- [00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=3201) me only 1.33 dollar per day if I stop this pod.&nbsp; Then I can resume it whenever I want. So I will

- [00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=3209) just click start and there must be a GPU, so start&nbsp; it. Let's wait for it to start. So this is the

- [00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=3216) biggest advantage of RunPod. As I said, you don't&nbsp; need to reinstall everything from scratch. We will

- [00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=3222) be able to just start and use the application.&nbsp; However, if there were no GPU at the time when

- [00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=3229) I am starting again, I wouldn't be able to use.&nbsp; And to prevent that, you can use the storage

- [00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=3235) and network volume, permanent volume storage&nbsp; from here. Okay, the machine started. Let's

- [00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=3241) connect from the Jupyter Lab. I will just open the&nbsp; RunPod instructions here and I will just copy this

- [00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=3249) starting command from here. So new terminal, wait&nbsp; for terminal to start. Sometimes the terminal may

- [00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=3255) not open. This is because of the browser. You can&nbsp; restart your browser to fix. Okay, copy, paste it.

- [00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=3261) Now it will start the application and I will be&nbsp; directly use it right away. Okay, it is starting.

- [00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=3268) You see the restart is pretty fast compared to the&nbsp; of course installation. Moreover, pay attention to

- [00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=3274) how much volume you are using. We are using like&nbsp; 50% of our volume. If we get out of disk space,

- [00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=3280) we have to stop and expand the storage. Okay, we&nbsp; need to see the local host URL started here. It

- [00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=3287) is still not yet. Almost there. It is starting.&nbsp; If you want to update your ComfyUI, then you just

- [00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=3294) need to run the installation command again. It&nbsp; will update it very quickly without installing

- [00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=3301) entirely. Okay, the application almost started,&nbsp; still not. We are waiting for URL to appear here.

- [00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=3308) Okay, here. So it started. Now I will go back to&nbsp; my pods, connect, HTTP servers 3001. It's still

- [00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=3316) not ready yet, probably. Yes, now it's ready and&nbsp; the ComfyUI will start like before. So this is

- [00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=3323) the way of using RunPod. Yes, it started. It is&nbsp; keeping everything as it is. Now I can stop this

- [00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=3330) so it will not charge me a lot of money. If&nbsp; you want to prevent any money usage, then you

- [00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=3337) need to click terminate and it will terminate the&nbsp; machine entirely. So you will be not spending any

- [00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=3344) money on it. That's it. I hope you have enjoyed.&nbsp; Please reply this video, share it, comment. You

- [00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cMIwS9qo4M&t=3350) can ask me any questions you want. Hopefully,&nbsp; see you in future amazing tutorial video.
