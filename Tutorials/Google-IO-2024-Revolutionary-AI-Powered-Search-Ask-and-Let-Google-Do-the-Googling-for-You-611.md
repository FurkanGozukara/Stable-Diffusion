In the sixth part of the Google I/O 2024 event, Liz and Rose unveiled the groundbreaking advancements in Google Search powered by generative AI. With the introduction of the custom Gemini model, Google Search is now capable of doing more for users than ever before. The Gemini model combines Google's real-time information, unparalleled ranking and quality systems, and the power of Gemini to unlock a new era of search capabilities.

One of the key features highlighted was AI overviews, which provide instant answers to user questions, complete with a range of perspectives and links to dive deeper. AI overviews will be rolling out to everyone in the US starting today and will be available to over a billion people by the end of the year.

Google also introduced multi-step reasoning in Search, allowing users to ask complex questions with multiple sub-questions and receive an AI overview in seconds. The Gemini model acts as an AI agent, breaking down bigger questions into parts, figuring out which problems need to be solved, and in what order. It reasons using the highest quality information available, tapping into Google's extensive index of real-world information.

The presenters also demonstrated how Google Search can assist with planning, from meal plans to trips, parties, and more. The Gemini model uses advanced reasoning and logic to create customized plans based on user preferences, making planning hassle-free.

Another exciting feature is the AI-organized search results page, custom-built for users' questions. When searching for inspiration, such as finding the perfect restaurant for an anniversary, Google Search uncovers interesting angles to explore and organizes the results into helpful clusters. The model even considers contextual factors, like the time of year, to provide relevant suggestions.

Rose gave a live demo showcasing the ability to ask questions with video in Google Search. Using state-of-the-art speech models, deep visual understanding, and the custom Gemini model, Search can understand questions asked out loud, break down videos frame by frame, and provide AI overviews with relevant insights from various sources across the web.

Liz concluded by emphasizing that these advancements are just a glimpse of how Google is reimagining search in the Gemini era. By combining the best of what makes Google Search trusted by billions with the power of Gemini's agent of capabilities, users can now rely on Google to do the searching, researching, planning, and brainstorming for them. These features will be rolling out in the coming weeks, and users can opt into Search Labs to be among the first to try them out.

The future of search is here, and Google is leading the way with its AI-powered innovations, making it easier than ever for users to find the information they need by simply asking.

- [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4f_iB_hF5w&t=0) Okay, we continue with the part 6 of the Google I.O. 2024 event.

- [00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4f_iB_hF5w&t=11) Thanks Sundar with each of these platform shifts.

- [00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4f_iB_hF5w&t=15) We haven't just adapted.

- [00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4f_iB_hF5w&t=17) We've expanded what's possible with Google search.

- [00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4f_iB_hF5w&t=21) And now with generative AI search will do more for you than you ever imagined.

- [00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4f_iB_hF5w&t=27) So whatever is on your mind,

- [00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4f_iB_hF5w&t=29) whatever you need to get done.

- [00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4f_iB_hF5w&t=31) Just ask and Google will do the googling for you.

- [00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4f_iB_hF5w&t=37) All the advancements.

- [00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4f_iB_hF5w&t=38) You'll see today are made possible by a new Gemini model customized for Google search.

- [00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4f_iB_hF5w&t=44) What really sets this apart is our three unique strengths.

- [00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4f_iB_hF5w&t=48) First our real-time information with over a trillion facts about people places and things.

- [00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4f_iB_hF5w&t=56) Second are unparalleled ranking and quality systems trusted for decades to get you the very best of the web.

- [00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4f_iB_hF5w&t=63) And third the power of Gemini which unlocks new agent of capabilities right in search.

- [00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4f_iB_hF5w&t=71) By bringing these three things all together,

- [00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4f_iB_hF5w&t=73) we're able to dramatically expand what's possible with Google search yet again.

- [00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4f_iB_hF5w&t=79) This is search in the Gemini era.

- [00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4f_iB_hF5w&t=82) So let's dig in.

- [00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4f_iB_hF5w&t=83) You've heard today about AI overviews and how helpful people are finding them.

- [00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4f_iB_hF5w&t=88) With AI overviews, Google does the work for you.

- [00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4f_iB_hF5w&t=92) Instead of piecing together all the information yourself, you can ask your question.

- [00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4f_iB_hF5w&t=98) And as you see here, you can get an answer instantly.

- [00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4f_iB_hF5w&t=102) Complete with a range of perspectives and links to dive deeper.

- [00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4f_iB_hF5w&t=107) As Sundar shared, AI overviews will begin rolling out to everyone in the US starting today.

- [00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4f_iB_hF5w&t=113) With more countries soon.

- [00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4f_iB_hF5w&t=115) And by the end of the year AI overviews will come to over a billion people in Google search.

- [00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4f_iB_hF5w&t=122) But this is just the first step.

- [00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4f_iB_hF5w&t=125) We're making AI overviews even more helpful for your most complex questions.

- [00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4f_iB_hF5w&t=129) The type that are really more like 10 questions in one.

- [00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4f_iB_hF5w&t=133) You can ask your entire question with all its sub-questions and get an AI overview in seconds.

- [00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4f_iB_hF5w&t=140) To make this possible, we're introducing multi-step reasoning in Google search.

- [00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4f_iB_hF5w&t=145) So Google can do the researching for you.

- [00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4f_iB_hF5w&t=149) For example, let's say you've been trying to get into yoga and Pilates.

- [00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4f_iB_hF5w&t=153) Finding the right studio can take a lot of research.

- [00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4f_iB_hF5w&t=156) There's so many factors you need to consider.

- [00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4f_iB_hF5w&t=160) Soon you'll be able to ask search to find the best yoga or Pilates studios in Boston.

- [00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4f_iB_hF5w&t=165) And show you details on their intro offers and the walking time from Beacon Hill.

- [00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4f_iB_hF5w&t=170) As you can see here, Google gets to work for you.

- [00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4f_iB_hF5w&t=174) Finding the most relevant information and bringing it together into your AI overview.

- [00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4f_iB_hF5w&t=179) You get some studios with great ratings and their introductory offers.

- [00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4f_iB_hF5w&t=183) And you can see the distance for each.

- [00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4f_iB_hF5w&t=185) Like this one, it's just a 10 minute walk away.

- [00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4f_iB_hF5w&t=188) Right below you see where they're located, laid out visually.

- [00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4f_iB_hF5w&t=192) And you've got all this from just a single search.

- [00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4f_iB_hF5w&t=195) Under the hood, our custom Gemini model acts as your AI agent using what we call multi-step reasoning.

- [00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4f_iB_hF5w&t=203) It breaks your bigger question down into all its parts.

- [00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4f_iB_hF5w&t=206) And it figures out which problems it needs to solve and in what order.

- [00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4f_iB_hF5w&t=211) And thanks to our real-time info and ranking expertise,

- [00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4f_iB_hF5w&t=215) it reasons using the highest quality information out there.

- [00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4f_iB_hF5w&t=219) So since you're asking about places, it taps into Google's index of information about the real world.

- [00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4f_iB_hF5w&t=225) With over 250 million places and updated in real-time.

- [00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4f_iB_hF5w&t=230) Including their ratings, reviews, business hours, and more.

- [00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4f_iB_hF5w&t=236) Research that might have taken you minutes or even hours,

- [00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4f_iB_hF5w&t=240) Google can now do on your behalf in just seconds.

- [00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4f_iB_hF5w&t=243) Next, let me show you another way multi-step reasoning in Google search can make your life that much easier.

- [00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4f_iB_hF5w&t=249) Take planning for example.

- [00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4f_iB_hF5w&t=251) Dreaming of trips and meal plans can be fun,

- [00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4f_iB_hF5w&t=253) but doing the work of actually figuring it all out?

- [00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4f_iB_hF5w&t=256) No thank you.

- [00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4f_iB_hF5w&t=258) With Gemini and Search, Google does the planning with you.

- [00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4f_iB_hF5w&t=262) Planning is really hard for AI to get right.

- [00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4f_iB_hF5w&t=265) It's the type of problem that takes advanced reasoning and logic.

- [00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4f_iB_hF5w&t=268) After all, if you're meal planning, you probably don't want mac and cheese for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.

- [00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4f_iB_hF5w&t=276) Okay, my kids might, but say you're looking for a bit more variety.

- [00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4f_iB_hF5w&t=282) Now you can ask search to create a three-day meal plan for a group that's easy to prepare.

- [00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4f_iB_hF5w&t=287) And here you get a plan with a wide range of recipes from across the web.

- [00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4f_iB_hF5w&t=291) This one for overnight oats looks particularly interesting.

- [00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4f_iB_hF5w&t=295) And you can easily head over to the website to learn how to prepare them.

- [00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4f_iB_hF5w&t=300) If you want to get more veggies in, you can simply ask search to swap in a vegetarian dish.

- [00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4f_iB_hF5w&t=305) And just like that, search customizes your meal plan.

- [00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4f_iB_hF5w&t=309) And you can export your meal plan or get the ingredients as a list just by tapping here.

- [00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4f_iB_hF5w&t=314) Looking ahead, you can imagine asking Google to add everything to your preferred shopping cart.

- [00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4f_iB_hF5w&t=320) Then we're really cooking.

- [00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4f_iB_hF5w&t=323) These planning capabilities mean search will be able to help plan everything from meals and trips,

- [00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4f_iB_hF5w&t=329) to parties, dates, workout routines, and more.

- [00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4f_iB_hF5w&t=333) So you can get all the fun of planning without any of the hassle.

- [00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4f_iB_hF5w&t=336) You've seen how Google search can help with increasingly complex questions and planning.

- [00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4f_iB_hF5w&t=342) But what about all those times when you don't know exactly what to ask,

- [00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4f_iB_hF5w&t=345) and you need some help brainstorming?

- [00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4f_iB_hF5w&t=348) When you come to search for ideas, you'll get more than an AI-generated answer.

- [00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4f_iB_hF5w&t=352) You'll get an entire AI-organized page, custom-built for you and your kids.

- [00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4f_iB_hF5w&t=358) And you'll learn how to plan.

- [00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4f_iB_hF5w&t=361) You'll get an entire AI-organized page, custom-built for you and your question.

- [00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4f_iB_hF5w&t=368) Say you're heading to Dallas to celebrate your anniversary, and you're looking for the perfect restaurant.

- [00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4f_iB_hF5w&t=374) What you get here breaks AI out of the box, and it brings it to the whole page.

- [00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4f_iB_hF5w&t=380) Our Gemini model uncovers the most interesting angles for you to explore,

- [00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4f_iB_hF5w&t=384) and organizes these results into these helpful clusters.

- [00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4f_iB_hF5w&t=388) Like you might never have considered restaurants with live music, or ones with historic charm.

- [00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4f_iB_hF5w&t=395) Our model even uses contextual factors, like the time of the year.

- [00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4f_iB_hF5w&t=399) So since it's warm in Dallas, you can get rooftop patios as an idea.

- [00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4f_iB_hF5w&t=404) And it pulls everything together into a dynamic whole-page experience.

- [00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4f_iB_hF5w&t=409) You'll start to see this new AI-organized search results page when you look for inspiration,

- [00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4f_iB_hF5w&t=415) starting with dining and recipes, and coming to movies, music, books, hotels, shopping, and more.

- [00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4f_iB_hF5w&t=431) Today you've seen how you can bring any question to search, and Google takes the work out of searching.

- [00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4f_iB_hF5w&t=437) But your questions aren't limited to words in a text box, and sometimes even that picture can't tell the whole story.

- [00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4f_iB_hF5w&t=444) Earlier demos showed you our latest advancements in video understanding.

- [00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4f_iB_hF5w&t=449) And I'm really excited to share that soon you'll be able to ask questions with video, right in Google Search.

- [00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4f_iB_hF5w&t=456) Let me introduce Rose to show you this in a live demo.

- [00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4f_iB_hF5w&t=467) Thank you, Liz.

- [00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4f_iB_hF5w&t=469) I have always run a record player, and I got this one and some vinyls at Yarsel recently.

- [00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4f_iB_hF5w&t=475) But when I go to play it, this thing keeps sliding off.

- [00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4f_iB_hF5w&t=480) I have no idea how to fix it, or where to even start.

- [00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4f_iB_hF5w&t=484) Before, I would have pieced together a bunch of searches to try to figure this out.

- [00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4f_iB_hF5w&t=489) Like, what make is this record player? What's the model? And what is this thing actually called?

- [00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4f_iB_hF5w&t=494) But now I can just ask of a video.

- [00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4f_iB_hF5w&t=498) So let's try it. Let's do a live demo.

- [00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4f_iB_hF5w&t=501) I'm going to take a video and ask Google, why will this not stay in place?

- [00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4f_iB_hF5w&t=509) And in a near instant, Google gives me an AI overview.

- [00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4f_iB_hF5w&t=514) I guess some reasons this might be happening, and steps I can take to troubleshoot.

- [00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4f_iB_hF5w&t=518) So it looks like first, this is called a Tonger. Very helpful.

- [00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4f_iB_hF5w&t=524) And it looks like it may be unbalanced, and there's some really helpful steps here.

- [00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4f_iB_hF5w&t=528) And I love that, because I'm new to all this, I can check out this helpful link from Audio Technica to learn even more.

- [00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4f_iB_hF5w&t=535) So that was pretty quick.

- [00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4f_iB_hF5w&t=543) Let me walk you through what just happened.

- [00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4f_iB_hF5w&t=545) Thanks to a combination of our state-of-the-art speech models, our deep visual understanding, and our custom Gemini model,

- [00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4f_iB_hF5w&t=553) Search was able to understand the question I asked out loud, break down the video frame by frame.

- [00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4f_iB_hF5w&t=559) Each frame was fed into Gemini's long context window you heard about earlier today.

- [00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4f_iB_hF5w&t=564) Search could then pinpoint the exact make and model of my record player,

- [00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4f_iB_hF5w&t=570) and make sense of the motion across frames to identify the tone arm was drifting.

- [00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4f_iB_hF5w&t=573) Search fanned out and combed the web to find relevant insights from articles, forums, videos, and more.

- [00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4f_iB_hF5w&t=582) And it stitched all of this together into my AI overview.

- [00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4f_iB_hF5w&t=586) The result was music to my ears. Back to you, Liz.

- [00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4f_iB_hF5w&t=597) Everything you saw today is just a glimpse of how we're reimagining Google Search.

- [00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4f_iB_hF5w&t=603) In the Gemini era, we're taking the very best of what makes Google Google.

- [00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4f_iB_hF5w&t=608) All the reasons why billions of people turn to Google Search and have relied on us for decades.

- [00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4f_iB_hF5w&t=615) And we're bringing in the power of Gemini's agent of capabilities.

- [00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4f_iB_hF5w&t=619) So Google will do the searching, the researching, the planning, the brainstorming, and so much more.

- [00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4f_iB_hF5w&t=627) All you need to do is just ask.

- [00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4f_iB_hF5w&t=631) You'll start to see these features rolling out in Search in the coming weeks.

- [00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4f_iB_hF5w&t=636) Opt in to Search Labs to be among the first to try them out.

- [00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4f_iB_hF5w&t=640) Now let's take a look at how this all comes together in Google Search.
