### Video Transcription


- [00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0MOGCyb_Ns&t=4) Thanks, Aparna. It's exciting to see all&nbsp; the innovation coming to Google Workspace.&nbsp;

- [00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0MOGCyb_Ns&t=11) As AI continues to improve rapidly, we are&nbsp; focused on giving helpful features to our users.&nbsp;

- [00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0MOGCyb_Ns&t=17) And starting today, we are giving&nbsp; you a new way to preview some of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0MOGCyb_Ns&t=21) experiences across Workspace and other products. It's called Labs. I say new, but Google has a&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0MOGCyb_Ns&t=30) long history of bringing Labs and we've made&nbsp; it available throughout our history as well.&nbsp;

- [00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0MOGCyb_Ns&t=37) You can check it out at Google.com slash Labs. Next up, we're going to talk about Search.&nbsp;

- [00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0MOGCyb_Ns&t=46) Search has been our founding&nbsp; product from our earliest days.&nbsp;

- [00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0MOGCyb_Ns&t=52) And we've always approached it placing&nbsp; user trust about everything else.&nbsp;

- [00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0MOGCyb_Ns&t=60) To give you a sense of how we are&nbsp; bringing generative AI in Search,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0MOGCyb_Ns&t=64) I'm going to invite Kathy onto the stage. Kathy.&nbsp;

- [00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0MOGCyb_Ns&t=87) Thanks, Sundar.&nbsp;

- [00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0MOGCyb_Ns&t=88) You know, I've been working&nbsp; in Search for many years.&nbsp;

- [00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0MOGCyb_Ns&t=92) And what inspires me so much is how it&nbsp; continues to be an unsolved problem.&nbsp;

- [00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0MOGCyb_Ns&t=99) And that's why I'm just so excited by the&nbsp; potential of bringing generative AI into Search.&nbsp;

- [00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0MOGCyb_Ns&t=106) Let's give it a whirl. So let's start with a&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0MOGCyb_Ns&t=111) search for what's better for a family with kids&nbsp; under three and a dog, Bryce Canyon or Arches?&nbsp;

- [00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0MOGCyb_Ns&t=120) Now, although this is the question that you have,&nbsp; you probably wouldn't ask it in this way today.&nbsp;

- [00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0MOGCyb_Ns&t=128) You'd break it down into smaller&nbsp; ones, sift through the information&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0MOGCyb_Ns&t=132) and then piece things together yourself. Now, Search does the heavy lifting for you.&nbsp;

- [00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0MOGCyb_Ns&t=141) What you see here looks pretty different. So let me first give you a quick tour.&nbsp;

- [00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0MOGCyb_Ns&t=147) You'll notice a new integrated search results page&nbsp; so you can get even more out of a single search.&nbsp;

- [00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0MOGCyb_Ns&t=155) There's an AI powered snapshot that quickly&nbsp; gives you the lay of the land on a topic.&nbsp;

- [00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0MOGCyb_Ns&t=161) And so here you can see that&nbsp; while both parks are kid friendly,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0MOGCyb_Ns&t=165) only Bryce Canyon has more&nbsp; options for your furry friend.&nbsp;

- [00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0MOGCyb_Ns&t=171) Then if you want to dig deeper, there&nbsp; are links included in the snapshot.&nbsp;

- [00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0MOGCyb_Ns&t=176) You can also click to expand your view and&nbsp; you'll see how the information is corroborated.&nbsp;

- [00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0MOGCyb_Ns&t=182) So you can check out more details and&nbsp; really explore the richness of the topic.&nbsp;

- [00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0MOGCyb_Ns&t=189) This new experience builds on&nbsp; Google's ranking and safety systems&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0MOGCyb_Ns&t=194) that we've been fine tuning for decades. And search will continue to be your jumping&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0MOGCyb_Ns&t=201) off point to what makes the web so special. It's diverse range of content from publishers&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0MOGCyb_Ns&t=208) to creators, businesses and&nbsp; even people like you and me.&nbsp;

- [00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0MOGCyb_Ns&t=214) So you can check out recommendations from&nbsp; experts like the National Park Service&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0MOGCyb_Ns&t=219) and learn from authentic firsthand&nbsp; experiences like the mom Trotter blog.&nbsp;

- [00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0MOGCyb_Ns&t=226) Because even in a world where AI can&nbsp; provide insights, we know that people&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0MOGCyb_Ns&t=232) will always value the input of other people. And a thriving web is essential to that.&nbsp;

- [00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0MOGCyb_Ns&t=241) These new generative AI&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0MOGCyb_Ns&t=253) capabilities will make search&nbsp; smarter and searching simpler.&nbsp;

- [00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0MOGCyb_Ns&t=257) And as you've seen, this is really&nbsp; especially helpful when you need to&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0MOGCyb_Ns&t=261) make sense of something complex&nbsp; with multiple angles to explore.&nbsp;

- [00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0MOGCyb_Ns&t=265) You know, those times when even&nbsp; your question has questions.&nbsp;

- [00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0MOGCyb_Ns&t=270) So, for example, let's say you're searching for&nbsp; a good bike for a five mile commute with hills.&nbsp;

- [00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0MOGCyb_Ns&t=277) This can be a big purchase. So you want to do your research.&nbsp;

- [00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0MOGCyb_Ns&t=281) In the AI powered snapshot, you'll see&nbsp; important considerations like motor&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0MOGCyb_Ns&t=287) and battery for taking on those hills&nbsp; and suspension for a comfortable ride.&nbsp;

- [00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0MOGCyb_Ns&t=293) Right below that, you'll see products that&nbsp; fit the bill, each with images, reviews,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0MOGCyb_Ns&t=298) helpful descriptions and current pricing. This is built on Google's shopping graph, the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0MOGCyb_Ns&t=306) world's most comprehensive data set of constantly&nbsp; changing products, sellers, brands, reviews and&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0MOGCyb_Ns&t=314) inventory out there with over 35 billion listings. In fact, there are 1.8 billion live updates to&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0MOGCyb_Ns&t=324) our shopping graph every hour. So you can shop with confidence&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0MOGCyb_Ns&t=328) in this new experience, knowing that&nbsp; you'll get fresh, relevant results.&nbsp;

- [00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0MOGCyb_Ns&t=335) And for commercial queries like this, we&nbsp; also know that ads can be especially helpful&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0MOGCyb_Ns&t=341) to connect people with useful information&nbsp; and help businesses get discovered online.&nbsp;

- [00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0MOGCyb_Ns&t=348) They're here, clearly labeled, and we're&nbsp; exploring different ways to integrate them&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0MOGCyb_Ns&t=352) as we roll out new experiences in search. And now that you've done some research,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0MOGCyb_Ns&t=359) you might want to explore more. So right under the snapshot,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0MOGCyb_Ns&t=363) you'll see the option to ask a follow up&nbsp; question or select a suggested next step.&nbsp;

- [00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0MOGCyb_Ns&t=371) Tapping any of these options will bring&nbsp; you into our brand new conversational mode.&nbsp;

- [00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0MOGCyb_Ns&t=380) In this case, maybe you want to&nbsp; ask a follow up about e-bikes,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0MOGCyb_Ns&t=388) so you look for one in your favorite color, red. And without having to go back to square one,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0MOGCyb_Ns&t=395) Google Search understands your full intent&nbsp; and that you're looking specifically for&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0MOGCyb_Ns&t=400) e-bikes in red that would be good&nbsp; for a five mile commute with hills.&nbsp;

- [00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0MOGCyb_Ns&t=406) And even when you're in this conversational&nbsp; mode, it's an integrated experience.&nbsp;

- [00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0MOGCyb_Ns&t=410) So you can simply scroll to&nbsp; see other search results.&nbsp;

- [00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0MOGCyb_Ns&t=415) Now, maybe this e-bike seems to&nbsp; be a good fit for your commute.&nbsp;

- [00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0MOGCyb_Ns&t=420) With just a click, you're able to&nbsp; see a variety of retailers that&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0MOGCyb_Ns&t=423) have it in stock and some that&nbsp; offer free delivery or returns.&nbsp;

- [00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0MOGCyb_Ns&t=429) You'll also see current prices, including&nbsp; deals, and can seamlessly go to a merchant site,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0MOGCyb_Ns&t=435) check out and turn your attention to what&nbsp; really matters, getting ready to ride.&nbsp;

- [00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0MOGCyb_Ns&t=443) These new generative AI capabilities also unlock&nbsp; a whole new category of experiences on search.&nbsp;

- [00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0MOGCyb_Ns&t=451) It could help you create a clever name for&nbsp; your cycling club, craft the perfect social&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0MOGCyb_Ns&t=457) post to show off your new wheels, or even&nbsp; test your knowledge on bicycle hand signals.&nbsp;

- [00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0MOGCyb_Ns&t=465) These are things you may never have&nbsp; thought to ask search for before.&nbsp;

- [00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0MOGCyb_Ns&t=471) Shopping is just one example&nbsp; of where this can be helpful.&nbsp;

- [00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0MOGCyb_Ns&t=474) Let's walk through another one in a live demo.&nbsp;

- [00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0MOGCyb_Ns&t=477) What do you say? Yeah.&nbsp;

- [00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0MOGCyb_Ns&t=483) So special shout out to my three year&nbsp; old daughter who is obsessed with whales.&nbsp;

- [00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0MOGCyb_Ns&t=490) I wanted to teach her about whale song. So let me go to the Google app and ask,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0MOGCyb_Ns&t=496) why do whales like to sing?&nbsp;

- [00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0MOGCyb_Ns&t=500) And so here I see a snapshot that&nbsp; organizes the web results and gets&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0MOGCyb_Ns&t=505) me to key things I want to know. So I can understand quickly that,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0MOGCyb_Ns&t=511) oh, they sing for a lot of different&nbsp; reasons, like to communicate with&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0MOGCyb_Ns&t=515) other whales, but also to find food. And I can click see more to expand here as well.&nbsp;

- [00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0MOGCyb_Ns&t=522) Now, if I was actually with my daughter and not&nbsp; on stage in front of thousands of people, I'd be&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0MOGCyb_Ns&t=527) checking out some of these web results right now. They look pretty good.&nbsp;

- [00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0MOGCyb_Ns&t=531) Now, I'm thinking she'd get a&nbsp; kick out of seeing one up close.&nbsp;

- [00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0MOGCyb_Ns&t=535) So let me ask. Can I see whales in California?&nbsp;

- [00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0MOGCyb_Ns&t=548) And so the LLMs right now are working&nbsp; behind the scenes to generate my&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0MOGCyb_Ns&t=553) snapshot, distilling insights and&nbsp; perspectives from across the web.&nbsp;

- [00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0MOGCyb_Ns&t=559) It looks like in Northern California, I&nbsp; can see humpbacks around this time of year.&nbsp;

- [00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0MOGCyb_Ns&t=564) That's cool. I'll have to plan to take her on a trip soon.&nbsp;

- [00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0MOGCyb_Ns&t=569) And again, I can see some really&nbsp; great results from across the web.&nbsp;

- [00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0MOGCyb_Ns&t=574) And if I want to refer to the results of my&nbsp; previous question, I can just scroll right up.&nbsp;

- [00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0MOGCyb_Ns&t=581) Now, she's got a birthday coming up, so I can&nbsp; follow up with plush ones for kids under $40.&nbsp;

- [00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0MOGCyb_Ns&t=594) Again, the LLMs are organizing&nbsp; this information for me,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0MOGCyb_Ns&t=598) and this process will get faster over time.&nbsp;

- [00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0MOGCyb_Ns&t=603) These seem like some great options. I think she'll really like the second one.&nbsp;

- [00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0MOGCyb_Ns&t=608) She's into orcas as well. Phew,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0MOGCyb_Ns&t=611) live demos are always a little nerve wracking. I'm really glad that one went whale.&nbsp;

- [00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0MOGCyb_Ns&t=625) What you've seen today is just a first look at how&nbsp; we're experimenting with generative AI in search.&nbsp;

- [00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0MOGCyb_Ns&t=633) And we're excited to keep improving with your&nbsp; feedback through our search labs program.&nbsp;

- [00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0MOGCyb_Ns&t=640) This new search generative experience,&nbsp; also known as SGE, will be available&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0MOGCyb_Ns&t=647) in labs along with some other experiments. And they'll be rolling out in the coming weeks.&nbsp;

- [00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0MOGCyb_Ns&t=654) If you're in the U.S., you can join&nbsp; the wait list today by tapping the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0MOGCyb_Ns&t=659) labs icon in the latest version of&nbsp; the Google app or Chrome desktop.&nbsp;

- [00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0MOGCyb_Ns&t=665) This new experience really reflects&nbsp; the beginning of a new chapter.&nbsp;

- [00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0MOGCyb_Ns&t=671) And you can think of this&nbsp; evolution as search supercharged.
