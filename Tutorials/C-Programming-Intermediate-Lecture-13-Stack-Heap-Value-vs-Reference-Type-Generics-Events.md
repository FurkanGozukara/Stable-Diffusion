Introduction:

C# is a modern, object-oriented programming language that is used to build a variety of applications ranging from desktop applications to web-based applications. When writing code in C#, it is essential to have an understanding of how the language manages memory and data types. In this article, we will discuss various concepts related to memory management, data types, and other advanced features in C#.

Heap and Stack:

In C#, there are two primary memory regions: the heap and the stack. The stack is a region of memory that is used to store value types, method calls, and function parameters. It is a first-in, last-out (FILO) data structure that allocates memory in a continuous block. The stack is faster than the heap because of its memory allocation method.

On the other hand, the heap is a region of memory that is used to store reference types, objects, and arrays. It is a more flexible data structure that allows memory to be allocated and released in any order. The heap is slower than the stack because of its memory allocation and deallocation process.

Difference between Stack and Heap:

The main difference between the stack and the heap is how they allocate and release memory. The stack allocates memory in a continuous block, while the heap allocates memory randomly. The stack is more efficient in terms of memory allocation and deallocation, while the heap is more flexible.

Types of Things in Stack and Heap:

Value types such as int, bool, char, and float are stored on the stack. They are allocated on the stack when declared, and their memory is deallocated when they go out of scope.

Reference types such as classes, arrays, and objects are stored on the heap. When a reference type is declared, a reference to the object is created on the stack, and the object itself is stored on the heap.

Enumerations or enums are value types that can be used to define a set of named constants. They are stored on the stack.

Pointers or references are variables that hold the memory address of another variable.

- [00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=26) the udemy courses coverings that i could find for c

- [00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=30) coverings that i could find for c programming language and we even

- [00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=33) programming language and we even we are even teaching

- [00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=36) we are even teaching more of the udemy courses some of the

- [00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=38) more of the udemy courses some of the topics we cover here

- [00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=39) topics we cover here is not even listed on udemy

- [00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=43) is not even listed on udemy courses so this week i am composing a

- [00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=46) courses so this week i am composing a console application with

- [00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=48) console application with net core

- [00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=56) okay so let's pick our repository

- [00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=71) okay.net core 5 current

- [00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=77) okay so let's start with hash tables text and quiz

- [00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=97) introduction even though with the.net framework we don't have to actively

- [00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=99) framework we don't have to actively worry about memory management and

- [00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=101) worry about memory management and garbage collection

- [00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=102) garbage collection gc we still have to keep memory

- [00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=104) gc we still have to keep memory management and gc in mind in order to

- [00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=106) management and gc in mind in order to optimize the performance of our

- [00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=108) optimize the performance of our applications

- [00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=109) applications also having a basic understanding of how

- [00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=112) also having a basic understanding of how memory management works will help

- [00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=113) memory management works will help explain the behavior of the variables we

- [00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=115) explain the behavior of the variables we work with in every program we write

- [00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=118) work with in every program we write in this article i'll cover the basics of

- [00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=120) in this article i'll cover the basics of the stack and heap types of variables

- [00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=122) the stack and heap types of variables and why some variables work as they do

- [00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=126) and why some variables work as they do there are two places the dot-net

- [00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=128) there are two places the dot-net framework stores items in memory as your

- [00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=130) framework stores items in memory as your code executes

- [00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=132) code executes if you haven't already met let me

- [00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=133) if you haven't already met let me introduce you to the stack and the heap

- [00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=136) introduce you to the stack and the heap both the stack and heap help us run our

- [00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=138) both the stack and heap help us run our code

- [00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=139) code they reside in the operating memory on

- [00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=141) they reside in the operating memory on our machine and contain the pieces of

- [00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=143) our machine and contain the pieces of information we need to make it all

- [00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=145) information we need to make it all happen

- [00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=146) happen stack versus heap what's the difference

- [00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=150) stack versus heap what's the difference the stack is more or less responsible

- [00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=152) the stack is more or less responsible for keeping track of what's executing in

- [00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=154) for keeping track of what's executing in our code

- [00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=154) our code or what's been called the heap is more

- [00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=157) or what's been called the heap is more or less responsible for keeping track of

- [00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=159) or less responsible for keeping track of our objects

- [00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=160) our objects our data well most of it will get to

- [00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=162) our data well most of it will get to that later

- [00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=163) that later okay so the main difference is in this

- [00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=165) okay so the main difference is in this attack

- [00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=167) attack what is executing is halt like

- [00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=170) what is executing is halt like the methods we make method calls

- [00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=173) the methods we make method calls or returning from calls

- [00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=177) or returning from calls events or such so it is about keeping

- [00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=180) events or such so it is about keeping track

- [00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=182) track of what is executing and here is where

- [00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=186) of what is executing and here is where the bigger objects

- [00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=187) the bigger objects is save it like our uh instance of

- [00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=190) is save it like our uh instance of classes

- [00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=192) classes and uh like uh lists

- [00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=195) and uh like uh lists dictionaries and such

- [00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=202) think of the stack as a series of boxes stacked one on top of the next

- [00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=205) stacked one on top of the next we keep track of what's going on in our

- [00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=207) we keep track of what's going on in our application by stacking another box on

- [00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=209) application by stacking another box on top every time we call a method

- [00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=211) top every time we call a method called a frame we can only use what's in

- [00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=213) called a frame we can only use what's in the top box on the stack

- [00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=216) the top box on the stack when we're done with the top box the

- [00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=217) when we're done with the top box the method is done executing

- [00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=219) method is done executing we throw it away and proceed to use the

- [00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=221) we throw it away and proceed to use the stuff in the previous box on the top of

- [00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=223) stuff in the previous box on the top of the stack

- [00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=224) the stack the heap is similar except that its

- [00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=226) the heap is similar except that its purpose is to hold information

- [00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=228) purpose is to hold information not keep track of execution most of the

- [00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=230) not keep track of execution most of the time so anything in our heat can be

- [00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=232) time so anything in our heat can be accessed at any time

- [00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=234) accessed at any time with the heap there are no constraints

- [00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=236) with the heap there are no constraints as to what can be accessed like in the

- [00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=238) as to what can be accessed like in the stack

- [00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=239) stack the heap is like the heap of clean

- [00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=240) the heap is like the heap of clean laundry on our bed that we have not

- [00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=242) laundry on our bed that we have not taken the time to put away yet we can

- [00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=244) taken the time to put away yet we can grab what we need quickly

- [00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=246) grab what we need quickly the stack is like the stack of shoe

- [00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=248) the stack is like the stack of shoe boxes in the closet where we have to

- [00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=249) boxes in the closet where we have to take off the top one to get to the one

- [00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=251) take off the top one to get to the one underneath it

- [00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=252) underneath it so stick is first in first out

- [00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=256) so stick is first in first out and heap is whenever in whenever out

- [00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=263) okay so this is like stack and this is like heap

- [00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=268) like heap the picture above while not really a

- [00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=270) the picture above while not really a true representation of what's happening

- [00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=272) true representation of what's happening in memory

- [00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=272) in memory helps us distinguish a stack from a heap

- [00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=276) helps us distinguish a stack from a heap the stack is self-maintaining meaning

- [00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=278) the stack is self-maintaining meaning that it basically takes care of its own

- [00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=280) that it basically takes care of its own memory management

- [00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=282) memory management when the top box is no longer used it's

- [00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=284) when the top box is no longer used it's thrown out

- [00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=285) thrown out and however stack is limited

- [00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=289) and however stack is limited you know that is take overflow exception

- [00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=292) you know that is take overflow exception which means

- [00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=292) which means a stack is full and the entire website

- [00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=295) a stack is full and the entire website is based on stack overflow you already know

- [00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=299) based on stack overflow you already know that i am sure

- [00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=300) that i am sure of it so this is the error of

- [00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=303) of it so this is the error of stack overflowing basically

- [00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=311) out the heap on the other hand has to worry about garbage collection

- [00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=313) worry about garbage collection gc which deals with how to keep the heat

- [00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=315) gc which deals with how to keep the heat clean

- [00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=316) clean no one wants dirty laundry laying around

- [00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=318) no one wants dirty laundry laying around it stinks

- [00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=320) it stinks what goes on the stack and heap we have

- [00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=323) what goes on the stack and heap we have four main types of things we'll be

- [00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=325) four main types of things we'll be putting in the stack and heap as our

- [00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=326) putting in the stack and heap as our code is executing

- [00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=328) code is executing value types reference types pointers and

- [00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=330) value types reference types pointers and instructions

- [00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=332) instructions value types okay let's start taking

- [00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=336) value types okay let's start taking notes

- [00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=337) notes of our lectures

- [00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=350) what are stack in

- [00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=357) dot net and c sharp what are the differences between stack and eve

- [00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=362) differences between stack and eve okay which type of

- [00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=367) okay which type of let's call them as

- [00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=382) let's say audio type of class of room or

- [00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=386) class of room or ins value

- [00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=389) ins value type reference type

- [00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=394) type reference type are put in okay stack

- [00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=397) are put in okay stack and heap memory

- [00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=407) okay and let's continue okay so value types

- [00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=413) in c sharp all the things declared with the following list of type declarations

- [00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=415) the following list of type declarations are value types

- [00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=417) are value types because they are from system dot value

- [00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=418) because they are from system dot value type so these are boolean

- [00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=420) type so these are boolean 0 one byte uh which is

- [00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=424) 0 one byte uh which is uh up to uh zero to two hundred

- [00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=428) uh up to uh zero to two hundred fifty five and character they come on

- [00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=431) fifty five and character they come on double

- [00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=431) double elimination float we already seen all of

- [00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=434) elimination float we already seen all of them actually and that is done

- [00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=436) them actually and that is done reference types reference types

- [00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=440) reference types reference types all the things declared with the types

- [00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=442) all the things declared with the types in this list are reference types and

- [00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=443) in this list are reference types and inherit from system

- [00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=445) inherit from system object except of course for object which

- [00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=448) object except of course for object which is the system

- [00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=449) is the system object object so which are class in

- [00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=452) object object so which are class in in interface delegate object string we

- [00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=455) in interface delegate object string we already know that

- [00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=456) already know that uh string is also a reference type this

- [00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=459) uh string is also a reference type this is important difference

- [00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=461) is important difference actually we will see more about this in

- [00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=463) actually we will see more about this in the next semester in

- [00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=465) the next semester in object-oriented programming language

- [00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=467) object-oriented programming language course

- [00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=468) course so i won't

- [00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=475) get delve into a lot of details here let's just continue to read about

- [00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=477) let's just continue to read about pointers

- [00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=479) pointers pointers the third type of thing to be

- [00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=482) pointers the third type of thing to be put in our memory management scheme is a

- [00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=484) put in our memory management scheme is a reference to a type

- [00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=486) reference to a type a reference is often referred to as a

- [00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=488) a reference is often referred to as a pointer

- [00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=489) pointer we don't explicitly use pointers they

- [00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=491) we don't explicitly use pointers they are managed by the common language

- [00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=493) are managed by the common language runtime

- [00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=494) runtime clr believe me that this is the greatest

- [00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=497) clr believe me that this is the greatest part of c

- [00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=498) part of c sharp when compared to c plus plus or c

- [00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=502) sharp when compared to c plus plus or c you have to work with pointers and they

- [00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=504) you have to work with pointers and they are extremely annoying

- [00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=506) are extremely annoying and i'm glad that there is no they are

- [00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=509) and i'm glad that there is no they are i'm glad that we don't have to use

- [00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=511) i'm glad that we don't have to use pointers in c

- [00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=512) pointers in c sharp for handling object types or

- [00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=514) sharp for handling object types or references

- [00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=515) references or whatever

- [00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=520) or whatever a pointer or reference is different than

- [00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=522) a pointer or reference is different than a reference type and that when we say

- [00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=524) a reference type and that when we say something is a reference type as a means

- [00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=526) something is a reference type as a means we access it through a pointer

- [00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=528) we access it through a pointer okay this is also important there is a

- [00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=530) okay this is also important there is a pointer

- [00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=531) pointer and a reference type and differences

- [00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=534) and a reference type and differences pointer

- [00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=534) pointer points us to the object of reference

- [00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=537) points us to the object of reference type okay and from the picture we will

- [00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=540) okay and from the picture we will understand better

- [00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=542) understand better a pointer is a chunk of space in memory

- [00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=544) a pointer is a chunk of space in memory that points to another space in memory

- [00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=547) that points to another space in memory a pointer takes up space just like any

- [00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=549) a pointer takes up space just like any other thing that we're putting in the

- [00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=550) other thing that we're putting in the stack

- [00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=551) stack and heap and its value is either a

- [00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=552) and heap and its value is either a memory address or null

- [00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=554) memory address or null therefore pointer is very small because

- [00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=556) therefore pointer is very small because it is just pointing to a memory address

- [00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=559) it is just pointing to a memory address however in here the value of pointer can

- [00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=562) however in here the value of pointer can be huge

- [00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=563) be huge pointer can be in stack or in here as

- [00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=565) pointer can be in stack or in here as you can see like here

- [00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=567) you can see like here it can be in both of them okay so

- [00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=571) it can be in both of them okay so what are value types reference types

- [00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=576) what are value types reference types pointers this can these are also

- [00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=579) pointers this can these are also references

- [00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=584) and then there is one thing more which is

- [00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=586) is instructions and instructions are the

- [00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=588) instructions and instructions are the instructions basically

- [00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=591) instructions basically such as method calls or other things

- [00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=600) so this is the how they are stored this is what is about being pointed

- [00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=601) is what is about being pointed in pointer there is no value there is no

- [00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=603) in pointer there is no value there is no data it just points to a memory location

- [00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=606) data it just points to a memory location and from that omega location we read the

- [00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=608) and from that omega location we read the data okay

- [00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=611) data okay and then there is the instructions

- [00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=614) and then there is the instructions instructions you'll see how the

- [00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=617) instructions you'll see how the instructions work later in this article

- [00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=620) instructions work later in this article how is it decided what goes where ha

- [00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=624) how is it decided what goes where ha okay one last thing and we'll get to the

- [00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=627) okay one last thing and we'll get to the fun stuff

- [00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=628) fun stuff here are our two golden rules a

- [00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=631) here are our two golden rules a reference type always goes on the heap

- [00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=633) reference type always goes on the heap easy enough right

- [00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=636) easy enough right value types and pointers always go where

- [00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=638) value types and pointers always go where they were declared

- [00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=640) they were declared this is a little more complex and needs

- [00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=642) this is a little more complex and needs a bit more understanding of how the

- [00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=643) a bit more understanding of how the stack works to figure out where things

- [00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=645) stack works to figure out where things are declared

- [00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=647) are declared the stack as we mentioned earlier is

- [00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=649) the stack as we mentioned earlier is responsible for keeping track of where

- [00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=651) responsible for keeping track of where each thread

- [00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=652) each thread is during the execution of our code or

- [00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=654) is during the execution of our code or what's been called

- [00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=655) what's been called okay this is important you see each

- [00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=657) okay this is important you see each thread

- [00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=659) thread is kept in stack okay

- [00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=662) is kept in stack okay so this is where we store data such as

- [00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=666) so this is where we store data such as which thread is running

- [00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=667) which thread is running executing which method or which code or

- [00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=669) executing which method or which code or whatever

- [00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=670) whatever so it is about keeping things in order

- [00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=674) so it is about keeping things in order you know that our application is running

- [00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=676) you know that our application is running from top to bottom

- [00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=678) from top to bottom and this is done with the stack and with

- [00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=680) and this is done with the stack and with then we can also spawn

- [00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=682) then we can also spawn uh sub threats or tasks or other things

- [00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=685) uh sub threats or tasks or other things and

- [00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=686) and start using more

- [00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=689) start using more threads and they are all kept in stack

- [00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=693) threads and they are all kept in stack memory and it is how stack handles that

- [00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=697) memory and it is how stack handles that and all reference types are going into

- [00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=700) and all reference types are going into heap

- [00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=701) heap so there is no reference type object

- [00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=703) so there is no reference type object stored in stack

- [00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=706) stored in stack however for value types they can be

- [00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=708) however for value types they can be bought in heap or stack

- [00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=714) you can think of it as a thread state and each thread has its own

- [00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=715) and each thread has its own stack when arc so you see each set

- [00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=719) stack when arc so you see each set each thread has their own stack and all

- [00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=722) each thread has their own stack and all threads are

- [00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=723) threads are also kept in a main stack or something

- [00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=726) also kept in a main stack or something like that

- [00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=728) like that our code makes a call to execute a

- [00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=730) our code makes a call to execute a method the thread starts executing the

- [00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=731) method the thread starts executing the instructions that have been jit compiled

- [00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=733) instructions that have been jit compiled and live on the method table

- [00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=735) and live on the method table it also puts the methods parameters on

- [00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=737) it also puts the methods parameters on the thread stack

- [00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=739) the thread stack then as we go through the code and run

- [00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=741) then as we go through the code and run into variables within the method they

- [00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=742) into variables within the method they are placed on top of the stack

- [00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=745) are placed on top of the stack this will be easiest to understand by

- [00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=747) this will be easiest to understand by example

- [00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=748) example take the following method okay this is a

- [00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=751) take the following method okay this is a very really easy

- [00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=752) very really easy method it just adds five to evaluate

- [00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=755) method it just adds five to evaluate that we are getting

- [00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=756) that we are getting so there is end result result is equal

- [00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=759) so there is end result result is equal to value a

- [00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=761) to value a plus five and then we return result so

- [00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=763) plus five and then we return result so here what is happening at the top of

- [00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=765) here what is happening at the top of very stack

- [00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=767) very stack here's what happens at the very top of

- [00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=769) here's what happens at the very top of the stack

- [00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=770) the stack keep in mind that what we are looking at

- [00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=772) keep in mind that what we are looking at is placed on top of many other items

- [00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=774) is placed on top of many other items already living in the stack

- [00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=776) already living in the stack so it is added top of many other items

- [00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=779) so it is added top of many other items okay

- [00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=779) okay and this is important to remember

- [00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=783) and this is important to remember once we start executing the method the

- [00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=785) once we start executing the method the methods parameters are placed on the

- [00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=786) methods parameters are placed on the stack

- [00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=787) stack we'll talk more about passing parameters

- [00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=789) we'll talk more about passing parameters later

- [00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=791) later and it is like that okay uh i won't go

- [00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=794) and it is like that okay uh i won't go more

- [00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=794) more about this because this is the as i said

- [00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=797) about this because this is the as i said the topic of the next semester it is the

- [00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=799) the topic of the next semester it is the topic object-oriented programming

- [00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=803) of the object-oriented programming however if you are interested in you can

- [00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=805) however if you are interested in you can read more

- [00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=806) read more on this article there are also you see

- [00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=808) on this article there are also you see part two part three and part four

- [00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=810) part two part three and part four this is a really long article about

- [00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=814) this is a really long article about heaping and stacking

- [00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=816) heaping and stacking and

- [00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=817) and [Music]

- [00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=819) [Music] can we define heap or stack in c sharp i

- [00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=822) can we define heap or stack in c sharp i think they are fully automatic

- [00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=833) okay i think there is no defining that and there is none hash

- [00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=836) defining that and there is none hash tables and quests

- [00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=837) tables and quests okay so let's uh remember about what's

- [00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=841) okay so let's uh remember about what's hash table

- [00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=857) note here okay let's continue to read hash tables

- [00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=866) the hash table class represents a collection of key and value pairs

- [00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=868) collection of key and value pairs that are organized based on the hash

- [00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=870) that are organized based on the hash code of the key

- [00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=872) code of the key it uses the key to access the elements

- [00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=874) it uses the key to access the elements in the collection

- [00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=876) in the collection a hash table is used when you need to

- [00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=878) a hash table is used when you need to access elements by using key

- [00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=880) access elements by using key and you can identify a useful key value

- [00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=883) and you can identify a useful key value each item in the hash table has a key

- [00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=885) each item in the hash table has a key value pair

- [00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=887) value pair the key is used to access the items in

- [00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=889) the key is used to access the items in the collection

- [00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=890) the collection so it is a thing that keeps things in

- [00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=894) so it is a thing that keeps things in order with keys

- [00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=895) order with keys and values okay so let's

- [00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=900) and values okay so let's do this example

- [00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=907) here okay we are adding hash table and to be able to use h table we have to

- [00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=910) to be able to use h table we have to define

- [00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=913) define okay we have to define system i mean we

- [00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=915) okay we have to define system i mean we have that reference of systems

- [00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=917) have that reference of systems collections here

- [00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=919) collections here then we are adding with keys and values

- [00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=921) then we are adding with keys and values to the hash table

- [00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=922) to the hash table then we can say if h table contains

- [00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=926) then we can say if h table contains or not then we can for each the

- [00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=929) or not then we can for each the [Music]

- [00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=931) [Music] keys and then print the values of h

- [00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=934) keys and then print the values of h table so this is very similar to the

- [00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=937) table so this is very similar to the dictionary what is the difference

- [00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=939) dictionary what is the difference between hash table and dictionary

- [00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=949) hash table and dictionary in okay c-sharp let's see the difference as

- [00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=952) okay c-sharp let's see the difference as well

- [00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=954) well this is exactly as dictionary okay

- [00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=957) this is exactly as dictionary okay they're all printed on the screen

- [00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=961) they're all printed on the screen okay let's see the differences

- [00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=968) the following table lists the differences between hash table and

- [00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=970) differences between hash table and dictionary in c

- [00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=971) dictionary in c sharp hash table

- [00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=974) sharp hash table dictionary hash table is included in the

- [00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=978) dictionary hash table is included in the system

- [00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=978) system collections name space dictionary

- [00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=981) collections name space dictionary is included in the system collections

- [00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=984) is included in the system collections generic namespace

- [00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=987) generic namespace hash table is a loosely typed

- [00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=988) hash table is a loosely typed non-generic collection

- [00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=990) non-generic collection this means it stores key value pairs of

- [00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=992) this means it stores key value pairs of any data types

- [00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=994) any data types dictionary is a generic collection so it

- [00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=997) dictionary is a generic collection so it can store key value pairs of specific

- [00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1000) can store key value pairs of specific data types

- [00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1002) data types okay types

- [00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1005) okay types hash table is thread safe only public

- [00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1008) hash table is thread safe only public static members are thread safe and

- [00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1010) static members are thread safe and dictionary

- [00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1012) dictionary okay so but dictionary is also not very

- [00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1016) okay so but dictionary is also not very actually thread safe i'm not sure if

- [00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1019) actually thread safe i'm not sure if this information is true

- [00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1053) i don't know it is written everywhere but i am not sure if it is threatening

- [00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1054) but i am not sure if it is threatening because i am pretty sure it is

- [00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1084) okay so this is the correct answer yeah you see some of the information you find

- [00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1086) you see some of the information you find on the internet may be wrong

- [00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1088) on the internet may be wrong this is a really important uh difference

- [00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1091) this is a really important uh difference a subtle but important difference is

- [00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1093) a subtle but important difference is that hash table supports multiple reader

- [00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1095) that hash table supports multiple reader threads with a single writer thread

- [00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1097) threads with a single writer thread while dictionary offers no thread safety

- [00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1100) while dictionary offers no thread safety if you need thread safety with a generic

- [00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1102) if you need thread safety with a generic dictionary you must implement your own

- [00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1104) dictionary you must implement your own synchronization or

- [00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1105) synchronization or in dot net 4.0 use

- [00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1109) in dot net 4.0 use use concurrent dictionary and this

- [00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1111) use concurrent dictionary and this answer is given by mark

- [00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1112) answer is given by mark gravel i think this is one of the very

- [00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1115) gravel i think this is one of the very top guys in

- [00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1116) top guys in stack overflow you see

- [00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1119) stack overflow you see and probably very true also mvp

- [00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1124) and probably very true also mvp uh so you see h table is

- [00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1127) uh so you see h table is thread safe for reader threats however

- [00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1129) thread safe for reader threats however for rider threat you also need to have a

- [00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1132) for rider threat you also need to have a synchronization on a single thread i can

- [00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1134) synchronization on a single thread i can write at any time

- [00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1136) write at any time for dictionary there is no trade safety

- [00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1137) for dictionary there is no trade safety for even reading you have to

- [00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1139) for even reading you have to have synchronization and

- [00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1148) okay so in dictionary instance methods are intensive

- [00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1150) are intensive and it's the same so are there any other

- [00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1153) and it's the same so are there any other thing

- [00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1160) there is also another difference okay this was another difference

- [00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1161) this was another difference important one there is one more

- [00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1164) important one there is one more important difference between a hash

- [00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1166) important difference between a hash table and dictionary

- [00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1168) table and dictionary if you use indexers to get a value out

- [00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1170) if you use indexers to get a value out of a hash table

- [00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1171) of a hash table the hash table will successfully return

- [00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1173) the hash table will successfully return null for a non-existent item

- [00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1175) null for a non-existent item whereas the dictionary will throw an

- [00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1176) whereas the dictionary will throw an error if you try accessing an item using

- [00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1179) error if you try accessing an item using an indexer which does not exist in the

- [00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1180) an indexer which does not exist in the dictionary

- [00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1182) dictionary this is also important for so does

- [00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1185) this is also important for so does it does that means that we can

- [00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1188) it does that means that we can access

- [00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1194) a non-existing item like this or other way i will show in a moment

- [00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1203) okay let's try to access it like this and let's see if does

- [00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1204) and let's see if does if it does throw an error

- [00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1208) if it does throw an error okay it doesn't draw another error so

- [00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1210) okay it doesn't draw another error so you can access

- [00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1211) you can access elements of a hash table uh even if the

- [00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1215) elements of a hash table uh even if the if you even if it does not exist so this

- [00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1217) even if it does not exist so this returns no

- [00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1219) returns no let's make a new check quickly like we

- [00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1222) let's make a new check quickly like we have earned it

- [00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1224) have earned it uh like we have learned it so

- [00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1227) uh like we have learned it so [Music]

- [00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1230) [Music] i will do it like this if it is equal to

- [00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1233) i will do it like this if it is equal to nu

- [00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1240) let's say this value does not exist

- [00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1243) does not exist else let's just type the value

- [00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1247) else let's just type the value itself like this

- [00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1252) itself like this and now it will print that this is node

- [00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1262) okay you see this value does not exists okay it's working

- [00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1264) okay it's working and there is also another important

- [00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1267) and there is also another important information

- [00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1273) dictionary is typed so value types don't need boxing

- [00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1274) need boxing a hash table isn't so value types need

- [00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1276) a hash table isn't so value types need boxing

- [00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1277) boxing hash table has a nicer way of obtaining

- [00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1280) hash table has a nicer way of obtaining a value than dictionary imageo

- [00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1282) a value than dictionary imageo because it always knows the value as an

- [00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1284) because it always knows the value as an object

- [00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1285) object though if you're using dotnet 3.5 it's

- [00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1288) though if you're using dotnet 3.5 it's easy to write an extension method for

- [00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1290) easy to write an extension method for dictionary to get similar behavior

- [00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1292) dictionary to get similar behavior okay so what does this means this means

- [00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1295) okay so what does this means this means that

- [00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1297) that let me show you in hash table we don't

- [00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1299) let me show you in hash table we don't define type

- [00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1300) define type so everything is object typed and

- [00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1303) so everything is object typed and that means there will be boxing okay so

- [00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1307) that means there will be boxing okay so let's define a class okay uh

- [00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1310) let's define a class okay uh public class cstamp

- [00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1313) public class cstamp equal to new okay i'm not equal to nip

- [00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1317) equal to new okay i'm not equal to nip of course let's

- [00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1318) of course let's define some integers okay

- [00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1333) whatever we want and now i can compose instance of this class like this okay

- [00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1337) instance of this class like this okay first here instance equal to

- [00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1340) first here instance equal to new class and let's set various

- [00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1343) new class and let's set various something like this

- [00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1344) something like this and this starts

- [00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1347) and this starts this now

- [00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1361) and you see it is asking object key and object value it can be

- [00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1363) object key and object value it can be anything

- [00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1365) anything okay anything and then the value can be

- [00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1367) okay anything and then the value can be this

- [00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1369) this okay

- [00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1374) so what would happen if i added this here

- [00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1388) okay what would it print to the screen it is printing to the screen lecture 13

- [00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1391) it is printing to the screen lecture 13 cmd program

- [00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1392) cmd program plus yes time basically the class itself

- [00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1396) plus yes time basically the class itself because

- [00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1396) because it is boxed as

- [00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1402) it is boxed as class object so i have to change this to

- [00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1405) class object so i have to change this to as is

- [00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1406) as is cstamp then

- [00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1415) i have to use i don't know if this will work

- [00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1417) work okay but

- [00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1426) okay it didn't work this way so if cs time is true

- [00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1441) [Music] okay i also need to take this into a

- [00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1444) okay i also need to take this into a parenthesis

- [00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1445) parenthesis and then okay still not visible live

- [00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1450) and then okay still not visible live they are public so let's take this as

- [00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1454) they are public so let's take this as like this

- [00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1459) like this okay okay property

- [00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1462) okay okay property us um just itself

- [00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1466) us um just itself this thing

- [00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1485) okay the value is still not it yeah

- [00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1492) so why i think it is because plus and

- [00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1496) plus and you see you have to put them into the

- [00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1498) you see you have to put them into the correct parenthesis

- [00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1501) correct parenthesis and now let's retry

- [00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1507) okay we are able to print the as you can see

- [00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1507) see the value right now so this is how

- [00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1509) the value right now so this is how useful is is

- [00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1512) useful is is however if this was dictionary i would

- [00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1514) however if this was dictionary i would have to have

- [00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1515) have to have a strong typing

- [00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1522) like let me show you okay to be able to use dictionary

- [00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1525) use dictionary i need to add collections generic and

- [00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1527) i need to add collections generic and then string as a key

- [00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1529) then string as a key anything can be key and value will be

- [00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1531) anything can be key and value will be cstamp otherwise i can't add

- [00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1535) cstamp otherwise i can't add okay like this i will initialize it

- [00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1540) okay like this i will initialize it and then i can add values as

- [00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1544) and then i can add values as here simply so this is the difference

- [00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1547) here simply so this is the difference between

- [00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1549) between dictionary and hash tables

- [00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1559) and okay there's true [Music]

- [00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1569) let's read this answer as well hash table class is a specific type of

- [00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1571) hash table class is a specific type of dictionary class that uses an integer

- [00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1573) dictionary class that uses an integer value

- [00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1574) value called a hash to aid in the storage of

- [00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1576) called a hash to aid in the storage of its keys

- [00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1577) its keys the hash table class uses the hash to

- [00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1580) the hash table class uses the hash to speed up the searching for a specific

- [00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1581) speed up the searching for a specific key in the collection

- [00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1583) key in the collection every object in dot net derives from the

- [00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1586) every object in dot net derives from the object class

- [00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1587) object class this class supports the get hash method

- [00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1590) this class supports the get hash method which returns an integer that uniquely

- [00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1592) which returns an integer that uniquely identifies the object

- [00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1594) identifies the object the hash table class is a very efficient

- [00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1596) the hash table class is a very efficient collection in general

- [00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1598) collection in general the only issue with the hash table class

- [00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1600) the only issue with the hash table class is that it requires a bit of overhead

- [00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1602) is that it requires a bit of overhead and for small collections fewer than 10

- [00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1605) and for small collections fewer than 10 elements the overhead can impede

- [00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1606) elements the overhead can impede performance

- [00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1608) performance okay so

- [00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1627) okay there's another important answer as well

- [00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1628) well let's starting from here i look up

- [00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1631) let's starting from here i look up interface is used in

- [00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1632) interface is used in net 3.5 with link the hash table is the

- [00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1636) net 3.5 with link the hash table is the base class that is weekly type

- [00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1638) base class that is weekly type the dictionary base abstract class is

- [00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1641) the dictionary base abstract class is strongly typed and uses internally a

- [00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1643) strongly typed and uses internally a hash table

- [00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1645) hash table i found a a strange thing about

- [00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1646) i found a a strange thing about dictionary when we have the multiple

- [00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1648) dictionary when we have the multiple entries in dictionary

- [00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1649) entries in dictionary the order in which the entries are added

- [00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1651) the order in which the entries are added is maintained

- [00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1653) is maintained thus if i apply a for each on the

- [00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1654) thus if i apply a for each on the dictionary i will get the records in the

- [00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1657) dictionary i will get the records in the same order i have inserted them

- [00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1659) same order i have inserted them whereas this is not true with normal

- [00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1662) whereas this is not true with normal hash table as when i add same records in

- [00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1664) hash table as when i add same records in hash table the order is not maintained

- [00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1667) hash table the order is not maintained as far as my knowledge goes dictionary

- [00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1669) as far as my knowledge goes dictionary is based on hash table

- [00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1671) is based on hash table if this is true why my dictionary

- [00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1673) if this is true why my dictionary maintains the order but hash table does

- [00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1675) maintains the order but hash table does not

- [00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1676) not as to why they behave differently it's

- [00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1679) as to why they behave differently it's because generic dictionary implements a

- [00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1680) because generic dictionary implements a hash table but is not based on system

- [00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1683) hash table but is not based on system collections hash table the generic

- [00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1686) collections hash table the generic dictionary implementation is based on

- [00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1688) dictionary implementation is based on allocating key value pairs from a list

- [00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1691) allocating key value pairs from a list these are then indexed with the hash

- [00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1692) these are then indexed with the hash table buckets for random access

- [00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1694) table buckets for random access but when it returns an enumerator it

- [00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1696) but when it returns an enumerator it just walks the list in sequential order

- [00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1698) just walks the list in sequential order which will be the order of insertion as

- [00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1700) which will be the order of insertion as long as entries are not reused

- [00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1704) long as entries are not reused okay so these are the differences and

- [00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1708) okay so these are the differences and the threat safety is not correct okay

- [00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1711) the threat safety is not correct okay this is also true

- [00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1712) this is also true and data rate level is slower than

- [00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1715) and data rate level is slower than dictionary because of boxing and

- [00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1716) dictionary because of boxing and unboxing we have already

- [00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1718) unboxing we have already shown that what is boxing and unboxing

- [00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1721) shown that what is boxing and unboxing it it just re

- [00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1722) it it just re turns everything into a object type

- [00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1725) turns everything into a object type and then we need to do unboxing like

- [00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1727) and then we need to do unboxing like this here

- [00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1729) this here okay so let's see let's type that

- [00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1749) okay and then there's quiz

- [00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1773) c sharp q t q is a special type of collection that stores the elements in

- [00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1775) collection that stores the elements in fifo style

- [00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1776) fifo style first in first out exactly opposite of

- [00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1779) first in first out exactly opposite of the stack t

- [00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1779) the stack t collection it contains the elements in

- [00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1782) collection it contains the elements in the order they were added

- [00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1784) the order they were added see okay so first thing first thought

- [00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1787) see okay so first thing first thought incitec

- [00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1788) incitec last in first art okay

- [00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1792) last in first art okay why because the last in

- [00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1795) why because the last in is hold at the top in stack

- [00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1798) is hold at the top in stack and therefore it is lost in first start

- [00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1801) and therefore it is lost in first start and in

- [00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1802) and in fifo it is first in first off

- [00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1808) c-sharp includes generic qt and non-generic cue collection

- [00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1810) non-generic cue collection it is recommended to use the generic qt

- [00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1813) it is recommended to use the generic qt collection

- [00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1814) collection you see there is uh the word that we

- [00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1817) you see there is uh the word that we always see generic

- [00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1818) always see generic and in this lecture i am going to show

- [00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1821) and in this lecture i am going to show you what

- [00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1822) you what what does generic means and how to

- [00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1825) what does generic means and how to how do we use it qt characteristics

- [00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1830) how do we use it qt characteristics qt is fifo first in first out collection

- [00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1834) qt is fifo first in first out collection it comes under system collection generic

- [00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1837) it comes under system collection generic namespace

- [00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1839) namespace qt can contain elements of the specified

- [00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1841) qt can contain elements of the specified type

- [00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1842) type it provides compile-time type checking

- [00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1845) it provides compile-time type checking and doesn't perform boxing unboxing

- [00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1847) and doesn't perform boxing unboxing because it is generic

- [00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1848) because it is generic okay so there is no boxing and unboxing

- [00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1851) okay so there is no boxing and unboxing in

- [00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1852) in queue therefore we have to define the

- [00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1855) queue therefore we have to define the type in here

- [00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1860) elements can be added using the nq method

- [00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1861) method cannot use collection initializer syntax

- [00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1865) cannot use collection initializer syntax elements can be retrieved using the dq

- [00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1867) elements can be retrieved using the dq and the peak methods

- [00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1869) and the peak methods it does not support an indexer okay so

- [00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1872) it does not support an indexer okay so there is also another

- [00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1873) there is also another indexer and let's just

- [00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1877) indexer and let's just make this example here

- [00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1884) okay so we are defining a queue it is coming under systems collections generic

- [00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1887) coming under systems collections generic and we are adding as you can see four

- [00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1889) and we are adding as you can see four parameters

- [00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1890) parameters and this integer we can also make it as

- [00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1893) and this integer we can also make it as string as well

- [00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1895) string as well it is up to us we can make it anything

- [00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1897) it is up to us we can make it anything we want so let's

- [00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1901) we want so let's enter here

- [00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1907) one so it can hold any data as long as we define that

- [00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1910) hold any data as long as we define that data

- [00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1912) data or then you see we are able to for each

- [00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1916) or then you see we are able to for each that

- [00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1917) that and this is right

- [00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1922) and this is right okay so what happens after we

- [00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1925) okay so what happens after we write them onto the screen

- [00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1935) okay they are reading like this and uh

- [00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1939) reading like this and uh okay it's they are still there so this

- [00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1941) okay it's they are still there so this will console right line okay

- [00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1946) console right line okay and then there is also nqdq peak and

- [00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1948) and then there is also nqdq peak and contains

- [00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1960) in this for each actually it turns them into a list

- [00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1963) into a list therefore they are not affected uh

- [00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1966) therefore they are not affected uh not take it or something so this is

- [00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1968) not take it or something so this is another example we include them

- [00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1971) another example we include them we write the number of elements like

- [00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1973) we write the number of elements like this then

- [00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1974) this then we are right rightlining but with dq

- [00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1976) we are right rightlining but with dq then there won't left any elements

- [00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1978) then there won't left any elements we will see that okay so the

- [00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1982) we will see that okay so the elements are like this and then

- [00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1986) elements are like this and then zero elements is left and they are

- [00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1992) zero elements is left and they are printed on the screen with the order

- [00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1994) printed on the screen with the order they are added as you can see

- [00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=1996) they are added as you can see hello okay then there is also peak

- [00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=2000) hello okay then there is also peak let's check out the peak as well

- [00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=2009) okay we don't need this in the net console and we're working with

- [00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=2011) console and we're working with debug okay so

- [00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=2020) then we will use peak so the peak will show the first or yeah first element

- [00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=2023) show the first or yeah first element only

- [00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=2024) only okay so does this take another thing

- [00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=2028) okay so does this take another thing no it doesn't take any value so with

- [00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=2031) no it doesn't take any value so with peak we can only see the

- [00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=2032) peak we can only see the first element in the queue nothing else

- [00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=2041) yeah and it won't remove the element it doesn't support

- [00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=2043) doesn't support [Music]

- [00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=2045) [Music] indexing like we can't access element

- [00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=2048) indexing like we can't access element like this

- [00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=2049) like this because it doesn't support indexing you

- [00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=2052) because it doesn't support indexing you see cannot apply indexing with

- [00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=2053) see cannot apply indexing with expression of type

- [00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=2055) expression of type cure and

- [00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=2059) cure and yeah there is nothing else about qs

- [00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=2075) okay what is also use q and then there is

- [00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=2079) also use q and then there is nq d2 and q

- [00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=2086) [Music] kdq

- [00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=2096) contains okay and okay we have seen all these okay now

- [00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=2099) okay we have seen all these okay now time to see operator overloading method

- [00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=2101) time to see operator overloading method overloading and method overriding

- [00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=2103) overloading and method overriding actually we all already have seen all of

- [00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=2106) actually we all already have seen all of this but

- [00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=2107) this but we will just remember again

- [00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=2141) okay i think this is a good article to check it out you can redefine or

- [00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=2144) check it out you can redefine or overload most of the built-in operators

- [00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=2146) overload most of the built-in operators available in c-sharp

- [00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=2148) available in c-sharp okay so here we are overloading uh the

- [00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=2151) okay so here we are overloading uh the built-in operators that we

- [00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=2153) built-in operators that we commonly use okay vesa programmer can

- [00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=2158) commonly use okay vesa programmer can use operators with user defined types as

- [00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=2161) operators with user defined types as well

- [00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=2162) well overloaded operators are functions with

- [00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=2164) overloaded operators are functions with special names the keyword operator

- [00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=2166) special names the keyword operator followed by the symbol for the operator

- [00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=2168) followed by the symbol for the operator being defined

- [00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=2169) being defined similar to any other function an

- [00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=2171) similar to any other function an overloaded operator has a return type

- [00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=2174) overloaded operator has a return type and a parameter list

- [00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=2176) and a parameter list okay so there is an example a box

- [00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=2179) okay so there is an example a box operator

- [00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=2180) operator which which takes two box instances

- [00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=2184) which which takes two box instances and then returns a new box okay

- [00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=2188) and then returns a new box okay so uh here i will uh

- [00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=2192) so uh here i will uh [Music]

- [00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=2193) [Music] quote a custom class uh to illustrate

- [00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=2196) quote a custom class uh to illustrate what does this mean

- [00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=2200) what does this mean perhaps easier one okay

- [00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=2204) perhaps easier one okay so let's put them into as

- [00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=2207) so let's put them into as the first part

- [00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=2214) the first part or let's say part one

- [00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=2224) like this and we can add it here and then comment it out okay so let's

- [00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=2227) and then comment it out okay so let's assume that we have public

- [00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=2230) assume that we have public uh calculus okay class

- [00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=2233) uh calculus okay class car and here let's define some

- [00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=2236) car and here let's define some properties

- [00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=2238) properties okay such as

- [00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=2247) okay i will define this as long and total

- [00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=2251) long and total weight okay

- [00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=2254) weight okay and prop and long

- [00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=2258) and prop and long okay

- [00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=2270) and okay and so here i define

- [00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=2274) so here i define two car instances car one equal to new

- [00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=2278) two car instances car one equal to new car and total price will be

- [00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=2282) car and total price will be one 1000 k

- [00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=2290) 100 us dollar and total weight will be let's say

- [00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=2291) let's say 100 kilograms for first one and then car

- [00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=2294) 100 kilograms for first one and then car 2 equal to new car

- [00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=2298) 2 equal to new car and total price

- [00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=2302) and total price will be

- [00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=2317) and now it will tell me to rename and it will rename all references

- [00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=2319) will rename all references here like this and

- [00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=2323) here like this and let's make this like this and

- [00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=2327) let's make this like this and car weights actually let's call this as

- [00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=2330) car weights actually let's call this as price

- [00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=2330) price and this as weight okay

- [00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=2334) and this as weight okay so and the weights let's make this as

- [00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=2336) so and the weights let's make this as 250

- [00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=2339) 250 okay two thousand five hundred actually

- [00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=2342) okay two thousand five hundred actually and this is the price okay

- [00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=2346) and this is the price okay so

- [00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=2353) then uh let's make car plus car 2 equal to or let's make something like

- [00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=2356) 2 equal to or let's make something like this

- [00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=2357) this car car 3 equal to carbon plus car 2

- [00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=2362) car car 3 equal to carbon plus car 2 okay you see this is not working because

- [00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=2365) okay you see this is not working because we don't

- [00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=2366) we don't have plus operator

- [00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=2369) have plus operator so we need to have an operator for plus

- [00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=2373) so we need to have an operator for plus sign

- [00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=2374) sign and we are going to write an uh we are

- [00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=2378) and we are going to write an uh we are going to write uh

- [00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=2379) going to write uh operator overloading for this i think it

- [00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=2382) operator overloading for this i think it may suggest

- [00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=2383) may suggest us a solution

- [00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=2391) for potential fixes nothing let's write right public

- [00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=2394) let's write right public static

- [00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=2400) okay it will return car type and the operator we are going to overload this

- [00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=2401) operator we are going to overload this plus

- [00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=2402) plus here and then it will take car

- [00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=2406) here and then it will take car e and car c whatever we want okay

- [00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=2411) e and car c whatever we want okay so it is still telling us that one of

- [00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=2413) so it is still telling us that one of the parameters of binary operator must

- [00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=2414) the parameters of binary operator must be containing type

- [00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=2422) okay so let's look for this

- [00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=2433) error type oh it is asking this okay it's fine this is fine

- [00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=2435) it's fine this is fine so what does this going to do

- [00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=2439) so what does this going to do is

- [00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=2446) actually we need to look for this not the other one

- [00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=2455) okay implicit operators okay this is the operator like this

- [00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=2458) okay this is the operator like this interesting so

- [00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=2463) interesting so here we are going to generate a cash

- [00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=2466) here we are going to generate a cash d equal to new cash

- [00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=2469) d equal to new cash like this and d dot

- [00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=2473) like this and d dot price equal to b dot price

- [00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=2477) price equal to b dot price plus c dot price

- [00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=2480) plus c dot price and then um d that's

- [00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=2483) and then um d that's a weight equal to p dot

- [00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=2487) a weight equal to p dot base plus c dot wait

- [00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=2490) base plus c dot wait and it's been returned d

- [00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=2494) and it's been returned d however still this is giving an error

- [00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=2498) however still this is giving an error one of the parameters of a binary

- [00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=2500) one of the parameters of a binary operator what does this mean

- [00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=2502) operator what does this mean in reality

- [00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=2519) okay it says that it has to follow some certain

- [00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=2523) follow some certain rules but visuals

- [00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=2536) rules but visuals hmm

- [00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=2598) and we take cars here what happens

- [00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=2605) cars here what happens um no this is not the reason

- [00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=2620) car b car c it returns cos and plus sign one of the parameters of

- [00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=2624) and plus sign one of the parameters of a binary operator must be the containing

- [00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=2646) okay let's look the example given here okay this is box b and box c

- [00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=2655) however this is not working for us right now

- [00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=2657) now and the reason is

- [00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=2662) and the reason is okay the reason is interesting

- [00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=2674) okay so this is the correct formatting but still we have a problem

- [00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=2677) but still we have a problem i am not able to overload

- [00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=2681) i am not able to overload or plus operators

- [00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=2684) or plus operators for car b and c

- [00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=2690) for car b and c so this is close box define it here

- [00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=2698) okay so we have to define this operator inside

- [00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=2699) inside this class here i understand now

- [00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=2702) this class here i understand now like this yeah

- [00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=2705) like this yeah now it is working okay

- [00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=2715) and so now we are uh we have overloaded the class operator

- [00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=2719) the class operator this is operator of loading

- [00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=2722) this is operator of loading and which our which operator we are

- [00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=2725) and which our which operator we are overloading we are operator overloading

- [00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=2733) binary operators plus operators

- [00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=2741) and then let's say i am typing console.writeline

- [00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=2747) cartridge okay so now i need to overload control

- [00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=2751) so now i need to overload control writeline as well

- [00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=2752) writeline as well to print it as i want and

- [00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=2755) to print it as i want and therefore i'm going to overload that

- [00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=2758) therefore i'm going to overload that as well public static

- [00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=2762) as well public static void and how am i gonna overload it

- [00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=2767) void and how am i gonna overload it [Music]

- [00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=2780) actually this will this may be overriding two of us

- [00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=2782) overriding two of us let me check it

- [00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=2790) yeah this is overwrite not overload now i am going to override

- [00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=2803) console.writeline okay how do we do it without overloading

- [00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=2817) let's try it like this and here i will take cash

- [00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=2820) and here i will take cash see

- [00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=2828) okay it says this class cannot be inherited and

- [00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=2835) yeah i am not able to overwrite like this

- [00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=2845) let's define a method name as this

- [00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=2851) okay so this will be car that bright line you see and this is not exactly

- [00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=2856) you see and this is not exactly overriding

- [00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=2865) so let me check it out overwrites also

- [00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=2869) overwrites also white line i wonder if this is possible

- [00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=2882) anyway let's use this so this will take car c and when i make it

- [00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=2886) this will take car c and when i make it like this

- [00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=2887) like this uh it will be directly usable

- [00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=2891) uh it will be directly usable as an extension and now it says that

- [00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=2895) as an extension and now it says that it has to inside the top class

- [00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=2899) it has to inside the top class like here

- [00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=2915) extension this is method extension keyboard okay let's

- [00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=2918) keyboard okay let's take the notes

- [00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=2931) or overloading up to overload

- [00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=2934) up to overload plus sign for a custom

- [00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=2938) plus sign for a custom plus what is

- [00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=2941) plus what is method extension

- [00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=2948) how to extend a method for a custom class

- [00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=2953) a method for a custom class okay now instead of uh

- [00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=2956) okay now instead of uh [Music]

- [00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=2958) [Music] console right and i will just use

- [00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=2961) console right and i will just use cartridge dot

- [00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=2963) cartridge dot right line

- [00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=2993) i can program that right behind this car oh

- [00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=2993) oh so this is extending program right now

- [00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=3003) and program is our clause and it says that extension method must be defined in

- [00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=3006) that extension method must be defined in a non-generic static class yeah that is

- [00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=3008) a non-generic static class yeah that is the reason

- [00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=3009) the reason you see you have to check the errors so

- [00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=3011) you see you have to check the errors so therefore i need to add another class

- [00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=3013) therefore i need to add another class to here as

- [00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=3017) to here as of uh upper up of the

- [00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=3021) of uh upper up of the program class i can do it like this as

- [00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=3023) program class i can do it like this as well i think yeah

- [00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=3026) well i think yeah now it should appear

- [00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=3038) because it is not under any class and every method in c sharp has to be under

- [00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=3041) every method in c sharp has to be under a class therefore global

- [00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=3044) a class therefore global class or let's say global

- [00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=3048) class or let's say global methods

- [00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=3055) this will be a public static class and it's under lecture 13 cmd

- [00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=3059) and it's under lecture 13 cmd and now it should work

- [00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=3062) and now it should work here but now it is saying that there is

- [00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=3066) here but now it is saying that there is no card class therefore i need to add

- [00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=3069) no card class therefore i need to add using

- [00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=3070) using static program

- [00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=3074) static program actual lectures 13 cmd

- [00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=3078) actual lectures 13 cmd dot program now it will

- [00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=3081) dot program now it will say car and

- [00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=3088) it says that program car is less accessible than method

- [00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=3090) accessible than method therefore let's check our probably class

- [00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=3094) therefore let's check our probably class card

- [00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=3097) card wireless accessible

- [00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=3110) is also published why it is less accessible

- [00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=3116) okay now the right line is appearing so that message is probably incorrect

- [00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=3123) that message is probably incorrect interesting

- [00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=3133) they are both public and under lecture 13

- [00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=3138) cmd this would use console.writeline um

- [00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=3142) this would use console.writeline um see that

- [00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=3151) price okay let's add little formatting okay car price

- [00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=3168) say that applies to string mid and 0 formatting

- [00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=3170) formatting and then

- [00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=3189) has say that's way to string and zero

- [00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=3194) way to string and zero let's add kilogram and

- [00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=3205) okay however much less compile maybe it is incorrect error message sometimes

- [00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=3207) it is incorrect error message sometimes it happens

- [00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=3208) it happens no so it says incorrect accessibility

- [00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=3223) maybe since because this is not oh this is not public yeah that is the

- [00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=3225) oh this is not public yeah that is the reason now it will be

- [00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=3227) reason now it will be accessible you see when i make the

- [00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=3231) accessible you see when i make the program class accessible it becomes

- [00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=3233) program class accessible it becomes accessible and

- [00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=3234) accessible and normal errors so

- [00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=3238) normal errors so here it will work okay let's check it

- [00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=3240) here it will work okay let's check it out

- [00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=3241) out so we have done methods overriding

- [00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=3245) so we have done methods overriding and we haven't done method overloading

- [00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=3247) and we haven't done method overloading yet we did method extension

- [00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=3250) yet we did method extension now it is working and now

- [00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=3253) now it is working and now we need to make

- [00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=3257) we need to make methods overloading too

- [00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=3261) methods overloading too so four method overloading

- [00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=3266) so four method overloading let's define some internal

- [00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=3271) let's define some internal methods of car class

- [00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=3295) let's add a good overloading example

- [00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=3306) and how to make it i'm thinking about that

- [00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=3307) that okay i will make it like this

- [00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=3314) so you see uh this is method extension and let's define two other methods here

- [00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=3318) and let's define two other methods here as

- [00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=3320) as take double this will take

- [00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=3324) take double this will take car c as a parameter

- [00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=3328) car c as a parameter and there will be another

- [00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=3331) and there will be another actual let's say multiply

- [00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=3335) actual let's say multiply car and

- [00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=3339) car and then there will be another method

- [00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=3342) then there will be another method this will be car c and car d public

- [00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=3344) this will be car c and car d public static car by the way

- [00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=3347) static car by the way and this will be public speak card as

- [00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=3349) and this will be public speak card as well and this will take

- [00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=3350) well and this will take car c instead of car c and d i will take

- [00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=3354) car c instead of car c and d i will take i enumerable

- [00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=3356) i enumerable car class list

- [00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=3360) car class list okay and

- [00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=3364) okay and this will return a

- [00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=3367) this will return a new car okay and the price will be equal

- [00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=3372) new car okay and the price will be equal to

- [00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=3372) to c dot price multiply with d

- [00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=3376) c dot price multiply with d dot price

- [00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=3384) price and the weight will be okay c dot paid multiply with

- [00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=3388) okay c dot paid multiply with d dot weight okay

- [00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=3396) and this will uh be a little bit different

- [00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=3397) different cash nib cash

- [00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=3405) will be okay equal to okay nib cash

- [00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=3408) okay nib cash and here what we are going to do is we

- [00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=3410) and here what we are going to do is we are going to enumerate

- [00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=3413) are going to enumerate this card list

- [00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=3419) by the way when i am defining this uh i will

- [00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=3420) will assign two one is by default there are

- [00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=3424) assign two one is by default there are no therefore

- [00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=3427) no therefore okay when we define nerf car we need to

- [00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=3429) okay when we define nerf car we need to set some initial values as

- [00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=3432) set some initial values as price equal to one and weight equal to

- [00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=3435) price equal to one and weight equal to one okay and this will be a car

- [00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=3439) okay and this will be a car actually your car in the

- [00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=3443) actually your car in the list and

- [00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=3446) list and maybe you wonder what what is the

- [00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=3448) maybe you wonder what what is the difference between i any enable and any

- [00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=3451) difference between i any enable and any variable

- [00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=3471) okay so it is asked as the difference between i animal and unenabled

- [00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=3479) i enumerable and enumerable class implements the innumerable interface

- [00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=3482) implements the innumerable interface the innumerable interface has only one

- [00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=3485) the innumerable interface has only one method get enumerator

- [00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=3486) method get enumerator which returns an i enumerator interface

- [00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=3498) i enumerable is an interface it is part of system.collection namespace

- [00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=3500) of system.collection namespace and it has one method get a numerator

- [00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=3503) and it has one method get a numerator this is the method the for each loop

- [00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=3505) this is the method the for each loop uses loop through a collection and

- [00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=3506) uses loop through a collection and returns an i enumerator interface dot an

- [00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=3509) returns an i enumerator interface dot an enumerable class is part of link library

- [00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=3511) enumerable class is part of link library and is a bunch of extension methods

- [00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=3513) and is a bunch of extension methods written for the i enumerable interface

- [00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=3516) written for the i enumerable interface it has many extension methods like first

- [00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=3518) it has many extension methods like first first or default

- [00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=3519) first or default any last laster default max sum

- [00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=3523) any last laster default max sum average etc okay so actually we should

- [00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=3526) average etc okay so actually we should use an email instead of i animatable and

- [00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=3530) an email instead of i animatable and but now it will tell me to

- [00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=3534) but now it will tell me to okay use link you and to use link you i

- [00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=3538) okay use link you and to use link you i have to install package because because

- [00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=3539) have to install package because because it is not available by default

- [00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=3542) it is not available by default so i am adding link your package right

- [00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=3545) so i am adding link your package right now

- [00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=3566) okay what if we make it our universal can we make it as sum

- [00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=3580) yeah it is working here yeah we don't even need

- [00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=3581) even need for each because obviously our universal

- [00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=3585) for each because obviously our universal is supporting link queue

- [00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=3589) is supporting link queue okay here fine and it will just return a

- [00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=3594) okay here fine and it will just return a new car

- [00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=3595) new car as price equal to selecting prices

- [01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=3600) as price equal to selecting prices of the list like this and pay it will be

- [01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=3604) of the list like this and pay it will be equal to

- [01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=3606) equal to list starts okay sum

- [01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=3614) you see a link here is how much making our life easier with our universal interface

- [01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=3625) okay so this is method overloading you see there are

- [01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=3627) method overloading you see there are exactly same method

- [01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=3629) exactly same method you see their return type is same their

- [01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=3632) you see their return type is same their name is same

- [01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=3633) name is same however the parameters the signature

- [01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=3636) however the parameters the signature they take is different the signature of

- [01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=3639) they take is different the signature of a first method is the signature

- [01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=3642) a first method is the signature of first method is

- [01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=3646) of first method is car and car however the signature of the

- [01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=3650) car and car however the signature of the second method is

- [01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=3653) second method is of the second method is an i

- [01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=3657) of the second method is an i variable okay object

- [01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=3661) variable okay object therefore they are different okay this

- [01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=3664) therefore they are different okay this is

- [01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=3665) is method overloading okay

- [01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=3670) method overloading okay and now i am going to

- [01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=3674) and now i am going to show you how they would work from global

- [01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=3677) show you how they would work from global methods

- [01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=3678) methods that rightline or not write line

- [01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=3682) that rightline or not write line multiply curve

- [01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=3697) car one equal to and then let's add let's make it like this okay carbon and

- [01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=3700) let's make it like this okay carbon and car 2 then

- [01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=3703) car 2 then let's make another car as vr car 2 which

- [01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=3707) let's make another car as vr car 2 which will take

- [01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=3714) nev i enumerable or list we can make it as least as well

- [01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=3715) as least as well and we can even make it as

- [01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=3718) and we can even make it as la vr carbon car one car two

- [01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=3722) la vr carbon car one car two uh car three car one r2 whatever we want

- [01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=3728) uh car three car one r2 whatever we want then we will use right line

- [01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=3731) then we will use right line our method before doing that let's add

- [01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=3734) our method before doing that let's add console.writeline

- [01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=3736) console.writeline uh it will the right empty line and here

- [01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=3741) uh it will the right empty line and here i will use right line as

- [01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=3751) okay let's also make an overload for right line here so this takes car c

- [01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=3755) right line here so this takes car c and then let's string

- [01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=3758) and then let's string addition and by default i will make it

- [01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=3761) addition and by default i will make it null

- [01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=3769) so um we will append it to the beginning like

- [01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=3771) we will append it to the beginning like this

- [01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=3773) this since it will be null i think it will

- [01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=3775) since it will be null i think it will automatically handle it

- [01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=3777) automatically handle it by the console.writeline so here's i

- [01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=3780) by the console.writeline so here's i will tell at an addition as currently light

- [01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=3784) tell at an addition as currently light line

- [01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=3785) line and here uh car three

- [01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=3788) and here uh car three like this and for this one

- [01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=3792) like this and for this one or actually this will be vr car one yeah

- [01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=3797) or actually this will be vr car one yeah we are car one and we are car

- [01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=3801) we are car one and we are car true so we are doing

- [01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=3804) true so we are doing a method overloading here

- [01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=3811) a method overloading here okay so vr carvan car price is

- [01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=3814) okay so vr carvan car price is this and this this

- [01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=3817) this and this this okay so you see uh this is not

- [01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=3821) okay so you see uh this is not exactly

- [01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=3828) the thing we wanted to see because we were expecting a multiply

- [01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=3832) see because we were expecting a multiply here but we did

- [01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=3833) here but we did summarization instead of

- [01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=3837) summarization instead of multiplication so how do we how can we

- [01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=3839) multiplication so how do we how can we multiply

- [01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=3840) multiply it

- [01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=3845) i don't know if it doesn't multiply methods probably no

- [01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=3852) methods probably no okay so what we need to do is we need to

- [01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=3855) okay so what we need to do is we need to select

- [01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=3880) sorry about that link cue multiply

- [01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=3893) sorry about that okay so let's see if it is possible

- [01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=3899) okay so it is agree uh aggregate function let's read what it is

- [01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=3920) the aggregate function takes in an initial accumulator value

- [01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=3921) initial accumulator value and then applies an operation to every

- [01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=3923) and then applies an operation to every value in the enumeration

- [01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=3925) value in the enumeration creating a new accumulator value here we

- [01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=3928) creating a new accumulator value here we start with one and then multiply ever

- [01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=3930) start with one and then multiply ever value by the current value of the

- [01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=3932) value by the current value of the accumulator

- [01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=3934) accumulator note in the case of an empty int's value

- [01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=3937) note in the case of an empty int's value this will return one

- [01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=3939) this will return one this makes okay so let's use

- [01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=3942) this makes okay so let's use uh aggregate method

- [01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=3950) and let's see what does it do so the aggregate methods will take

- [01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=3959) we will start from zero applies an accumulated function over second so it

- [01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=3961) accumulated function over second so it will summarize whatever there is and it will

- [01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=3964) summarize whatever there is and it will take

- [01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=3966) take here that's no

- [01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=3978) x and i how can you do it so here's

- [01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=4000) maybe we can apply it like select pr dot your price

- [01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=4003) pr dot your price then we can use aggregate as

- [01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=4008) then we can use aggregate as zero and

- [01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=4020) okay so where is we are making an error stage

- [01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=4034) cannot implicitly convert type known to int

- [01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=4041) so i have to make this long to do that i need to add

- [01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=4043) need to add no as not f but l

- [01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=4047) no as not f but l so this means that this is long okay

- [01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=4051) so this means that this is long okay and it says the opposite digit values as

- [01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=4055) and it says the opposite digit values as for clarity

- [01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=4092) all right and we will apply the same for uh weight so i'm just doing a copy paste

- [01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=4096) uh weight so i'm just doing a copy paste okay so the weight will be equal to

- [01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=4100) okay so the weight will be equal to okay so what is this if you wonder

- [01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=4105) okay so what is this if you wonder this means that it will multiply

- [01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=4109) this means that it will multiply all values and it will add them to

- [01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=4112) all values and it will add them to this

- [01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=4119) okay i'm not sure if it will work like that let's try it

- [01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=4127) okay it is zero so it is just aggregating with

- [01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=4128) aggregating with it i mean it's multiplying with that so

- [01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=4131) it i mean it's multiplying with that so first it will take

- [01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=4132) first it will take x as one then y as another value and

- [01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=4136) x as one then y as another value and yes it should work this way

- [01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=4145) okay so it has become two bigger long therefore they have become

- [01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=4155) a negative value so let's try something easier so

- [01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=4158) something easier so we are carvan and let's

- [01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=4162) we are carvan and let's multiply it we are car one let's try

- [01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=4165) multiply it we are car one let's try what happens

- [01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=4174) okay so the car weight is correct it is multiplication of this

- [01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=4188) watch it and this yeah however it was too for

- [01:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=4191) it was too for a car price

- [01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=4195) a car price so let's make our numbers a little bit

- [01:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=4198) so let's make our numbers a little bit smaller like 10 or five

- [01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=4202) smaller like 10 or five and seven let's make it two and three

- [01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=4207) and seven let's make it two and three and three and four and

- [01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=4211) and three and four and now we can see it if it's working or not

- [01:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=4216) now we can see it if it's working or not okay so the car one is six uh

- [01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=4220) okay so the car one is six uh i'm in the vr car one and car two is 12

- [01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=4224) i'm in the vr car one and car two is 12 so we have multiplied it three times

- [01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=4228) so we have multiplied it three times let's check it out okay

- [01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=4232) let's check it out okay and then this okay 1728 as you can see

- [01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=4238) and then this okay 1728 as you can see and let's see the price six six and six

- [01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=4242) and let's see the price six six and six yes it is working as expected as we

- [01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=4245) yes it is working as expected as we wanted

- [01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=4246) wanted and this is what is method

- [01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=4249) and this is what is method overloading okay so this is method

- [01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=4253) overloading okay so this is method overloading this is a

- [01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=4255) overloading this is a method extension and

- [01:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=4263) this is method overriding actually this is

- [01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=4264) is more like operator overloading yeah

- [01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=4270) more like operator overloading yeah and did we make a method overriding

- [01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=4273) and did we make a method overriding example no

- [01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=4275) example no let's also make a method overriding

- [01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=4278) let's also make a method overriding example

- [01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=4287) we haven't done that yet so let's also make an example of method

- [01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=4289) also make an example of method overriding

- [01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=4291) overriding let's first take notes of this

- [01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=4307) because what is methods overloading and how to

- [01:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=4311) overloading and how to get methods on a custom

- [01:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=4314) get methods on a custom class method

- [01:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=4322) okay what is modded overlining um operator over loading and how to

- [01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=4342) this is much operator overriding operators

- [01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=4368) yeah this is correct and now we are at the method overriding

- [01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=4384) method overriding in c sharp is similar to the virtual function in c

- [01:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=4386) to the virtual function in c plus method overriding is a technique

- [01:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=4389) plus method overriding is a technique that allows the invoking of functions

- [01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=4391) that allows the invoking of functions from another class

- [01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=4392) from another class base class in the derived class creating

- [01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=4395) base class in the derived class creating a method in the derived class with the

- [01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=4397) a method in the derived class with the same signature as a method in the base

- [01:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=4399) same signature as a method in the base class is called as method overriding okay so

- [01:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=4402) is called as method overriding okay so this is uh the topic of the next semester in

- [01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=4406) is uh the topic of the next semester in object oriented programming

- [01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=4408) object oriented programming however i will show you an example a

- [01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=4411) however i will show you an example a simple example

- [01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=4412) simple example of that quickly

- [01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=4417) of that quickly so here we have a calculus right

- [01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=4421) so here we have a calculus right here now i am going to inherit calculus

- [01:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=4425) here now i am going to inherit calculus with

- [01:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=4426) with such as trucks and it will

- [01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=4429) such as trucks and it will inherit calculus like this okay

- [01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=4438) public class rocks so this will have all the public methods and

- [01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=4441) all the public methods and properties of this class

- [01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=4445) properties of this class let's also add a

- [01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=4449) let's also add a method here as let's say public static

- [01:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=4454) method here as let's say public static void print car

- [01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=4463) and this will print such as console.writeline

- [01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=4465) console.writeline okay car price equal to

- [01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=4471) we already have this but just for illustration proposals i am

- [01:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=4474) illustration proposals i am making a simple example this dot

- [01:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=4477) making a simple example this dot actually it will just it can directly

- [01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=4481) actually it will just it can directly access the price

- [01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=4482) access the price parameters however i have to make this

- [01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=4485) parameters however i have to make this not static to access its

- [01:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=4489) static to access its instances and then

- [01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=4493) instances and then like this cash weight

- [01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=4507) wait okay so i want to overwrite this method

- [01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=4511) so i want to overwrite this method how am i going to do that i'm going to

- [01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=4513) how am i going to do that i'm going to do that with

- [01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=4521) something like this public overwrite public override void print cache

- [01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=4524) public override void print cache okay and when do we overwrite it

- [01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=4538) we have to first mark this as mutual now i can override it and

- [01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=4541) now i can override it and the overrided method will be as

- [01:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=4546) the overrided method will be as car price with bigger

- [01:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=4552) letters and also let's add format

- [01:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=4561) so basically [Music]

- [01:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=4563) [Music] now this will use this method

- [01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=4566) now this will use this method instead of this method call when we

- [01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=4568) instead of this method call when we define

- [01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=4569) define an instance of a track such as

- [01:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=4573) an instance of a track such as tracks how do we how did we define it

- [01:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=4579) tracks how do we how did we define it okay t equal to like

- [01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=4582) okay t equal to like vr cartoon

- [01:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=4589) and it says it cannot implicitly convert because it is

- [01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=4591) implicitly convert because it is inheriting class

- [01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=4593) inheriting class therefore let's try it like this

- [01:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=4602) and then i will just use print cache here and before doing that i

- [01:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=4606) print cache here and before doing that i will use print card here

- [01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=4609) will use print card here and just before that let's type

- [01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=4612) and just before that let's type okay card class print print

- [01:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=4616) okay card class print print like this and then track class speeds

- [01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=4628) since this inherited class child class it should work

- [01:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=4636) it should work or unable to cause car to type crowd

- [01:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=4639) or unable to cause car to type crowd trucks

- [01:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=4650) so it didn't work as expected maybe i can do this like this i'm not

- [01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=4654) maybe i can do this like this i'm not sure if it will work

- [01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=4656) sure if it will work as trucks

- [01:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=4664) probably it will yield the same results but

- [01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=4666) but oh now it has returned no

- [01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=4669) oh now it has returned no therefore it didn't work

- [01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=4691) how to get basically instances from drivers plus

- [01:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=4710) or maybe like this yeah yeah let's try that

- [01:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=4716) will be equal to nev trucks and it will take

- [01:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=4723) okay we are car two however probably i need to write and

- [01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=4725) need to write and methods overloading for this a

- [01:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=4727) methods overloading for this a constructor so let's add a constructor

- [01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=4730) constructor so let's add a constructor here

- [01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=4731) here uh spam which trucks

- [01:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=4739) which takes instance of cars car d like this

- [01:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=4746) and these dots price will be equal to okay d dot price

- [01:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=4755) and this dot which will be equal to d dot page

- [01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=4756) dot page yeah now it will work and

- [01:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=4759) yeah now it will work and yeah now it is working

- [01:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=4775) okay let's rerun the application okay so the cr truck class print car

- [01:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=4778) okay so the cr truck class print car is like this price this and car weight

- [01:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=4781) is like this price this and car weight is this

- [01:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=4782) is this and car price is uh

- [01:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=4786) and car price is uh okay we have some

- [01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=4790) okay we have some car class prince

- [01:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=4818) let's add some new lines because now it is a little bit confusing

- [01:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=4829) yeah i know the reason yeah now i get it you have to use this

- [01:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=4833) you have to use this okay and like this

- [01:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=4838) okay and like this and white line like this now it will be

- [01:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=4842) and white line like this now it will be better formatted

- [01:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=4844) better formatted and easier to understand okay so the

- [01:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=4847) and easier to understand okay so the calculus print is printed like this and

- [01:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=4849) calculus print is printed like this and the thread class print printed like this

- [01:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=4851) the thread class print printed like this so this is method

- [01:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=4853) so this is method overriding you can overwrite a method if

- [01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=4856) overriding you can overwrite a method if it is marked

- [01:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=4857) it is marked as uh i think virtual

- [01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=4860) as uh i think virtual and let's see

- [01:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=4881) okay so this is uh enough to know right now

- [01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=4884) enough to know right now because we will see more details about

- [01:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=4887) because we will see more details about this topic in the next semester as i

- [01:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=4889) this topic in the next semester as i said

- [01:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=4890) said and how to override a

- [01:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=4894) and how to override a method marked as virtual

- [01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=4898) method marked as virtual in the parent class

- [01:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=4902) in the parent class this is another topic of the next

- [01:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=4904) this is another topic of the next semester in object oriented but

- [01:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=4906) semester in object oriented but we are having just an idea right now

- [01:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=4909) we are having just an idea right now okay now we we also have seen value and

- [01:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=4913) now we we also have seen value and reference type

- [01:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=4915) reference type let's remove this as well and

- [01:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=4920) let's remove this as well and yeah now time for anonymous and dynamic

- [01:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=4923) yeah now time for anonymous and dynamic types

- [01:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=4925) types these are really important so let's

- [01:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=4927) these are really important so let's start with anonymous type

- [01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=4929) start with anonymous type first

- [01:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=4942) this is really important to understand let's read it in original

- [01:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=4954) anonymous types provide a convenient way to encapsulate a set of read-only

- [01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=4956) to encapsulate a set of read-only properties into a single object without

- [01:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=4958) properties into a single object without having to explicitly define a type first

- [01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=4961) having to explicitly define a type first the type name is generated by the

- [01:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=4963) the type name is generated by the compiler and is not available at the

- [01:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=4965) compiler and is not available at the source code level

- [01:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=4966) source code level the type of each property is inferred by

- [01:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=4969) the type of each property is inferred by the compiler

- [01:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=4971) the compiler you create anonymous types by using the

- [01:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=4973) you create anonymous types by using the new operator together with an

- [01:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=4975) new operator together with an object initializer for more information

- [01:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=4978) object initializer for more information about object initializers see object and

- [01:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=4981) object initializers see object and collection initializers

- [01:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=4984) collection initializers okay so here's there is an example as

- [01:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=4986) okay so here's there is an example as var v

- [01:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=4987) var v equal to new amount and message hello

- [01:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=4991) equal to new amount and message hello and console write like this

- [01:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=4997) anonymous types typically are used in the select clause of a query expression

- [01:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=4999) the select clause of a query expression to return a subset of the properties

- [01:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5001) to return a subset of the properties from each object in the source sequence

- [01:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5004) from each object in the source sequence for more information about queries clinq

- [01:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5007) for more information about queries clinq and c-sharp

- [01:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5009) and c-sharp anonymous types contain one or more

- [01:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5011) anonymous types contain one or more public read-only properties

- [01:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5013) public read-only properties no other kinds of class members such as

- [01:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5016) no other kinds of class members such as methods or events are valid

- [01:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5018) methods or events are valid the expression that is used to

- [01:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5020) the expression that is used to initialize a property cannot be null

- [01:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5022) initialize a property cannot be null an anonymous function or a pointer type

- [01:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5028) the most common scenario is to initialize an anonymous type with

- [01:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5030) initialize an anonymous type with properties from another type

- [01:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5032) properties from another type in the following example assume that a

- [01:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5035) in the following example assume that a class exists that is named product

- [01:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5037) class exists that is named product class product includes color and price

- [01:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5039) class product includes color and price properties together with other

- [01:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5041) properties together with other properties that you are not interested

- [01:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5043) properties that you are not interested in

- [01:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5044) in variable products is a collection of

- [01:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5046) variable products is a collection of product objects

- [01:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5048) product objects the anonymous type declaration starts

- [01:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5050) the anonymous type declaration starts with the new keyword

- [01:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5052) with the new keyword the declaration initializes a new type

- [01:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5054) the declaration initializes a new type that uses only two properties from

- [01:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5056) that uses only two properties from product

- [01:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5057) product actually we have seen this when we were

- [01:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5060) actually we have seen this when we were working with anti-framework selection

- [01:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5062) working with anti-framework selection query

- [01:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5064) query uh so here there's an also an example

- [01:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5067) uh so here there's an also an example like this from product

- [01:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5068) like this from product and things and

- [01:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5071) and things and there is no food for example

- [01:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5075) there is no food for example maybe there is a better example on here

- [01:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5084) maybe there is a better example on here so they are starting with new keyboard

- [01:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5086) so they are starting with new keyboard only

- [01:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5088) only and then we can use them like this

- [01:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5096) okay so there is a there is a example here first let me take this into the

- [01:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5100) here first let me take this into the part two

- [01:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5119) okay now let's uh test this code so you see this is anonymous type a you

- [01:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5121) so you see this is anonymous type a you see

- [01:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5122) see and it takes id so id is being integer

- [01:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5126) and it takes id so id is being integer however i can make this long

- [01:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5127) however i can make this long as well or i can make this double as

- [01:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5129) as well or i can make this double as well like this

- [01:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5130) well like this so it will be automatically understood

- [01:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5132) so it will be automatically understood by the compiler

- [01:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5135) by the compiler then we will be able to rightline them

- [01:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5137) then we will be able to rightline them however this will

- [01:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5139) however this will give me an error because you cannot

- [01:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5143) give me an error because you cannot change value of an anonymous type so

- [01:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5145) change value of an anonymous type so they are read only

- [01:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5148) they are read only okay so this is what is anonymous type

- [01:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5160) unless types okay anonymous objects are read only

- [01:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5163) objects are read only okay so let's output

- [01:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5173) and they are printed okay so are there anything that we need to know

- [01:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5175) anything that we need to know there can be also a nested anonymous

- [01:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5177) there can be also a nested anonymous type

- [01:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5178) type like this

- [01:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5184) here we have id first name last name and address this is also another

- [01:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5186) and address this is also another anonymous type

- [01:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5188) anonymous type and it says there is already a student

- [01:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5191) and it says there is already a student so we can make this like this

- [01:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5195) so we can make this like this so you see this then being an anonymous

- [01:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5197) so you see this then being an anonymous type

- [01:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5199) type normally we would we have to define a cl

- [01:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5202) normally we would we have to define a cl class a custom class for to define this

- [01:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5205) class a custom class for to define this however

- [01:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5212) now we can define it like this with uh read only properties as an anonymous

- [01:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5214) read only properties as an anonymous type

- [01:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5216) type so student two that for example

- [01:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5220) so student two that for example address okay that

- [01:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5223) address okay that city i can access it like this

- [01:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5232) let's see and it is here so this is the nested anonymous type

- [01:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5240) okay unless it's anonymous right object

- [01:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5247) and any other important thing okay it is most important to read

- [01:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5253) an anonymous type will always be local to the method where it is defined

- [01:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5255) to the method where it is defined it cannot be returned from the method

- [01:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5258) it cannot be returned from the method however

- [01:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5259) however an anonymous type can be passed to the

- [01:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5261) an anonymous type can be passed to the method as object type parameter

- [01:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5263) method as object type parameter but it is not recommended if you need to

- [01:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5265) but it is not recommended if you need to pass it to another method

- [01:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5267) pass it to another method then use struct or class instead of an

- [01:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5269) then use struct or class instead of an anonymous type

- [01:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5270) anonymous type so if you are going to pass an instance

- [01:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5272) so if you are going to pass an instance of anonymous type you should use struct

- [01:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5274) of anonymous type you should use struct or class not anonymous type okay

- [01:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5279) class not anonymous type okay mostly anonymous types are created using

- [01:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5282) mostly anonymous types are created using the select clause of a linq

- [01:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5284) the select clause of a linq queries to return a subset of the

- [01:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5286) queries to return a subset of the properties from each object in the

- [01:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5287) properties from each object in the collection

- [01:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5289) collection okay so there is a good example

- [01:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5292) okay so there is a good example to illustrate this so we have public

- [01:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5295) to illustrate this so we have public class

- [01:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5296) class um students like this

- [01:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5299) um students like this let's give this a new name oh we don't

- [01:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5302) let's give this a new name oh we don't need a new name

- [01:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5303) need a new name and then we can use to select subject

- [01:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5307) and then we can use to select subject a subset like this so we have

- [01:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5311) a subset like this so we have uh an eye list of student list

- [01:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5314) uh an eye list of student list and it has five students like this

- [01:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5318) and it has five students like this then we are going to select subs list

- [01:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5322) then we are going to select subs list of students like this from the student

- [01:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5325) of students like this from the student list

- [01:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5326) list and it says that select is not

- [01:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5329) and it says that select is not found i know because i need to add link

- [01:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5332) found i know because i need to add link here

- [01:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5334) here okay system dot link here now it's

- [01:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5337) okay system dot link here now it's probably

- [01:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5338) probably working here you see it is selecting a

- [01:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5342) working here you see it is selecting a new subset

- [01:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5343) new subset with anonymous type like this so we are

- [01:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5346) with anonymous type like this so we are getting only

- [01:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5348) getting only 13 values out of a list

- [01:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5351) 13 values out of a list this would be very useful when we are

- [01:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5353) this would be very useful when we are working with

- [01:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5354) working with entity framework and database tables

- [01:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5357) entity framework and database tables let's say i only want to select two uh

- [01:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5363) let's say i only want to select two uh uh columns of a table and i can select

- [01:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5366) uh columns of a table and i can select it as a new anonymous type

- [01:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5368) it as a new anonymous type like this okay so let's run the

- [01:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5372) like this okay so let's run the application

- [01:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5373) application and see so it

- [01:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5376) and see so it prints them like this so basically we

- [01:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5378) prints them like this so basically we have selected only 20

- [01:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5380) have selected only 20 only two columns out of a table for

- [01:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5383) only two columns out of a table for example

- [01:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5384) example like here otherwise this wouldn't be

- [01:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5392) possible to handle this easy we would be needed to

- [01:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5396) handle this easy we would be needed to call custom classes method overloadings

- [01:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5399) call custom classes method overloadings or such

- [01:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5400) or such but with anonymous types we can

- [01:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5403) but with anonymous types we can select a subset of a collection

- [01:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5417) okay anonymous type objects are most commonly used to select

- [01:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5421) are most commonly used to select a subset of

- [01:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5425) a subset of a collection like blue okay this was a

- [01:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5428) a collection like blue okay this was a great example

- [01:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5430) great example and yeah

- [01:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5434) and yeah let's read this in the above example

- [01:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5438) let's read this in the above example a select clause in the linq query

- [01:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5441) a select clause in the linq query selects only student id

- [01:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5442) selects only student id and student name properties and renames

- [01:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5444) and student name properties and renames it to id and name

- [01:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5446) it to id and name respectively thus it is useful in saving

- [01:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5449) respectively thus it is useful in saving memory

- [01:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5450) memory and unnecessary code the query result

- [01:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5453) and unnecessary code the query result collection includes only student id

- [01:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5455) collection includes only student id and student name properties as shown in

- [01:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5457) and student name properties as shown in the following debug view

- [01:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5460) the following debug view visual studio supports intellisense for

- [01:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5462) visual studio supports intellisense for anonymous types

- [01:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5463) anonymous types as shown below this is great you see uh

- [01:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5466) as shown below this is great you see uh that is why i like the most visual

- [01:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5468) that is why i like the most visual studio for developing

- [01:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5470) studio for developing applications its intellisense is great i

- [01:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5472) applications its intellisense is great i don't know if it is

- [01:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5474) don't know if it is possible in other ideas

- [01:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5477) possible in other ideas integrated development environments

- [01:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5486) okay and we can also give a custom name you see like id or name of the

- [01:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5490) you see like id or name of the selected parameter and we can directly

- [01:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5492) selected parameter and we can directly access them like this

- [01:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5493) access them like this it is all done with intellisense and

- [01:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5497) it is all done with intellisense and it will be checked at the compile time

- [01:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5500) it will be checked at the compile time you see now i am getting an error

- [01:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5502) you see now i am getting an error therefore it prevents me to compile

- [01:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5506) therefore it prevents me to compile with ernest code it is great believe me

- [01:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5510) with ernest code it is great believe me and now there is dynamic types and

- [01:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5515) and now there is dynamic types and generics we haven't come to generics yet

- [01:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5517) generics we haven't come to generics yet but before

- [01:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5518) but before delving into generics let's remember the

- [01:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5521) delving into generics let's remember the difference between structs

- [01:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5523) difference between structs and classes

- [01:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5537) okay because structs are also important uh part of programming development

- [01:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5541) uh part of programming development structs are like versions of classes

- [01:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5544) structs are like versions of classes structs are value types and can be used

- [01:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5546) structs are value types and can be used to create objects that behave like

- [01:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5548) to create objects that behave like built-in types

- [01:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5549) built-in types this is important normally

- [01:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5553) this is important normally when we copy

- [01:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5559) reference types they just copy their pointers

- [01:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5560) pointers what i mean is student list 2 equal to

- [01:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5564) what i mean is student list 2 equal to student list okay then

- [01:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5573) i will write line i will change to as an element of student list 2

- [01:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5576) element of student list 2 for example the second index

- [01:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5579) for example the second index dot h equal to 100 okay

- [01:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5582) dot h equal to 100 okay then i will write line

- [01:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5590) okay student list one

- [01:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5605) okay h and the other object student list two

- [01:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5627) this is also the topic of object oriented programming but

- [01:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5629) oriented programming but let's just have an idea

- [01:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5633) let's just have an idea so normally it was age

- [01:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5642) 18 i assigned a new student list like this a new

- [01:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5645) a new student list like this a new object

- [01:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5646) object and i'll change it the student list2h

- [01:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5649) and i'll change it the student list2h so what do you expect to be printed 18

- [01:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5653) so what do you expect to be printed 18 and 100

- [01:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5654) and 100 no it will be bought 100 because

- [01:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5657) no it will be bought 100 because this simply this simply

- [01:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5661) this simply this simply copy the pointer

- [01:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5664) copy the pointer of a student list

- [01:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5668) of a student list into the student list

- [01:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5672) into the student list two object so they

- [01:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5676) two object so they point to the same values whatever

- [01:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5680) point to the same values whatever change we made on values

- [01:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5683) change we made on values will be reflected

- [01:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5688) will be reflected to the both objects

- [01:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5692) to the both objects because they point to the

- [01:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5696) because they point to the same values okay they are just

- [01:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5699) same values okay they are just they are just memory

- [01:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5703) they are just memory addresses okay like a street address

- [01:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5707) addresses okay like a street address so let's run the application

- [01:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5714) okay they are both 100 so this is a ver struct

- [01:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5715) struct make difference let me show you i will

- [01:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5718) make difference let me show you i will define a public struct

- [01:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5721) define a public struct and st student okay

- [01:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5724) and st student okay so in here we will have some properties

- [01:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5727) so in here we will have some properties as

- [01:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5728) as public int irh

- [01:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5733) public int irh and let's have student name okay

- [01:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5737) and let's have student name okay prof okay and student name

- [01:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5750) like this now i will compose two instances of sc student student one

- [01:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5754) instances of sc student student one will be equal to name student and let's

- [01:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5757) will be equal to name student and let's set its values

- [01:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5758) set its values as 21 and name

- [01:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5770) okay like this then i will generate another student

- [01:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5771) another student as these students okay student two

- [01:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5775) as these students okay student two it will be equal to student one okay

- [01:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5792) actually let's make them like this okay set st student one

- [01:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5796) okay set st student one and a c assistant 2

- [01:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5800) and a c assistant 2 like this

- [01:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5808) ok now i will change the value of st student 2

- [01:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5812) of st student 2 okay like h equal to 100

- [01:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5815) okay like h equal to 100 then i will uh rightline them

- [01:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5822) okay let's see if there will be any difference

- [01:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5824) difference okay one uh h

- [01:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5828) okay one uh h equal to

- [01:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5839) prh and i stitched to them too okay uh h equal to

- [01:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5842) okay uh h equal to a system to irh

- [01:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5846) a system to irh now what do we expect to see let's run

- [01:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5849) now what do we expect to see let's run the application to see the difference

- [01:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5852) the application to see the difference you see 21 and 100 now it is behaving

- [01:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5855) you see 21 and 100 now it is behaving like a value type this is the difference

- [01:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5859) like a value type this is the difference also this truck is being kept

- [01:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5863) also this truck is being kept in uh

- [01:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5865) in uh [Music]

- [01:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5867) [Music] uh what was it let me

- [01:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5870) uh what was it let me remember in here

- [01:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5874) remember in here instead of stack that is also difference

- [01:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5883) okay probably i'm not sure what probably it is captain heap or stock let me check

- [01:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5886) it is captain heap or stock let me check it

- [01:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5888) it okay maybe it is written here as well

- [01:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5891) okay maybe it is written here as well let's continue reading

- [01:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5893) let's continue reading structs share many features with classes

- [01:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5895) structs share many features with classes but with the following limitations as

- [01:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5897) but with the following limitations as compared to classes

- [01:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5900) compared to classes struct cannot have a default constructor

- [01:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5902) struct cannot have a default constructor a constructor without parameters

- [01:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5904) a constructor without parameters or a destructor so struck cannot have

- [01:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5907) or a destructor so struck cannot have a constructor like this

- [01:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5911) a constructor like this a public struct

- [01:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5920) and no okay it says that structs cannot contain explicit

- [01:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5922) structs cannot contain explicit parameters constructors

- [01:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5924) parameters constructors okay so we need to have

- [01:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5930) okay so we need to have like i heard

- [01:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5936) [Music] two okay

- [01:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5948) and then i have to set it r1 and s only

- [01:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5952) r1 and s only equals sr2 like this

- [01:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5955) equals sr2 like this let's see yeah so it has to be

- [01:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5958) let's see yeah so it has to be parameterable

- [01:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5959) parameterable okay uh if if

- [01:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5963) okay uh if if we don't make that it won't work

- [01:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5967) we don't make that it won't work so i wonder if this will work let me

- [01:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5970) so i wonder if this will work let me check something

- [01:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5983) yeah okay so this is working and this is one uh example there are also

- [01:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5986) this is one uh example there are also destructors

- [01:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5987) destructors let's also learn that what is that

- [01:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5990) let's also learn that what is that structs are value types

- [01:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5992) structs are value types and are copied on assignment this is

- [01:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5994) and are copied on assignment this is really important if you want

- [01:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5996) really important if you want something values to be copied over

- [01:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=5999) something values to be copied over assignment you have to use subtract not

- [01:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6001) assignment you have to use subtract not classes

- [01:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6002) classes okay this is a key issue so here we are

- [01:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6005) okay this is a key issue so here we are using an

- [01:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6006) using an assignment and this is copying values

- [01:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6009) assignment and this is copying values okay it is not just copying reference

- [01:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6012) okay it is not just copying reference this is copying

- [01:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6014) this is copying values since it is struct type

- [01:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6018) values since it is struct type on classes it just copies

- [01:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6022) on classes it just copies reference okay not the values

- [01:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6032) values and exponential structs are value types while classes

- [01:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6034) structs are value types while classes are reference types

- [01:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6035) are reference types yes structs can be instantiated without

- [01:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6038) yes structs can be instantiated without using a new operator

- [01:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6041) using a new operator a struct cannot inherit from another

- [01:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6043) a struct cannot inherit from another structure class

- [01:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6044) structure class and it cannot be the base of a class so

- [01:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6047) and it cannot be the base of a class so it cannot be inherited

- [01:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6050) it cannot be inherited all strucks inherit directly from system

- [01:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6052) all strucks inherit directly from system dot value type

- [01:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6053) dot value type which inherits from system object

- [01:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6057) which inherits from system object struct cannot be a base class so

- [01:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6060) struct cannot be a base class so struct types cannot abstract and are

- [01:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6062) struct types cannot abstract and are always implicitly sealed

- [01:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6065) always implicitly sealed abstract and sealed class is also topic

- [01:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6068) abstract and sealed class is also topic of next semester in object-oriented

- [01:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6069) of next semester in object-oriented programming

- [01:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6071) programming abstract and sealed modifiers are not

- [01:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6073) abstract and sealed modifiers are not allowed instruct member cannot be

- [01:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6075) allowed instruct member cannot be protected or protected internals

- [01:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6079) protected or protected internals function members in a struct cannot be

- [01:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6080) function members in a struct cannot be abstract or virtual

- [01:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6082) abstract or virtual and the override modifier is allowed

- [01:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6084) and the override modifier is allowed only to the override methods inherited

- [01:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6086) only to the override methods inherited from system dot value type

- [01:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6089) from system dot value type struct does not allow the instance field

- [01:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6091) struct does not allow the instance field declarations to include variable

- [01:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6092) declarations to include variable initializers

- [01:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6094) initializers but static fields of a struct are

- [01:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6096) but static fields of a struct are allowed to include variable initializers

- [01:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6099) allowed to include variable initializers a struct can implement interfaces

- [01:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6103) a struct can implement interfaces a struct can be used as a nullable type

- [01:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6105) a struct can be used as a nullable type and can be assigned a null value

- [01:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6108) and can be assigned a null value okay so the question comes when to use

- [01:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6111) okay so the question comes when to use struct or classes

- [01:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6112) struct or classes if you can use threat and solve your

- [01:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6114) if you can use threat and solve your problem you should use struct because

- [01:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6116) problem you should use struct because structs are much more

- [01:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6119) structs are much more and harder to make mistakes since it

- [01:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6122) and harder to make mistakes since it just copies the values it is not

- [01:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6124) just copies the values it is not reference types

- [01:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6126) reference types okay so what is struct

- [01:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6131) okay so what is struct how to use struts

- [01:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6134) how to use struts what are the differences between

- [01:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6138) what are the differences between struct and class objects

- [01:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6147) okay when to use when to use struct or a class

- [01:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6156) at class and use extract or a plus okay let's see the example are the

- [01:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6159) let's see the example are the [Music]

- [01:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6160) [Music] differences

- [01:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6178) when to use struct or classes to answer this question

- [01:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6179) this question we should have a good understanding of

- [01:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6180) we should have a good understanding of the differences

- [01:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6182) the differences s dot n struct

- [01:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6186) s dot n struct classes one

- [01:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6190) classes one structs are value types allocated either

- [01:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6192) structs are value types allocated either on the stack

- [01:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6193) on the stack or inline in containing types so

- [01:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6196) or inline in containing types so they are allocated on stack not on heap

- [01:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6200) they are allocated on stack not on heap and or inline containing types

- [01:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6204) and or inline containing types i don't know what does this mean

- [01:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6206) i don't know what does this mean actually

- [01:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6207) actually classes are reference types allocated on

- [01:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6210) classes are reference types allocated on the heap and garbage collected

- [01:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6212) the heap and garbage collected so this is important they are garbage

- [01:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6214) so this is important they are garbage collected

- [01:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6215) collected and what kind of

- [01:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6218) and what kind of problem this may cause to us

- [01:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6221) problem this may cause to us i'm not sure let's continue

- [01:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6224) i'm not sure let's continue allocations and allocations of value

- [01:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6227) allocations and allocations of value types are in general cheaper than

- [01:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6228) types are in general cheaper than allocations

- [01:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6229) allocations and allocations of reference types so

- [01:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6231) and allocations of reference types so they are lighter weight

- [01:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6233) they are lighter weight as you can see

- [01:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6239) assignments of large reference types are cheaper than assignments of large value

- [01:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6241) cheaper than assignments of large value types

- [01:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6242) types so if your object is very large

- [01:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6246) so if your object is very large then reference types are cheaper as in

- [01:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6249) then reference types are cheaper as in assignments

- [01:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6250) assignments because they just assigned to pointers

- [01:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6253) because they just assigned to pointers not copy the values

- [01:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6256) not copy the values in structs each variable contains its

- [01:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6259) in structs each variable contains its own copy of the data

- [01:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6260) own copy of the data except in the case of the ref and now

- [01:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6262) except in the case of the ref and now parameter variables

- [01:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6263) parameter variables and an operation on one variable does

- [01:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6265) and an operation on one variable does not affect another variable

- [01:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6268) not affect another variable in classes two variables can contain the

- [01:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6270) in classes two variables can contain the reference of the same object

- [01:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6272) reference of the same object and any operation on one variable can

- [01:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6274) and any operation on one variable can affect another variable

- [01:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6275) affect another variable yeah we have shown that already and

- [01:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6277) yeah we have shown that already and [Music]

- [01:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6279) [Music] continue s dot n okay sorry about that

- [01:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6285) continue s dot n okay sorry about that it should start here s dot n

- [01:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6304) s dot n okay why it is not working s dotted

- [01:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6308) why it is not working s dotted anyway let me read it in this way struct

- [01:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6310) anyway let me read it in this way struct should be used only when you are

- [01:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6312) should be used only when you are sure that it logically represents a

- [01:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6315) sure that it logically represents a single value like perimeter types in

- [01:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6317) single value like perimeter types in double etc

- [01:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6318) double etc it is immutable immutable means that

- [01:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6321) it is immutable immutable means that when you

- [01:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6323) when you change it or copy it it will always

- [01:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6325) change it or copy it it will always generate a name

- [01:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6327) generate a name instance okay so it is it may be

- [01:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6330) instance okay so it is it may be expensive

- [01:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6331) expensive it should not be boxed and unbox it

- [01:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6333) it should not be boxed and unbox it frequently

- [01:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6334) frequently so this is probably harder as well

- [01:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6337) so this is probably harder as well and a strike example is given here

- [01:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6341) and a strike example is given here okay personally i would suggest you to

- [01:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6345) okay personally i would suggest you to use strut

- [01:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6346) use strut if you can solve your problem with that

- [01:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6350) if you can solve your problem with that because i think it is harder to make

- [01:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6353) because i think it is harder to make mistakes it is lighter weight

- [01:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6356) mistakes it is lighter weight and let's uh

- [01:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6360) and let's uh look for some uh comparison

- [01:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6372) let's say garbage collection memory usage comparison

- [01:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6374) usage comparison these are

- [01:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6398) okay so there's coding for performance track versus colossus

- [01:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6406) i think this is an article let's read it instances of a class are always

- [01:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6408) instances of a class are always allocated on the heap and accessed via a

- [01:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6410) allocated on the heap and accessed via a pointer to reference

- [01:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6412) pointer to reference passing them around is cheap because it

- [01:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6414) passing them around is cheap because it is just a copy of the pointer

- [01:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6416) is just a copy of the pointer four or eight bytes however an object

- [01:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6419) four or eight bytes however an object also has some fixed overhead

- [01:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6421) also has some fixed overhead eight bytes for 32-bit processes and 16

- [01:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6424) eight bytes for 32-bit processes and 16 bytes for 64-bit processes

- [01:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6427) bytes for 64-bit processes this overhead includes the pointer to

- [01:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6428) this overhead includes the pointer to the method table and a sync block field

- [01:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6431) the method table and a sync block field that is used for multiple purposes

- [01:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6433) that is used for multiple purposes however if you examined an object that

- [01:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6435) however if you examined an object that had no fields in the debugger

- [01:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6437) had no fields in the debugger you would see that the size is reported

- [01:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6439) you would see that the size is reported as 12 bytes 32 bit

- [01:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6441) as 12 bytes 32 bit or 24 bytes 64-bit

- [01:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6444) or 24 bytes 64-bit why is that net will align all objects

- [01:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6448) why is that net will align all objects in memory

- [01:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6448) in memory and these are the effective minimum

- [01:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6450) and these are the effective minimum object sizes

- [01:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6453) object sizes a struct has no overhead at all and its

- [01:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6455) a struct has no overhead at all and its memory usage

- [01:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6456) memory usage is a sum of the size of all its fields

- [01:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6459) is a sum of the size of all its fields if a struct is declared as a local

- [01:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6461) if a struct is declared as a local variable in a method

- [01:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6462) variable in a method then the struct is allocated on the

- [01:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6464) then the struct is allocated on the stack okay this is important

- [01:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6466) stack okay this is important so when we define struct inside a local

- [01:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6469) so when we define struct inside a local variable

- [01:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6470) variable in a method it will be allocated on the

- [01:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6472) in a method it will be allocated on the stack

- [01:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6473) stack okay such as

- [01:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6476) okay such as let's make an example of that

- [01:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6480) let's make an example of that for example um

- [01:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6484) for example um inside let's find the methods

- [01:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6493) okay that we have coders like here okay so for example i define a

- [01:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6496) like here okay so for example i define a struct here

- [01:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6499) struct here as test it

- [01:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6502) as test it has something like this

- [01:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6511) but this is not the inline struct actually

- [01:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6520) i think this means that instance of extract yeah yeah

- [01:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6523) extract yeah yeah so if i define an instance of a struct

- [01:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6525) so if i define an instance of a struct such as

- [01:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6531) okay what was our struct name it was student

- [01:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6538) like this gg equal to student this will be all located on

- [01:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6541) student this will be all located on here okay because it will alive only

- [01:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6544) here okay because it will alive only for the duration of print car method

- [01:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6547) for the duration of print car method execution

- [01:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6549) execution it will be therefore allocated on stack

- [01:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6552) it will be therefore allocated on stack yeah not hip

- [01:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6553) yeah not hip i just said incorrectly stack

- [01:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6558) i just said incorrectly stack if the struct is declared as part of a

- [01:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6559) if the struct is declared as part of a class then the struct's memory will be

- [01:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6562) class then the struct's memory will be part of that class's memory layout

- [01:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6564) part of that class's memory layout and thus exist on the heap when you pass

- [01:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6566) and thus exist on the heap when you pass a struct to a method

- [01:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6567) a struct to a method it is copied bite for bite because it is

- [01:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6570) it is copied bite for bite because it is not on the heap

- [01:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6571) not on the heap allocating a struct will never cause a

- [01:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6573) allocating a struct will never cause a garbage collection

- [01:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6575) garbage collection yeah this is what it is so stack is

- [01:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6578) yeah this is what it is so stack is managed

- [01:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6579) managed stack is not managed by garbage

- [01:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6581) stack is not managed by garbage collection

- [01:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6582) collection i think it is managed by sierra let's

- [01:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6585) i think it is managed by sierra let's check it

- [01:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6587) check it okay stack is managed uh

- [01:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6590) okay stack is managed uh if not garbage collector these are all

- [01:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6593) if not garbage collector these are all advanced stuff by the way

- [01:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6597) advanced stuff by the way okay

- [01:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6598) okay [Music]

- [01:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6600) [Music] anyway i won't delve into that that's

- [01:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6602) anyway i won't delve into that that's much advanced

- [01:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6604) much advanced stuff there is thus a trade-off here

- [01:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6608) stuff there is thus a trade-off here you can find various pieces of advice

- [01:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6610) you can find various pieces of advice about the maximum recommended size of a

- [01:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6612) about the maximum recommended size of a struct

- [01:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6613) struct but i would not get caught up on the

- [01:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6615) but i would not get caught up on the exact number

- [01:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6616) exact number in most cases you will want to keep

- [01:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6618) in most cases you will want to keep struct sizes very small

- [01:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6620) struct sizes very small especially if they are passed around but

- [01:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6622) especially if they are passed around but you can also pass structs by reference

- [01:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6624) you can also pass structs by reference so the size may not be an important

- [01:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6625) so the size may not be an important issue to you

- [01:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6627) issue to you so if you pass them as a reference then

- [01:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6630) so if you pass them as a reference then it won't be

- [01:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6631) it won't be cop it won't generate a new instance it

- [01:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6633) cop it won't generate a new instance it will be behaved like a class instance

- [01:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6636) will be behaved like a class instance okay

- [01:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6637) okay this is not the topic of next semester

- [01:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6640) this is not the topic of next semester uh so don't worry about that i think i will

- [01:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6643) so don't worry about that i think i will just take

- [01:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6644) just take a note to my

- [01:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6653) um previous semesters

- [01:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6659) [Music] and use object oriented

- [01:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6665) and use object oriented okay

- [01:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6672) watch it's i don't push okay

- [01:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6677) push okay explain in details i am

- [01:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6687) i'm not sure maybe i have shown that i don't remember right now

- [01:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6689) don't remember right now if i didn't show in the previous

- [01:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6692) if i didn't show in the previous semesters

- [01:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6693) semesters the only way to know for sure whether it

- [01:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6695) the only way to know for sure whether it benefits you is to consider your usage

- [01:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6697) benefits you is to consider your usage pattern and do your own profiling okay so if you

- [01:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6700) and do your own profiling okay so if you are passing

- [01:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6701) are passing a lot of objects between methods

- [01:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6706) a lot of objects between methods and then you may need to have

- [01:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6709) and then you may need to have class instance or if you don't need you

- [01:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6711) class instance or if you don't need you may need to have struck instance

- [01:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6714) may need to have struck instance you will understand this better as you

- [01:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6716) you will understand this better as you get more professional on ccr programming

- [01:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6719) get more professional on ccr programming believe me that

- [01:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6720) believe me that so let's also see their constructors

- [01:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6730) what is their constructor we already have we already know

- [01:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6732) have we already know constructors so let's see they

- [01:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6734) constructors so let's see they constructed as well

- [01:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6741) destructor actually now that not the constructors

- [01:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6743) constructors finalizers which are also called

- [01:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6745) finalizers which are also called destructors are used to perform any

- [01:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6747) destructors are used to perform any necessary final cleanup when a class

- [01:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6749) necessary final cleanup when a class instance is being collected by the

- [01:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6751) instance is being collected by the garbage collector

- [01:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6753) garbage collector remarks finalizers cannot be defined in

- [01:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6757) remarks finalizers cannot be defined in structs

- [01:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6758) structs they are only used with classes a class

- [01:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6762) they are only used with classes a class can only have one finalizer

- [01:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6765) can only have one finalizer finalizers cannot be inherited or

- [01:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6767) finalizers cannot be inherited or overloaded

- [01:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6769) overloaded finalizers cannot be called they are

- [01:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6772) finalizers cannot be called they are invoked automatically

- [01:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6774) invoked automatically a finalizer does not take modifiers or

- [01:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6777) a finalizer does not take modifiers or have parameters

- [01:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6778) have parameters okay like this for example

- [01:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6782) okay like this for example yeah let's uh write a finalizer

- [01:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6786) yeah let's uh write a finalizer and see what is happening

- [01:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6794) so for my uh i see students not always destruct we can't define a finalizer

- [01:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6796) destruct we can't define a finalizer that for my cs tam

- [01:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6797) that for my cs tam yeah i will define a finalizer like this

- [01:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6801) yeah i will define a finalizer like this cstamp so these will be our finalizers

- [01:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6804) cstamp so these will be our finalizers they cannot take any parameters so they

- [01:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6807) they cannot take any parameters so they will be like this

- [01:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6808) will be like this and console.writeline okay

- [01:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6812) and console.writeline okay uh this cstamp

- [01:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6815) uh this cstamp object okay is being

- [01:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6819) object okay is being garbage collected

- [01:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6822) garbage collected by okay so this is a finalizer

- [01:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6827) by okay so this is a finalizer this is a finalizer or

- [01:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6831) this is a finalizer or as known as the extractors

- [01:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6841) let's run the application uh currently do we call it no let's just

- [01:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6844) do we call it no let's just call it somewhere here

- [01:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6849) call it somewhere here i will call it here pg

- [01:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6853) i will call it here pg equal to name

- [01:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6855) equal to name [Music]

- [01:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6856) [Music] and that's it yeah and then i will

- [01:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6859) and that's it yeah and then i will set it to know here

- [01:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6863) set it to know here this and see what happens

- [01:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6878) okay so you see we didn't see the print message because uh it didn't take

- [01:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6882) message because uh it didn't take time uh it didn't uh

- [01:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6885) time uh it didn't uh actually the program didn't run enough

- [01:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6887) actually the program didn't run enough to garbage collect

- [01:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6889) to garbage collect so let's call gc collect

- [01:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6893) so let's call gc collect okay now let's see what happens before

- [01:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6896) okay now let's see what happens before the application ends

- [01:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6904) okay we still don't see it so let's add some [Music]

- [01:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6907) [Music] while loop here as

- [01:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6911) while loop here as system that's training that

- [01:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6914) system that's training that sleep so the application won't end

- [01:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6919) sleep so the application won't end let's see now what happens

- [01:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6926) okay it says that oil true yet so the application will never end

- [01:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6936) okay still we don't see garbage collection

- [01:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6947) this is an inline method we already seen that

- [01:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6981) okay but why if you don't see the message maybe we need to use

- [01:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6985) the message maybe we need to use garbage conductor any everywhere

- [01:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=6989) garbage conductor any everywhere so this is the finalizers

- [01:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=7007) okay so we are collecting garbage collecting but

- [01:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=7009) collecting but it is not getting finalized interesting

- [01:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=7024) okay so what why do we need to use that okay

- [01:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=7031) the programmer has no control over when the finalizer is called

- [01:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=7032) the finalizer is called the garbage collector decides when to

- [01:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=7034) the garbage collector decides when to call it

- [01:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=7036) call it the garbage collector checks for objects

- [01:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=7038) the garbage collector checks for objects that are no longer being used by the

- [01:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=7039) that are no longer being used by the application

- [01:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=7041) application if it considers an object eligible for

- [01:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=7043) if it considers an object eligible for finalization

- [01:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=7044) finalization it calls the finalizer if any and

- [01:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=7046) it calls the finalizer if any and reclaims the memory used to store the

- [01:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=7048) reclaims the memory used to store the object

- [01:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=7050) object in dot net framework applications but

- [01:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=7052) in dot net framework applications but not in net core applications

- [01:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=7054) not in net core applications finalizers are also called when the

- [01:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=7056) finalizers are also called when the program exits

- [01:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=7058) program exits it's possible to force garbage

- [01:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=7060) it's possible to force garbage collection by calling collect

- [01:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=7061) collection by calling collect but most of the time this call should be

- [01:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=7064) but most of the time this call should be avoided because it may create

- [01:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=7065) avoided because it may create performance issues

- [01:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=7067) performance issues okay so i have another idea to trigger

- [01:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=7070) okay so i have another idea to trigger it

- [01:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=7071) it let me show you

- [01:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=7080) okay so instead of this [Music]

- [01:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=7081) [Music] i will just generate an instance of this

- [01:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=7084) i will just generate an instance of this class

- [01:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=7086) class like this and

- [01:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=7088) like this and [Music]

- [01:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=7090) [Music] let's also assign a value to it

- [01:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=7093) let's also assign a value to it for this class her peak definition

- [01:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=7098) for this class her peak definition my property here my property

- [01:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=7107) and all i also need to initialize it like this

- [01:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=7109) like this equals something like this and something

- [01:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=7112) equals something like this and something like this

- [01:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=7114) like this so let's see what happens now after a

- [01:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=7116) so let's see what happens now after a while it has to

- [01:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=7118) while it has to collect a garbage collector because it

- [01:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=7121) collect a garbage collector because it will become too big

- [01:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=7123) will become too big and then we should we see that

- [01:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=7126) and then we should we see that let's see how much memory we are taking

- [01:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=7128) let's see how much memory we are taking oh we are still too slow

- [01:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=7130) oh we are still too slow so let's increase the speed with

- [01:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=7135) so let's increase the speed with one millisecond

- [01:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=7144) and let's check the memory okay we are still not much music memory

- [01:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=7147) still not much music memory so it is still not

- [01:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=7150) so it is still not calling garbage collectors

- [01:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=7158) yeah the memory is not increasing so let's remove trading sleep

- [01:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=7162) so let's remove trading sleep and let's run application i hope it

- [01:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=7163) and let's run application i hope it won't crash

- [01:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=7170) yeah yeah i just saw that okay here you see

- [01:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=7171) see it is being garbage collected now we

- [01:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=7174) it is being garbage collected now we have triggered

- [01:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=7174) have triggered the garbage collector because it did

- [01:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=7177) the garbage collector because it did just

- [01:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=7178) just fill it the memory instantly

- [01:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=7182) fill it the memory instantly and yeah okay so we have

- [01:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=7185) and yeah okay so we have seen uh the structure of finalizers

- [01:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=7194) and how can it use it what is class finalizers also called

- [02:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=7220) all right and enough dynamic types

- [02:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=7233) okay now time to see dynamic types and then generate types

- [02:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=7262) c sharp dynamic types c sharp 4.0 dot net 4.5

- [02:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=7266) sharp 4.0 dot net 4.5 introduced a new type called dynamic

- [02:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=7267) introduced a new type called dynamic that avoids compile-time type checking

- [02:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=7270) that avoids compile-time type checking a dynamic type escapes type checking at

- [02:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=7273) a dynamic type escapes type checking at compile time

- [02:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=7274) compile time instead it resolves type at runtime

- [02:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=7277) instead it resolves type at runtime a dynamic type variables are defined

- [02:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=7280) a dynamic type variables are defined using the dynamic keyword

- [02:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=7282) using the dynamic keyword okay an example is like this the

- [02:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=7284) okay an example is like this the compiler compiles dynamic types into

- [02:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=7286) compiler compiles dynamic types into object types in most cases

- [02:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=7288) object types in most cases however the actual type of a dynamic

- [02:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=7290) however the actual type of a dynamic variable

- [02:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=7291) variable dynamic type variable would result at

- [02:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=7294) dynamic type variable would result at dynamic type

- [02:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=7296) dynamic type okay something like this let's check it

- [02:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=7298) okay something like this let's check it out

- [02:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=7300) out so first

- [02:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=7325) but since we made this we didn't make it so let's also change this to a

- [02:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=7329) so let's also change this to a for loop with like

- [02:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=7332) for loop with like something like this

- [02:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=7349) so it won't be forever let's make it like

- [02:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=7351) like this and let's run to see if it is

- [02:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=7354) this and let's run to see if it is working

- [02:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=7385) okay it's working let's close it and now time to uh make example of

- [02:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=7389) and now time to uh make example of dynamic type

- [02:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=7390) dynamic type like this dynamic however it will be

- [02:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=7393) like this dynamic however it will be resolvable to

- [02:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=7395) resolvable to integers so i will also show another

- [02:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=7398) integers so i will also show another example

- [02:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=7399) example as this and let's see that

- [02:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=7409) okay so the first one will be integer and the second one is

- [02:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=7411) and the second one is lock okay we can also directly

- [02:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=7414) lock okay we can also directly uh type them like this

- [02:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=7424) okay to string or it can't be typed as to string so it will be dynamically

- [02:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=7426) to string so it will be dynamically results

- [02:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=7434) let's make this something like this and this something like this

- [02:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=7446) okay they are typed okay let's continue

- [02:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=7449) okay let's continue dynamic types change types at runtime

- [02:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=7451) dynamic types change types at runtime based on the assigned value

- [02:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=7453) based on the assigned value the following example shows how a

- [02:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=7455) the following example shows how a dynamic variable changes type based on

- [02:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=7457) dynamic variable changes type based on assigned value

- [02:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=7458) assigned value okay so uc dynamic type can change

- [02:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=7463) okay so uc dynamic type can change value at runtime like this

- [02:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=7467) value at runtime like this so with a single variable name we are

- [02:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=7470) so with a single variable name we are able to get

- [02:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=7472) able to get different types of values

- [02:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=7476) different types of values like this

- [02:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=7490) you see first it becomes integer then it becomes string then it becomes boolean

- [02:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=7492) becomes string then it becomes boolean and then it becomes data

- [02:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=7495) and then it becomes data okay

- [02:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=7502) the dynamic type variables is converted to other types implicitly

- [02:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=7504) to other types implicitly right here's

- [02:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=7511) okay methods and parameters if you assign a class object to the

- [02:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=7513) if you assign a class object to the dynamic type then the compiler would not

- [02:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=7515) dynamic type then the compiler would not check for correct methods and properties

- [02:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=7517) check for correct methods and properties name of a dynamic type that holds the

- [02:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=7519) name of a dynamic type that holds the custom class object

- [02:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=7521) custom class object consider the following example okay so

- [02:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=7524) consider the following example okay so we have

- [02:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=7525) we have public class students we already have

- [02:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=7528) public class students we already have this so i need to change this to a

- [02:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=7530) this so i need to change this to a student x okay

- [02:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=7534) student x okay and let's

- [02:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=7537) and let's define an example like dynamic

- [02:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=7540) define an example like dynamic student x like this and then

- [02:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=7549) okay so there is no such thing because uh it is not checking a trend uh compile

- [02:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=7552) uh it is not checking a trend uh compile time

- [02:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=7554) time uh it will uh throw compil

- [02:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=7557) uh it will uh throw compil uh runtime errors why because

- [02:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=7560) uh runtime errors why because uh it doesn't have a method that

- [02:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=7563) uh it doesn't have a method that includes uh it

- [02:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=7567) includes uh it the class doesn't have these named

- [02:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=7569) the class doesn't have these named methods actually it has this name it

- [02:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=7571) methods actually it has this name it method but

- [02:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=7572) method but it doesn't have method that takes

- [02:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=7576) it doesn't have method that takes integer and c string signatures or

- [02:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=7579) integer and c string signatures or string signatures or

- [02:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=7580) string signatures or some fake method so they will drop error

- [02:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=7583) some fake method so they will drop error in

- [02:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=7584) in runtime so you see using dynamic types

- [02:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=7587) runtime so you see using dynamic types is a little bit of dangerous because no

- [02:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=7591) is a little bit of dangerous because no compile time checking

- [02:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=7601) in the above example the c-sharp compiler does not check for the number

- [02:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=7603) compiler does not check for the number of parameters

- [02:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=7604) of parameters parameters type or non-existent it

- [02:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=7607) parameters type or non-existent it validates these things at runtime

- [02:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=7609) validates these things at runtime and if it is not valid then throws a

- [02:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=7611) and if it is not valid then throws a runtime exception

- [02:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=7613) runtime exception note that visual studio intellisense is

- [02:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=7616) note that visual studio intellisense is not supported for the dynamic types

- [02:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=7619) not supported for the dynamic types note that visual studio intelligence is

- [02:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=7621) note that visual studio intelligence is double time

- [02:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=7622) double time so when we should i use dynamic times

- [02:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=7624) so when we should i use dynamic times one

- [02:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=7625) one use dynamic type

- [02:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=7628) use dynamic type in c sharp let's see

- [02:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=7632) in c sharp let's see when should we use it

- [02:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=7646) when should we use it but why we should use it

- [02:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=7689) okay so let's create this answer dynamic should be used only when

- [02:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=7693) answer dynamic should be used only when not using it is painful

- [02:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=7695) not using it is painful like in ms office libraries in all other

- [02:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=7699) like in ms office libraries in all other cases it should be avoided as compile

- [02:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=7701) cases it should be avoided as compile type checking is beneficial following are the

- [02:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=7704) checking is beneficial following are the good situation of using dynamic

- [02:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=7707) good situation of using dynamic calling javascript method from

- [02:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=7709) calling javascript method from silverlight

- [02:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=7711) silverlight com interrupt may be reading xml

- [02:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=7714) com interrupt may be reading xml json without creating custom classes

- [02:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=7749) okay so there is a good example here like we have some interface is same data

- [02:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=7752) like we have some interface is same data then we have two classes which uh

- [02:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=7756) then we have two classes which uh use this as interface then we have some

- [02:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=7760) use this as interface then we have some do something

- [02:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=7762) do something so based on the case

- [02:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=7765) so based on the case [Music]

- [02:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=7768) [Music] we can use dynamics

- [02:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=7771) we can use dynamics and this is a really wild example

- [02:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=7775) and this is a really wild example without so much specification

- [02:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=7787) without so much specification okay this is rather advanced topic as

- [02:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=7789) okay this is rather advanced topic as you become more

- [02:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=7790) you become more expert in c sharp you will understand it

- [02:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=7793) expert in c sharp you will understand it better

- [02:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=7794) better so you should avoid using dynamic for

- [02:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=7797) so you should avoid using dynamic for now

- [02:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=7798) now nine inch type objects

- [02:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=7801) nine inch type objects and how to use dynamic

- [02:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=7805) and how to use dynamic type okay now we get into generics

- [02:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=7809) type okay now we get into generics it is really important and it is

- [02:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=7812) it is really important and it is very commonly used

- [02:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=7821) genetics okay so generics is really important

- [02:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=7822) important therefore you should pay more attention

- [02:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=7824) therefore you should pay more attention to this

- [02:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=7829) to this c sharp generics generic means the

- [02:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=7832) c sharp generics generic means the general form

- [02:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=7833) general form not specific in c sharp generic means

- [02:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=7836) not specific in c sharp generic means not specific to a particular data type

- [02:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=7839) not specific to a particular data type yeah this is the answer it is not

- [02:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=7841) yeah this is the answer it is not specific to a particular data type so it

- [02:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=7843) specific to a particular data type so it can be used with multiple different

- [02:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=7845) can be used with multiple different types

- [02:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=7846) types okay

- [02:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=7851) c-sharp allows you to define generic classes interfaces

- [02:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=7853) classes interfaces abstract classes fields methods static

- [02:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=7856) abstract classes fields methods static methods

- [02:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=7857) methods properties events delegates and

- [02:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=7859) properties events delegates and operators using the type parameter and

- [02:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=7861) operators using the type parameter and without the specific data type

- [02:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=7863) without the specific data type a type parameter is a placeholder for a

- [02:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=7865) a type parameter is a placeholder for a particular type specified when creating

- [02:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=7867) particular type specified when creating an instance of the generic type

- [02:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=7870) an instance of the generic type a generic type is declared by specifying

- [02:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=7873) a generic type is declared by specifying a type parameter in an angle brackets

- [02:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=7875) a type parameter in an angle brackets after a type name eg type name t where t

- [02:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=7878) after a type name eg type name t where t is a type parameter

- [02:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=7880) is a type parameter okay so let's make a

- [02:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=7885) okay so let's make a an easy example so let's take this into

- [02:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=7888) an easy example so let's take this into part 4.

- [02:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=7899) part 4. okay so

- [02:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=7902) okay so let's assume that we want to

- [02:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=7905) let's assume that we want to generate a method

- [02:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=7908) generate a method that can multiply uh

- [02:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=7913) that can multiply uh different value types okay

- [02:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=7917) different value types okay so public static

- [02:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=7921) so public static t is for the return t multiply

- [02:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=7931) uh okay it will take this dot t

- [02:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=7938) actually to make it uh like this i have to

- [02:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=7940) to use it like this

- [02:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=7954) now t dot

- [02:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=7959) i think i need to add generics or something perhaps

- [02:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=7968) something perhaps no generics so let's see

- [02:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=8008) so where do we make oh i see to be able to define a public method

- [02:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=8011) to be able to define a public method like this you have to define a class

- [02:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=8013) like this you have to define a class first probably class i just remembered that so

- [02:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=8016) probably class i just remembered that so it will be like this

- [02:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=8018) it will be like this t

- [02:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=8026) and inside this class we can use a method like that so public class

- [02:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=8036) let's say a custom class or let's say

- [02:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=8042) custom class and it will be type of t like this

- [02:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=8044) like this and then uh we can have

- [02:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=8051) uh multiply like this yeah yeah now it'll work

- [02:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=8053) it'll work so what will this do is it will just

- [02:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=8057) so what will this do is it will just uh return one year

- [02:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=8061) uh return one year and value like this yeah

- [02:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=8065) and value like this yeah okay so

- [02:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=8067) okay so [Music]

- [02:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=8073) okay there is no operator like that so what else can we do

- [02:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=8101) we need operator overloading for this probably

- [02:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=8108) but since this generic i have to tell that this operand is

- [02:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=8110) have to tell that this operand is supported

- [02:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=8112) supported so i need to

- [02:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=8117) so i need to add a constraint to this okay um

- [02:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=8136) okay c sharp modular type constrained to generic

- [02:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=8150) i can't remember the constraint so there is very keyboard yeah

- [02:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=8177) maybe no maybe volume type when you tap on no maybe

- [02:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=8180) when you tap on no maybe when you type now does it support

- [02:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=8185) when you type now does it support no maybe we can tell integers

- [02:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=8220) and maybe we need to employ this where t system are comparable

- [02:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=8248) okay multiply operator supported type c sharp

- [02:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=8256) okay okay someone has asked that so what is the constraint for that

- [02:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=8260) so what is the constraint for that is

- [02:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=8270) integral yeah integral it means that this will be a number

- [02:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=8273) this will be a number and now for integral

- [02:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=8277) and now for integral no i

- [02:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=8280) no i arithmetic very well

- [02:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=8304) also an answers and okay so why do we still have

- [02:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=8309) and okay so why do we still have an equitable

- [02:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=8318) an equitable okay still not this

- [02:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=8332) okay still not this there is no current support in that net

- [02:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=8334) there is no current support in that net generation indicated operators are

- [02:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=8335) generation indicated operators are supported oh

- [02:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=8336) supported oh okay i see so this is not supported

- [02:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=8340) okay i see so this is not supported we have started with a some

- [02:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=8343) we have started with a some [Music]

- [02:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=8345) [Music] harder example so let's follow uh

- [02:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=8348) harder example so let's follow uh the artifact here

- [02:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=8352) the artifact here i think so let's start with the

- [02:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=8355) i think so let's start with the class 30. okay just ignore this

- [02:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=8359) class 30. okay just ignore this so cluster t means that

- [02:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=8363) so cluster t means that there is a class which takes any type

- [02:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=8365) there is a class which takes any type type

- [02:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=8367) type and it has that type of data

- [02:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=8370) and it has that type of data okay so uh let's

- [02:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=8374) okay so uh let's continue reading

- [02:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=8382) above the data store is a generic class t is called type parameter which can be

- [02:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=8384) t is called type parameter which can be used as a type of fields

- [02:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=8386) used as a type of fields properties method parameters return

- [02:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=8388) properties method parameters return types and delegates in the data store

- [02:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=8390) types and delegates in the data store class

- [02:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=8391) class for example data is generic property

- [02:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=8394) for example data is generic property because we have used a type parameter t

- [02:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=8396) because we have used a type parameter t as its type instead of the specific data

- [02:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=8406) it is not required to use t as a type parameter

- [02:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=8408) parameter you can give any name to a type

- [02:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=8409) you can give any name to a type parameter

- [02:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=8411) parameter generally t is used when there is only

- [02:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=8413) generally t is used when there is only one type parameter

- [02:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=8415) one type parameter it is recommended to use a more readable

- [02:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=8417) it is recommended to use a more readable type parameter name as per requirement

- [02:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=8419) type parameter name as per requirement like t session t t value etc

- [02:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=8422) session t t value etc learn more about type parameter naming

- [02:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=8424) learn more about type parameter naming guidelines

- [02:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=8426) guidelines okay so we can also

- [02:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=8430) okay so we can also generate another class like this

- [02:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=8434) generate another class like this key value appear t t value s so it can

- [02:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=8437) key value appear t t value s so it can be anything

- [02:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=8438) be anything actually this is the

- [02:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=8440) actually this is the [Music]

- [02:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=8442) [Music] general activity okay

- [02:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=8445) general activity okay and now let's initiate instance

- [02:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=8449) and now let's initiate instance instantiate a generic class

- [02:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=8452) instantiate a generic class connect uh typo so you see this is

- [02:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=8455) connect uh typo so you see this is datastore

- [02:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=8456) datastore but it is from string type so that

- [02:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=8460) but it is from string type so that now this class can hold data as string

- [02:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=8463) now this class can hold data as string such as okay such example

- [02:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=8468) such as okay such example then i can use console writeline to

- [02:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=8471) then i can use console writeline to print that

- [02:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=8472) print that and store the data okay

- [02:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=8475) and store the data okay since it is string type it will work

- [02:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=8488) okay however once we define it it's type then we can't change its type

- [02:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=8491) it's type then we can't change its type like this

- [02:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=8493) like this uh because it will tell me that uh

- [02:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=8495) uh because it will tell me that uh cannot convert type integer to string

- [02:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=8498) cannot convert type integer to string therefore you cannot change its type

- [02:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=8501) therefore you cannot change its type upon it is defined

- [02:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=8504) upon it is defined so this is how we defined it

- [02:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=8511) you can create an instance of generic classes by specifying an actual type and

- [02:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=8514) classes by specifying an actual type and angle brackets

- [02:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=8516) angle brackets the following creates an instance of the

- [02:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=8517) the following creates an instance of the generic class data store

- [02:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=8525) above we specified the string type in the angle brackets while creating an

- [02:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=8527) the angle brackets while creating an instance

- [02:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=8528) instance so t will be replaced with a string type

- [02:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=8531) so t will be replaced with a string type wherever t is used in the entire class

- [02:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=8533) wherever t is used in the entire class at compile time

- [02:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=8535) at compile time therefore the type of data property

- [02:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=8537) therefore the type of data property would be a string

- [02:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=8538) would be a string so you see it is called it is converted

- [02:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=8541) so you see it is called it is converted at the compile time therefore it is

- [02:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=8543) at the compile time therefore it is compile time

- [02:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=8544) compile time check it and verify it it is not like

- [02:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=8546) check it and verify it it is not like dynamic

- [02:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=8547) dynamic you can assign a string value to the

- [02:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=8549) you can assign a string value to the data property

- [02:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=8551) data property trying to assign values other than

- [02:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=8553) trying to assign values other than string will result in a compile time

- [02:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=8555) string will result in a compile time error

- [02:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=8555) error yeah this will uh throw an error

- [02:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=8559) yeah this will uh throw an error so let's also add this

- [02:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=8582) you can specify the different data types for different objects as shown below

- [02:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=8585) for different objects as shown below so you see with single uh class we are

- [02:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=8588) so you see with single uh class we are able to

- [02:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=8589) able to define different types of objects like

- [02:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=8591) define different types of objects like this

- [02:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=8592) this data source sync data store integer data

- [02:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=8595) data source sync data store integer data store key

- [02:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=8596) store key key value appear integer string key

- [02:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=8598) key value appear integer string key value page string string

- [02:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=8600) value page string string whatever we want we can define

- [02:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=8603) whatever we want we can define different types of objects with

- [02:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=8607) different types of objects with generics like this

- [02:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=8610) generics like this okay here it is storing they are all

- [02:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=8613) okay here it is storing they are all datastore class

- [02:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=8615) datastore class but different types as you can see

- [02:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=8626) okay generic class characteristics

- [02:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=8629) generic class characteristics a generic class increases the

- [02:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=8631) a generic class increases the reusability

- [02:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=8632) reusability the more type parameters mean more

- [02:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=8634) the more type parameters mean more reusable it becomes

- [02:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=8636) reusable it becomes however too much generalization makes

- [02:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=8639) however too much generalization makes code difficult to understand

- [02:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=8640) code difficult to understand and maintain a generic class can be a

- [02:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=8644) and maintain a generic class can be a base class to other generic or

- [02:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=8645) base class to other generic or non-generic classes

- [02:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=8647) non-generic classes or abstract classes a generic class can

- [02:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=8651) or abstract classes a generic class can be derived from other generic or

- [02:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=8652) be derived from other generic or non-generic interfaces

- [02:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=8654) non-generic interfaces classes or abstract classes we will

- [02:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=8657) classes or abstract classes we will learn more about

- [02:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=8658) learn more about abstraction interfaces or

- [02:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=8667) inheritance at the next semester in object-oriented programming

- [02:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=8674) generic fields a generic class can include generic fields

- [02:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=8676) include generic fields however it cannot be initialized also

- [02:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=8679) however it cannot be initialized also generic methods are always defined

- [02:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=8682) generic methods are always defined inside generic classes

- [02:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=8686) inside generic classes that's important

- [02:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=8693) so we can have genetic array as well like this

- [02:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=8693) like this in the genetic array so it will hold

- [02:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=8696) in the genetic array so it will hold data type of t

- [02:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=8698) data type of t like this for example um

- [02:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=8701) like this for example um data store

- [02:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=8711) and the type will be let's say long okay and they data name

- [02:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=8715) and they data name data so long and inside here i can

- [02:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=8718) data so long and inside here i can define

- [02:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=8718) define data as by the way let's give different

- [02:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=8721) data as by the way let's give different names as

- [02:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=8723) names as data early

- [02:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=8729) data will be something like this and the data array

- [02:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=8730) data array will be

- [02:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=8731) will be [Music]

- [02:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=8734) [Music] long like

- [02:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=8739) long like this okay

- [02:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=8752) i think since the early i have to define it like this

- [02:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=8778) yeah and now i can print to screen the data array of ld data

- [02:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=8790) straight line right it will print this to the screen

- [02:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=8794) this to the screen you see it's a generic type in other

- [02:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=8796) you see it's a generic type in other case this can be string

- [02:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=8797) case this can be string or object whatever i want because it's a

- [02:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=8801) or object whatever i want because it's a generic type

- [02:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=8803) generic type and then we can have generic methods

- [02:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=8806) and then we can have generic methods generic methods

- [02:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=8808) generic methods a method declared with the type

- [02:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=8810) a method declared with the type parameters for its return type or

- [02:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=8812) parameters for its return type or parameters

- [02:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=8812) parameters is called a generic method like this

- [02:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=8815) is called a generic method like this and or updates so it inserts

- [02:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=8819) and or updates so it inserts an item to the

- [02:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=8822) an item to the list or resource an item from list like

- [02:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=8825) list or resource an item from list like this

- [02:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=8835) so add or update field adds data to let's also define an another instance of

- [02:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=8837) let's also define an another instance of data this will be private so

- [02:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=8839) data this will be private so won't be accessible by uh

- [02:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=8842) won't be accessible by uh other methods or classes private

- [02:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=8846) other methods or classes private t data and now i can

- [02:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=8850) t data and now i can add or update like adds updates

- [02:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=8855) add or update like adds updates it requires an index

- [02:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=8858) it requires an index and a long item by the way when we don't

- [02:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=8861) and a long item by the way when we don't have such index what it is gonna do

- [02:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=8875) assign data then we can also use get data as well to get data

- [02:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=8904) okay it is working so this is generic methods

- [02:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=8910) above the adder update and the get data methods are generic methods

- [02:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=8913) methods are generic methods the actual data type of the item

- [02:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=8914) the actual data type of the item parameter will be specified at the time

- [02:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=8916) parameter will be specified at the time of instantiating the datastore t

- [02:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=8918) of instantiating the datastore t class as shown below

- [02:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=8922) class as shown below okay so let's continue

- [02:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=8929) the generic parameter type can be used with multiple parameters with or without

- [02:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=8931) with multiple parameters with or without non-generic parameters and return

- [02:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=8933) non-generic parameters and return type the followings are valid generic

- [02:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=8936) type the followings are valid generic method overloading

- [02:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=8938) method overloading yeah let's copy and paste them into our

- [02:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=8941) yeah let's copy and paste them into our class

- [02:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=8943) class okay like yes

- [02:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=8946) okay like yes so you can mix strong type uh

- [02:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=8949) so you can mix strong type uh strong type it with generic type

- [02:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=8953) strong type it with generic type like editor update index c data we

- [02:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=8955) like editor update index c data we already have that so we have to remove

- [02:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=8957) already have that so we have to remove it

- [02:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=8958) it and these are other overloaded so

- [02:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=8961) and these are other overloaded so generic generic

- [02:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=8962) generic generic or this means that

- [02:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=8965) or this means that one generic and another generative

- [02:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=8967) one generic and another generative difference

- [02:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=8969) difference like this or this

- [02:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=8976) okay so now it says that it is ambiguous with

- [02:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=8983) this or this therefore what can we do

- [02:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=8990) therefore what can we do okay this is being ambiguous therefore

- [02:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=8992) okay this is being ambiguous therefore we need to change

- [02:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=8995) we need to change [Music]

- [02:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=9004) okay for example this will be integer and this will be long

- [02:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=9006) and this will be long then it will work yeah you see since it

- [02:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=9009) then it will work yeah you see since it is checking at compile time

- [02:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=9012) is checking at compile time uh this will get into this

- [02:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=9016) uh this will get into this why because this one takes in

- [02:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=9019) why because this one takes in intent long

- [02:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=9023) intent long i mean generic

- [02:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=9026) i mean generic yeah yeah this will get into this

- [02:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=9030) yeah yeah this will get into this and if i make it something like this

- [02:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=9034) and if i make it something like this let me show you what i mean so console

- [02:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=9037) let me show you what i mean so console right time

- [02:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=9040) right time okay first add our updates

- [02:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=9047) okay first add our updates and here's

- [02:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=9058) okay second header update and here third and update

- [02:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=9062) third and update so this will call

- [02:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=9065) so this will call the first this will call

- [02:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=9070) the first this will call first header update and now i will

- [02:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=9073) first header update and now i will change this to obj double

- [02:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=9077) change this to obj double this will call

- [02:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=9088) why not working [Music]

- [02:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=9095) oh they have to be from same type so let's make it something like this

- [02:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=9098) let's make it something like this t type and t type

- [02:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=9112) well i know the reason since we have defined it here as long

- [02:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=9113) defined it here as long so they have to vote long like this

- [02:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=9117) so they have to vote long like this and this

- [02:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=9121) and this i don't even need to put to second front

- [02:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=9123) i don't even need to put to second front oh i need to push

- [02:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=9125) oh i need to push probably and then

- [02:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=9128) probably and then let's make another instance for third

- [02:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=9131) let's make another instance for third so this will take another type like

- [02:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=9133) so this will take another type like double

- [02:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=9135) double so now it will expect me

- [02:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=9139) so now it will expect me first long and the second one will be

- [02:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=9141) first long and the second one will be double like this

- [02:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=9143) double like this this will call the chart okay

- [02:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=9147) this will call the chart okay let's run the application to see

- [02:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=9150) let's run the application to see first editor update second editor update

- [02:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=9152) first editor update second editor update and third editor

- [02:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=9154) and third editor update and this is how you can mix

- [02:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=9159) update and this is how you can mix different type of

- [02:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=9161) different type of generics yeah

- [02:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=9164) generics yeah it's already displayed here

- [02:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=9171) so the console.writeline also supports generic as well

- [02:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=9173) generic as well and therefore this is valid let's also

- [02:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=9176) and therefore this is valid let's also add it to our example

- [02:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=9179) add it to our example like here a printer class

- [02:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=9183) like here a printer class and different type of prints

- [02:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=9197) oh i have put this in correct place it will be inside here

- [02:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=9199) will be inside here you see first it will print integer then

- [02:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=9202) you see first it will print integer then it will print

- [02:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=9203) it will print integers then it will print string then

- [02:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=9206) integers then it will print string then it will okay both of them will

- [02:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=9211) print string okay both of them will work because it has this kind of

- [02:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=9216) work because it has this kind of print methods okay

- [02:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=9221) print methods okay so border of both of them is working

- [02:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=9231) advantages of generics generics increase the reusability of the code

- [02:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=9233) the reusability of the code you don't need to write code to handle

- [02:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=9235) you don't need to write code to handle different data types

- [02:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=9238) different data types generics are type safe you get compile

- [02:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=9241) generics are type safe you get compile time errors

- [02:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=9241) time errors if you try to use a different data type

- [02:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=9243) if you try to use a different data type than the one specified in the definition

- [02:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=9247) than the one specified in the definition generic has a performance advantage

- [02:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=9249) generic has a performance advantage because it removes the possibilities of

- [02:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=9250) because it removes the possibilities of boxing

- [02:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=9251) boxing and unboxing okay

- [02:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=9255) and unboxing okay what are genetics how to

- [02:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=9259) what are genetics how to define genetics using classes

- [02:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=9262) define genetics using classes and methods what are the

- [02:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=9267) and methods what are the advantages of

- [02:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=9269) advantages of genetics

- [02:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=9279) genetics now we are going to use a restriction

- [02:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=9280) restriction of genetics i'm constrained how

- [02:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=9284) of genetics i'm constrained how to reset generated

- [02:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=9287) to reset generated constraints okay

- [02:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=9291) constraints okay so now

- [02:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=9299) let's make constraint on generics

- [02:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=9341) so let's start with an easy one data store 2 okay i'm going to use

- [02:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=9345) one data store 2 okay i'm going to use data store 2

- [02:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=9352) okay v2 actually so i'm going to add a constraint as

- [02:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=9354) constraint as bash

- [02:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=9355) bash [Music]

- [02:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=9358) [Music] t is integers

- [02:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=9367) and double so here we can only define

- [02:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=9370) here we can only define data store 2 with integer and double or

- [02:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=9373) data store 2 with integer and double or by the way it doesn't allow value types

- [02:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=9375) by the way it doesn't allow value types to be

- [02:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=9376) to be constrained

- [02:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=9383) therefore it's it's it has to interface a non-sealed class or

- [02:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=9384) a non-sealed class or a type parameters

- [02:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=9411) then we can i think constrained into value type

- [02:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=9413) value type like this and

- [02:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=9417) like this and oh it doesn't support audio type as well

- [02:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=9439) no not working either system dots i enumerable maybe

- [02:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=9453) okay let's make a system but i know yeah now data store 2 can be

- [02:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=9456) yeah now data store 2 can be only any okay so

- [02:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=9460) only any okay so data store 2 version 2 let's pick an

- [02:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=9463) data store 2 version 2 let's pick an enum

- [02:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=9463) enum like console colors

- [02:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=9467) like console colors yeah my colors it will be like this

- [02:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=9472) yeah my colors it will be like this this console color and elimination type

- [02:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=9474) this console color and elimination type yes

- [02:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=9475) yes so here i have defined it a type of

- [02:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=9478) so here i have defined it a type of console color

- [02:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=9480) console color then i can set console color data to

- [02:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=9485) then i can set console color data to like this then let's define another

- [02:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=9488) like this then let's define another enumeration

- [02:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=9489) enumeration so can i define my data store tool like

- [02:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=9492) so can i define my data store tool like this now

- [02:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=9495) this now no because it will tell me that the type

- [02:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=9497) no because it will tell me that the type string cannot be used as star

- [02:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=9499) string cannot be used as star type parameter t in the generic type or

- [02:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=9501) type parameter t in the generic type or method

- [02:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=9502) method there is no implicit inference in

- [02:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=9505) there is no implicit inference in reference conversation from string to

- [02:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=9509) reference conversation from string to system nm so it has to be either

- [02:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=9511) system nm so it has to be either implicitly convertible

- [02:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=9513) implicitly convertible or enumeration this will draw compiler

- [02:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=9523) error so you can restrict your enumeration to

- [02:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=9526) so you can restrict your enumeration to certain classes like it will be a the

- [02:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=9529) certain classes like it will be a the system enum or my cstamp class

- [02:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=9534) enum or my cstamp class okay so now it will be a load as well

- [02:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=9546) okay so it says that this has to come first like this

- [02:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=9556) um how do we set multiple constraints then

- [02:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=9573) i see so it is like this vertical stamp and verti

- [02:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=9576) and verti system and

- [02:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=9579) system and [Music]

- [02:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=9581) [Music] we put it like this

- [02:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=9589) okay oh no no this is wrong

- [02:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=9592) this is wrong so how do you put multiple constraints

- [02:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=9621) okay so we can't set it like both enumeration and

- [02:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=9622) enumeration and [Music]

- [02:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=9623) [Music] another class it doesn't allow

- [02:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=9627) another class it doesn't allow uh so it can be either enum type

- [02:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=9630) uh so it can be either enum type or my custom class type

- [02:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=9633) or my custom class type like this and this can be

- [02:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=9637) like this and this can be version three so it would only i love

- [02:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=9641) version three so it would only i love this or this wouldn't be very useful of

- [02:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=9645) this or this wouldn't be very useful of course it would

- [02:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=9645) course it would instead of this we would define it as cs

- [02:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=9648) instead of this we would define it as cs time

- [02:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=9649) time so let's try as

- [02:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=9652) so let's try as i animate

- [02:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=9660) okay this is more sense making and now let's try a string

- [02:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=9663) and now let's try a string so it is expecting iron variable

- [02:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=9666) so it is expecting iron variable okay dt3 like this

- [02:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=9677) okay you see it is working because stitching is enumerable as characters

- [02:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=9681) stitching is enumerable as characters and let's write it as integers

- [02:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=9685) and let's write it as integers this is not any variable obviously

- [02:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=9690) this is not any variable obviously so this will draw compile time error

- [02:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=9693) so this will draw compile time error because it says cannot implicitly

- [02:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=9695) because it says cannot implicitly convert type

- [02:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=9697) convert type uh string to

- [02:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=9706) um okay there's no boxing conversation from

- [02:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=9708) there's no boxing conversation from integer to system collections i am

- [02:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=9710) integer to system collections i am a label okay uh this is also compile

- [02:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=9713) a label okay uh this is also compile time errors

- [02:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=9717) time errors let's make another example as

- [02:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=9722) let's make another example as dt5 and let's define

- [02:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=9725) dt5 and let's define an i a new variable like

- [02:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=9729) an i a new variable like integer error okay this should work

- [02:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=9740) and now it is working as you can see okay i can also define it as list

- [02:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=9745) okay i can also define it as list or even dictionary dictionary is also

- [02:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=9747) or even dictionary dictionary is also animated like string string

- [02:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=9756) like this dt6 and the data store

- [02:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=9760) and the data store you see since this is i enumerable

- [02:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=9763) you see since this is i enumerable then it is working all right so

- [02:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=9767) then it is working all right so we have seen generics as well and in

- [02:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=9770) we have seen generics as well and in many methods we see generally such

- [02:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=9772) many methods we see generally such as console.writeline and it takes

- [02:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=9777) as console.writeline and it takes no parameter boolean character character

- [02:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=9779) no parameter boolean character character buffer decimal double

- [02:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=9781) buffer decimal double float integer long object string

- [02:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=9785) float integer long object string you into long

- [02:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=9788) you into long you see actually this doesn't inherit

- [02:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=9792) you see actually this doesn't inherit generic so let's try with

- [02:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=9795) generic so let's try with list and list is you see getting t

- [02:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=9799) list and list is you see getting t t is the type of the element so it is

- [02:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=9801) t is the type of the element so it is supporting generics

- [02:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=9803) supporting generics or dictionary or tuple let's try for

- [02:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=9805) or dictionary or tuple let's try for example tuple

- [02:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=9806) example tuple you see double is also supporting

- [02:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=9808) you see double is also supporting generics

- [02:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=9810) generics and or let's say

- [02:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=9813) and or let's say array for example

- [02:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=9821) but for array we have to define strong time

- [02:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=9822) time so instead let's

- [02:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=9826) so instead let's say hash table for example hey set

- [02:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=9829) say hash table for example hey set you see it's also generic so this is

- [02:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=9832) you see it's also generic so this is what are generics and

- [02:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=9836) what are generics and where they are being used

- [02:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=9842) and you will see a lot of genetics when you work with them so

- [02:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=9846) work with them so an example here

- [02:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=9857) okay let's also make this example so we have public static void

- [02:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=9861) so we have public static void which takes t

- [02:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=9862) which takes t [Music]

- [02:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=9864) [Music] parameter and

- [02:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=9872) where t is a class uh it will just system console.writeline

- [02:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=9875) uh it will just system console.writeline t equal equal t

- [02:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=9878) t equal equal t and then we have a method like this

- [02:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=9881) and then we have a method like this so first one is string and the second

- [02:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=9883) so first one is string and the second one is

- [02:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=9884) one is also string and it will write line if

- [02:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=9887) also string and it will write line if they are equal

- [02:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=9888) they are equal or not by the way

- [02:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=9891) or not by the way even though this is not

- [02:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=9895) even though this is not inside

- [02:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=9908) because we have defined t if we remove this

- [02:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=9914) it will tell us an error you see because it doesn't support just generic

- [02:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=9919) because it doesn't support just generic however when we restrict it to a class

- [02:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=9921) however when we restrict it to a class then we can use

- [02:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=9923) then we can use boolean operator because it supports

- [02:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=9925) boolean operator because it supports class

- [02:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=9927) class and now when we run the application

- [02:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=9931) and now when we run the application since they are both string we can see

- [02:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=9934) since they are both string we can see the

- [02:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=9935) the result as here

- [02:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=9943) all right and another thing so constraining multiple values like this

- [02:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=9947) constraining multiple values like this and then some other operators like

- [02:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=9965) delegate constrains a new constraint like this

- [02:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=9968) like this okay i think this is enough for uh

- [02:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=9970) okay i think this is enough for uh generics

- [02:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=9971) generics dynamics anonymous types

- [02:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=9984) okay okay not much left all right let's see params keyboard uh

- [02:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=9987) all right let's see params keyboard uh for infinite uh parameters

- [02:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=9991) infinite uh parameters okay so i'm going to put this into

- [02:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=9994) okay so i'm going to put this into a new

- [02:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10015) all right and then let's see parameters so

- [02:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10018) let's see parameters so okay private static voids

- [02:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10028) parameterize it method and here it will take params laminators

- [02:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10033) and here it will take params laminators like this

- [02:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10041) and this will be avoid and

- [02:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10041) and [Music]

- [02:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10056) and arrow smart missing will dimension early

- [02:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10093) okay i think this is a better example object list so you see

- [02:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10096) object list so you see params keyboard is being used with a

- [02:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10099) params keyboard is being used with a single dimensional array

- [02:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10101) single dimensional array like this and it's this can be anything

- [02:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10103) like this and it's this can be anything it can be string

- [02:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10104) it can be string object or whatever we want so what's

- [02:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10109) object or whatever we want so what's goodness this would

- [02:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10115) bring us what benefits for example let's assume that

- [02:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10117) assume that this method field

- [02:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10124) sum all of the objects and then print them to the screen

- [02:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10125) them to the screen like this okay string

- [02:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10128) like this okay string wielders i will do string builders

- [02:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10137) i actually don't need that let's do this like that

- [02:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10152) sun okay when a equal to no then we will make

- [02:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10155) equal to no then we will make sum plus equal to

- [02:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10159) sum plus equal to uh item inside

- [02:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10167) list item

- [02:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10177) like this and i wonder if this is okay so this is not

- [02:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10181) is okay so this is not accepted

- [02:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10187) okay let's assume that we will uh in inherently

- [02:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10192) in inherently implicitly convert them to the

- [02:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10196) implicitly convert them to the double so double cannot be known

- [02:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10198) double so double cannot be known therefore double dots

- [02:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10200) therefore double dots let's say make it 0 and

- [02:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10203) let's say make it 0 and then we will convert this object into

- [02:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10209) then we will convert this object into cast into level like this

- [02:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10212) cast into level like this and then we will write the results

- [02:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10220) sum so all of these will work let me show you

- [02:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10224) all of these will work let me show you like one or let's say

- [02:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10227) like one or let's say one zero three

- [02:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10231) one zero three and let's say 33

- [02:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10235) and let's say 33 and like this or something like this

- [02:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10242) and like this or something like this by the way these have to be convertible

- [02:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10244) by the way these have to be convertible to double otherwise it would

- [02:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10247) to double otherwise it would cause an error so therefore we can make

- [02:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10249) cause an error so therefore we can make this as

- [02:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10251) this as double and now

- [02:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10259) i think it should work because with s keyword it will return

- [02:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10263) s keyword it will return null and we say double is non-nullable

- [02:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10267) null and we say double is non-nullable type therefore it is not working so

- [02:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10270) type therefore it is not working so maybe we can make it like this

- [02:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10279) okay like this will double no it didn't work okay so let's make it

- [02:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10282) no it didn't work okay so let's make it like this

- [02:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10290) okay and it can be long integers float whatever we want like

- [02:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10293) integers float whatever we want like like this will be float and this will be

- [02:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10297) like this will be float and this will be long

- [02:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10298) long and whatever we want

- [02:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10302) and whatever we want so the loan cannot be

- [02:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10305) so the loan cannot be it probably okay

- [02:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10314) oh long cannot feel like this here this can be flawed actually

- [02:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10316) can be flawed actually and so this is what is loss of load

- [02:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10320) and so this is what is loss of load and this can be long and we can add

- [02:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10323) and this can be long and we can add any number of elements here

- [02:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10327) any number of elements here okay so this is what does params do

- [02:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10331) okay so this is what does params do okay and all of them will work let me

- [02:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10333) okay and all of them will work let me show you

- [02:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10334) show you oh we didn't we didn't out return to the

- [02:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10337) oh we didn't we didn't out return to the screen yet

- [02:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10339) screen yet so let's also code that

- [02:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10347) okay so it says unable to cast object typho system into okay so we need to

- [02:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10350) typho system into okay so we need to have explicit casting

- [02:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10351) have explicit casting therefore let's make it like this

- [02:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10362) temp and double try parse and

- [02:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10366) double try parse and your item and then out

- [02:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10369) your item and then out maybe attempt like this

- [02:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10378) and it is asking it cannot convert object so this will be

- [02:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10381) it cannot convert object so this will be string object.sync supports because

- [02:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10386) string object.sync supports because string is nullable type

- [02:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10390) string is nullable type then which we will just sum it like this

- [02:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10393) then which we will just sum it like this and we will the right line

- [02:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10400) some string bit and five for example let's run it

- [02:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10408) okay you see they are printed on the screen

- [02:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10409) screen uh like this so this is what does

- [02:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10412) uh like this so this is what does parameterize it

- [02:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10413) parameterize it uh do okay there is also another example

- [02:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10417) uh do okay there is also another example here let's do that example

- [02:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10427) okay there is static void take value and then there are incoming values

- [02:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10432) and then there are incoming values values like this and

- [02:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10436) values like this and then we have value here it is object

- [02:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10440) then we have value here it is object type

- [02:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10441) type and we can get type and name

- [02:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10444) and we can get type and name you see we are using console.writeline

- [02:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10447) you see we are using console.writeline and since it supports new

- [02:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10449) and since it supports new nodable objects therefore all of them

- [02:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10451) nodable objects therefore all of them will work

- [02:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10452) will work and let's use it like this so you see i

- [02:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10455) and let's use it like this so you see i can send each kind of um

- [02:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10461) send each kind of um different kinds of elements so the same

- [02:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10463) different kinds of elements so the same method with

- [02:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10465) method with different number of inputs like this so

- [02:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10468) different number of inputs like this so it will handle

- [02:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10469) it will handle uh citrine it will handle a double it

- [02:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10472) uh citrine it will handle a double it will handle float

- [02:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10474) will handle float okay like this and it will handle

- [02:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10478) okay like this and it will handle a deckable like this

- [02:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10485) and all of them will be printed on the screen let's see oh

- [02:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10488) screen let's see oh moments so that's

- [02:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10491) moments so that's value okay

- [02:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10496) value okay okay so you see value attend type is

- [02:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10499) okay so you see value attend type is okay it's visual type

- [02:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10507) all right okay so the value is for example tan type is in integer but

- [02:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10510) for example tan type is in integer but yeah it's 30 type of single and that is type

- [02:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10514) it's 30 type of single and that is type single double string

- [02:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10517) single double string decrement as you can see

- [02:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10521) decrement as you can see so all of them is handled in with a

- [02:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10523) so all of them is handled in with a parameter

- [02:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10524) parameter parameter params type object

- [02:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10528) parameter params type object and these have to be single dimensional

- [02:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10531) and these have to be single dimensional and i think it doesn't support

- [02:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10533) and i think it doesn't support multi-dimensional yeah

- [02:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10558) uh input variables to a method with

- [02:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10561) a method with parents object type

- [02:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10573) how to invoke a method with any number of input variables

- [02:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10591) class coupling metric exception handling we will show

- [02:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10592) we will show it later then we have delegates evans

- [02:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10594) it later then we have delegates evans and this okay

- [02:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10596) and this okay let's start with events i think we we

- [02:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10598) let's start with events i think we we already

- [02:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10599) already seen the previously but let's see it

- [02:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10602) seen the previously but let's see it again

- [02:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10610) okay so in uh for example in a vpf application we are back we were binding

- [02:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10612) application we are back we were binding events to the

- [02:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10614) events to the such as buttons or list box or

- [02:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10617) such as buttons or list box or other things this is same actually

- [02:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10620) other things this is same actually so for example uh we are going to

- [02:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10624) so for example uh we are going to compose

- [02:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10626) compose uh events like this

- [02:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10630) uh events like this event class so let's put this inside

- [02:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10634) event class so let's put this inside part five

- [02:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10644) like this part six actually not five and then we are going to

- [02:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10648) not five and then we are going to define a class and event

- [02:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10652) define a class and event okay so what did we define we have

- [02:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10653) okay so what did we define we have defined a delegates like

- [02:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10656) defined a delegates like public delegate citrine it takes a

- [02:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10659) public delegate citrine it takes a citrine

- [02:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10660) citrine then we have defined a class event

- [02:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10662) then we have defined a class event program it has event type

- [02:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10664) program it has event type mydle event and then it has event

- [02:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10667) mydle event and then it has event program

- [02:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10669) program constructors the constructor of this

- [02:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10670) constructors the constructor of this class it assigns my event with

- [02:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10675) class it assigns my event with event let's say

- [02:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10678) event let's say overloading methods plus equal to

- [02:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10682) overloading methods plus equal to nevmydell and it will take

- [02:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10685) nevmydell and it will take this welcome user and welcome user is a

- [02:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10687) this welcome user and welcome user is a string like this

- [02:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10688) string like this it will return welcome plus username and

- [02:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10692) it will return welcome plus username and then

- [02:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10693) then we will call

- [02:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10705) so i can't access my events why

- [02:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10710) my events why because this is not public this has to

- [02:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10711) because this is not public this has to be public to be accessible

- [02:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10715) be public to be accessible all right and

- [02:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10727) okay where is the product they were programming

- [02:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10736) oh interesting i also didn't like this example it's not very much

- [02:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10741) example it's not very much explaining maybe this example is better

- [02:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10744) explaining maybe this example is better yeah

- [02:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10745) yeah so let's remove this example

- [02:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10752) and let's see so there is public delegate void notify

- [02:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10754) delegate void notify this is more sense making and we have

- [02:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10756) this is more sense making and we have public class business

- [02:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10757) public class business logic so we have public events notified

- [02:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10761) logic so we have public events notified here

- [02:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10762) here so this is events this is delegates we

- [02:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10764) so this is events this is delegates we have

- [02:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10765) have public voice start process it says

- [02:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10768) public voice start process it says process started and

- [02:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10769) process started and on process completed okay there is

- [02:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10772) on process completed okay there is another

- [02:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10773) another method called here and it's a mutual

- [02:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10776) method called here and it's a mutual void

- [02:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10777) void and it will invoke process completed

- [02:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10780) and it will invoke process completed that in

- [02:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10780) that in work okay so

- [02:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10789) let's actually start reading because we won't understand without reading

- [02:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10795) c sharp events an event is a notification sent by an object to

- [02:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10798) is a notification sent by an object to signal the occurrence of an action

- [03:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10800) signal the occurrence of an action okay this is really important so what is

- [03:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10801) okay this is really important so what is event an event is a notification

- [03:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10804) event an event is a notification sent by an object to signal oculus of an

- [03:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10806) sent by an object to signal oculus of an action

- [03:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10807) action such as when you receive an email you

- [03:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10811) such as when you receive an email you get a

- [03:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10811) get a push notification right so it is

- [03:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10814) push notification right so it is triggering event of push

- [03:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10816) triggering event of push uh notification when an email arrives

- [03:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10819) uh notification when an email arrives your inbox

- [03:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10820) your inbox okay so this is like that

- [03:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10825) okay so this is like that eventsin.net follow the observer design

- [03:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10828) eventsin.net follow the observer design pattern

- [03:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10829) pattern the class who raises events is called

- [03:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10831) the class who raises events is called publisher and the class who receives the

- [03:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10833) publisher and the class who receives the notification is called subscriber

- [03:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10836) notification is called subscriber there can be multiple subscribers of a

- [03:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10838) there can be multiple subscribers of a single event

- [03:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10840) single event typically a publisher raises an event

- [03:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10842) typically a publisher raises an event when some action occurred

- [03:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10844) when some action occurred the subscribers who are interested in

- [03:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10846) the subscribers who are interested in getting a notification when an action

- [03:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10848) getting a notification when an action occurred should register with an event and handle

- [03:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10850) should register with an event and handle it

- [03:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10852) it in c sharp an event is an encapsulated

- [03:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10854) in c sharp an event is an encapsulated delegate

- [03:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10855) delegate it is dependent on the delegate the

- [03:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10858) it is dependent on the delegate the delegate defines the signature for the

- [03:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10860) delegate defines the signature for the event handler method of the subscriber

- [03:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10862) event handler method of the subscriber class

- [03:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10862) class so the delegate defines signatures for

- [03:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10865) so the delegate defines signatures for the event handler method

- [03:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10866) the event handler method so here basically we are defining the

- [03:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10870) so here basically we are defining the signature and the signature

- [03:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10871) signature and the signature is empty as you see there is nothing it

- [03:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10874) is empty as you see there is nothing it takes okay

- [03:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10876) takes okay and also it is void therefore it doesn't

- [03:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10880) and also it is void therefore it doesn't return anything as well

- [03:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10882) return anything as well so this is the signatures so there is an

- [03:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10884) so this is the signatures so there is an illustration

- [03:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10885) illustration and let's see the illustration

- [03:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10888) and let's see the illustration in bigger size so we have subscriber

- [03:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10891) in bigger size so we have subscriber subscribe

- [03:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10892) subscribe event plus equal to event handler

- [03:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10895) event plus equal to event handler subscriber events and then there is the

- [03:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10897) subscriber events and then there is the publisher

- [03:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10898) publisher it has delegates so event handler is

- [03:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10900) it has delegates so event handler is bound to the delegate of the publisher

- [03:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10903) bound to the delegate of the publisher and the publisher when an event occurs

- [03:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10905) and the publisher when an event occurs it

- [03:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10907) it notifies the subscriber and then

- [03:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10909) notifies the subscriber and then subscriber can do anything

- [03:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10910) subscriber can do anything when that event happens so usually

- [03:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10913) when that event happens so usually another subscriber

- [03:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10914) another subscriber can subscribe to the publisher as well

- [03:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10927) declare an event an event can be declared in two steps

- [03:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10930) declared in two steps declare a delegate declare a variable of

- [03:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10933) declare a delegate declare a variable of the delegate with event keyword

- [03:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10936) the delegate with event keyword the following example shows how to

- [03:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10937) the following example shows how to declare an event in publisher class

- [03:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10940) declare an event in publisher class so you see we are declaring a delegate

- [03:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10942) so you see we are declaring a delegate here and from the same name so this is

- [03:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10944) here and from the same name so this is meaning that

- [03:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10945) meaning that it is bound to this delegate we define

- [03:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10947) it is bound to this delegate we define an event like this

- [03:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10949) an event like this so this is our delegate you see it shows

- [03:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10951) so this is our delegate you see it shows delegate and you see this is

- [03:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10952) delegate and you see this is bound to that delegate actually here

- [03:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10956) bound to that delegate actually here and this is the event itself

- [03:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10963) in the above example we declared a delegate notify

- [03:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10965) delegate notify and then declared an event process

- [03:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10966) and then declared an event process completed of delegate type notify using

- [03:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10969) completed of delegate type notify using event keyword in the process business

- [03:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10971) event keyword in the process business logic class

- [03:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10972) logic class thus the process business logic class is

- [03:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10975) thus the process business logic class is called the publisher

- [03:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10977) called the publisher so it will call the publisher and we

- [03:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10979) so it will call the publisher and we didn't quote the publisher yet

- [03:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10982) didn't quote the publisher yet the notify delegate specifies the

- [03:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10984) the notify delegate specifies the signature for the process completed

- [03:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10986) signature for the process completed event handler

- [03:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10988) event handler it specifies that the event handler

- [03:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10990) it specifies that the event handler method in subscriber class must have a

- [03:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10992) method in subscriber class must have a void return type and no parameters

- [03:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10994) void return type and no parameters yes it is the basic signature thing i

- [03:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10996) yes it is the basic signature thing i will also show you another

- [03:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=10998) will also show you another signature having event now let's see how

- [03:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=11001) signature having event now let's see how to raise the process completed event

- [03:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=11004) to raise the process completed event consider the following implementation

- [03:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=11007) consider the following implementation okay so this is our implementation

- [03:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=11009) okay so this is our implementation and here uh you see with invoke method

- [03:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=11013) and here uh you see with invoke method actually it is invoking the nodify

- [03:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=11016) actually it is invoking the nodify event here so

- [03:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=11021) event here so how it is bound it is bond with process

- [03:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=11024) how it is bound it is bond with process completed

- [03:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=11025) completed notification and this is it you see

- [03:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=11028) notification and this is it you see so this is void business logic on

- [03:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=11030) so this is void business logic on process completed

- [03:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=11033) process completed and here it is invoking these events

- [03:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=11035) and here it is invoking these events basically so this is

- [03:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=11037) basically so this is an event you see event and events are

- [03:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=11039) an event you see event and events are colored with inbox and you see it is

- [03:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=11042) colored with inbox and you see it is also checking and no check

- [03:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=11043) also checking and no check with here

- [03:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=11050) okay let's continue reading above the start process method calls the

- [03:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=11052) above the start process method calls the method on process completed

- [03:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=11054) method on process completed at the end which raises an event

- [03:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=11057) at the end which raises an event typically

- [03:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=11057) typically to raise an event protected in virtual

- [03:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=11060) to raise an event protected in virtual methods should be defined with the name

- [03:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=11061) methods should be defined with the name on event name

- [03:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=11063) on event name protected in virtual enable derived

- [03:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=11065) protected in virtual enable derived classes to override the logic for

- [03:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=11067) classes to override the logic for raising the event

- [03:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=11069) raising the event however a derived class should always

- [03:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=11071) however a derived class should always call the on event name method of the

- [03:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=11072) call the on event name method of the base class to ensure that registered

- [03:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=11074) base class to ensure that registered delegates receive the event

- [03:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=11077) delegates receive the event the on process completed method invokes

- [03:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=11079) the on process completed method invokes the delegate using process completed

- [03:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=11082) the delegate using process completed invoke this will call all the event

- [03:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=11085) invoke this will call all the event handler methods registered with the

- [03:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=11087) handler methods registered with the process completed event the subscriber

- [03:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=11090) process completed event the subscriber class must register to process completed

- [03:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=11092) class must register to process completed event and handle it with the method

- [03:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=11094) event and handle it with the method whose signature matches notify delegate

- [03:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=11096) whose signature matches notify delegate as shown below

- [03:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=11098) as shown below and then there is the example

- [03:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=11103) and then there is the example so here we define a business logic

- [03:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=11105) so here we define a business logic instance

- [03:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=11106) instance like here then we assign an event to the

- [03:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=11109) like here then we assign an event to the business process completed

- [03:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=11112) business process completed and it is not as coded yet so let's go

- [03:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=11115) and it is not as coded yet so let's go to event handlers

- [03:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=11117) to event handlers like this so we have assigned process

- [03:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=11119) like this so we have assigned process completed to this method

- [03:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=11121) completed to this method so when this process completed event is

- [03:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=11125) so when this process completed event is uh notified not the publisher notifies

- [03:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=11129) uh notified not the publisher notifies this will be

- [03:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=11135) executed and then we can call start process and the

- [03:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=11136) process and the start process will call this method at

- [03:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=11138) start process will call this method at the end of the process and that

- [03:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=11140) the end of the process and that and at the end of the process the invoke

- [03:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=11142) and at the end of the process the invoke will be

- [03:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=11144) will be called and invoke is here okay

- [03:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=11147) called and invoke is here okay so this is uh let's uh

- [03:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=11151) so this is uh let's uh tell this uh

- [03:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=11161) let's say let's explain this in more details such as

- [03:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=11165) explain this in more details such as the event or

- [03:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=11174) okay process bluetooth let's say okay the process will logic okay notified

- [03:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=11178) the process will logic okay notified the subscribers

- [03:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=11186) process completed so this is this will be called when the process buzzer

- [03:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=11188) be called when the process buzzer bullishness logic

- [03:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=11189) bullishness logic notifies the subscribers okay

- [03:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=11192) notifies the subscribers okay so let's add a date time

- [03:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=11208) and then i will have multiple subscribers okay so how am i gonna do

- [03:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=11211) subscribers okay so how am i gonna do that

- [03:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=11225) okay so here we are calling the start process and here i will make

- [03:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=11229) start process and here i will make something random

- [03:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=11230) something random but

- [03:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=11239) and here uh system reading thread sleep needs okay

- [03:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=11243) sleep needs okay my round starts next so this will be

- [03:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=11246) my round starts next so this will be based on milliseconds so

- [03:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=11250) based on milliseconds so between 1 millisecond and 110

- [03:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=11253) between 1 millisecond and 110 milliseconds

- [03:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=11255) milliseconds and then i will start multiple processes

- [03:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=11258) and then i will start multiple processes and

- [03:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=11263) bind them so let's start under tasks

- [03:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=11267) let's start under tasks task.factory okay i also need to add

- [03:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=11271) task.factory okay i also need to add using system

- [03:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=11272) using system trading tasks start new

- [03:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=11283) okay it will be like this i will take this into that

- [03:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=11286) i will take this into that okay we can also

- [03:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=11290) okay we can also provide a let's say

- [03:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=11293) provide a let's say id like with ir id

- [03:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=11298) id like with ir id so let's add id to here

- [03:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=11307) and then okay let's also change our notification as

- [03:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=11308) notification as in our id okay so now i have to change

- [03:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=11313) in our id okay so now i have to change my invoke method so on completed so

- [03:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=11317) my invoke method so on completed so invoke will require i

- [03:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=11318) invoke will require i id and i will

- [03:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=11322) id and i will provide its id because we have changed

- [03:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=11326) provide its id because we have changed the signature of the

- [03:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=11329) the signature of the event okay

- [03:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=11334) event okay and when it is invoked it will also get

- [03:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=11338) and when it is invoked it will also get an overload okay so

- [03:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=11361) so plus equal to top top and it requires a parameter coming from

- [03:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=11370) and it requires a parameter coming from yeah it is requiring an id you see it

- [03:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=11373) yeah it is requiring an id you see it has automatically generated

- [03:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=11375) has automatically generated so where do we where will we get this id

- [03:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=11377) so where do we where will we get this id if you ask

- [03:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=11383) in the process business logic we are going to

- [03:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=11384) going to provide a

- [03:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=11386) provide a [Music]

- [03:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=11388) [Music] start process with a id

- [03:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=11391) start process with a id and therefore it will take i and

- [03:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=11400) for this i think

- [03:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=11401) i think [Music]

- [03:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=11410) okay we need to get this id from invoke methods

- [03:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=11417) let me find an example c sharp invoke with parameters

- [03:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=11431) so we can invoke with class instance and parameters array

- [03:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=11440) parameters array okay c sharp how

- [03:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=11443) okay c sharp how void events with parameters i think this

- [03:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=11446) void events with parameters i think this is the keyword that we need to look for

- [03:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=11468) so when subscribing events how do we

- [03:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=11510) okay we have notified the notify takes a parameter

- [03:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=11512) parameter and then we have to pass it to the

- [03:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=11545) yeah i think i can keep it inside here but this will be private

- [03:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=11548) but this will be private and if i make it private

- [03:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=11553) and if i make it private maybe i can

- [03:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=11556) maybe i can you know i know i have to make it public

- [03:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=11558) you know i know i have to make it public i think

- [03:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=11566) okay i are id so i will set this ir id to

- [03:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=11578) okay so this dot ir id equal to ir id let's

- [03:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=11581) equal to ir id let's let's name this as id of event

- [03:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=11586) let's name this as id of event okay like this and on process completed

- [03:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=11594) okay like this and on process completed so now we don't need to notify with

- [03:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=11597) so now we don't need to notify with parameters

- [03:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=11598) parameters anymore and let's remove this

- [03:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=11603) anymore and let's remove this remove this and on

- [03:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=11606) remove this and on invoke we can simply use or this will be

- [03:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=11610) invoke we can simply use or this will be still

- [03:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=11611) still taking ir id yeah

- [03:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=11614) taking ir id yeah so it has to be like that we have to

- [03:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=11616) so it has to be like that we have to make it

- [03:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=11617) make it and i will just you provide

- [03:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=11620) and i will just you provide pl dot id of event

- [03:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=11624) pl dot id of event and then start with this okay so there

- [03:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=11628) and then start with this okay so there is the error

- [03:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=11631) is the error so the notify is worried for it okay

- [03:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=11652) okay where is the difference i don't see any difference here

- [03:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=11654) any difference here it is exactly same

- [03:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=11685) okay so on process completed we don't need this

- [03:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=11686) need this or we need this yeah like this

- [03:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=11693) or we need this yeah like this and we have assigned

- [03:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=11696) and we have assigned it but we didn't provide id

- [03:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=11713) this and let's see what happens okay we have another problem

- [03:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=11729) cannot impose the convert type way to lecture program will be fine

- [03:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=11737) i think it is because of what my experience so this is void

- [03:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=11740) what my experience so this is void notify

- [03:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=11743) notify this is also void

- [03:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=11794) it says it matches the signature but currently we are having a problem and

- [03:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=11797) currently we are having a problem and maybe it is because

- [03:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=11799) maybe it is because this is static maybe this has to be

- [03:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=11802) this is static maybe this has to be non-static

- [03:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=11814) public event notify process completed process completed oh

- [03:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=11818) process completed oh i think this has to be right

- [03:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=11881) public static voice okay this is working but our parameter

- [03:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=11884) this is working but our parameter passing is not working

- [03:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=11888) passing is not working okay and we didn't get anything because

- [03:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=11890) okay and we didn't get anything because we didn't implement anything yet

- [03:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=11903) and let's put a breakpoint here to see what happens

- [03:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=11913) oh we are not waiting tasks to be completed so

- [03:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=11916) completed so let's add a let's make a list of tasks

- [03:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=11926) or we can make it parallel force yeah parallel is better option here

- [03:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=11946) so from inclusive uh 1 to 100 and then we will define a new

- [03:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=11950) 100 and then we will define a new action like this

- [03:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=11959) okay so the new action will be like

- [03:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=11971) for the body will be probably something like this

- [03:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=11986) let me check an example you have used it but i don't remember

- [03:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=11989) you have used it but i don't remember from memory

- [03:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12011) okay just just like this here and here

- [03:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12014) and here we will put it so each one of them will

- [03:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12017) we will put it so each one of them will be a task

- [03:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12017) be a task and it will wait for all tasks to be

- [03:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12020) and it will wait for all tasks to be completed to continue

- [03:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12023) completed to continue and we will just provide index okay now

- [03:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12025) and we will just provide index okay now i get the

- [03:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12027) i get the logic so these parameters

- [03:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12031) logic so these parameters will be coming from here therefore we

- [03:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12034) will be coming from here therefore we don't provide it

- [03:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12036) don't provide it here okay we don't provide

- [03:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12039) here okay we don't provide any parameters here because

- [03:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12044) any parameters here because they are coming from

- [03:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12056) now let's send the application okay hundreds process started you see

- [03:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12059) okay hundreds process started you see they are coming with different times

- [03:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12062) they are coming with different times it's starting under process

- [03:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12076) and then we are starting to get subscriber notification

- [03:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12085) like this okay it is working so let's make the

- [03:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12089) so let's make the message more sense making okay process

- [03:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12098) id equal to

- [03:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12111) and top character like this and here

- [03:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12139) okay so in parallel for uc they are not executing with the order that you would

- [03:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12142) executing with the order that you would expect

- [03:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12143) expect one start and then these start actually

- [03:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12146) one start and then these start actually they are all executed immediately then

- [03:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12148) they are all executed immediately then they are started

- [03:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12149) they are started according to the uh

- [03:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12154) according to the uh dotnet tasks therefore you see they are

- [03:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12157) dotnet tasks therefore you see they are not within

- [03:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12158) not within with the order that we provided

- [03:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12161) with the order that we provided they are started by the.net task system

- [03:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12166) they are started by the.net task system and for example this is completed at

- [03:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12169) and for example this is completed at least is completed here

- [03:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12172) least is completed here process id for 49 then we will start

- [03:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12176) process id for 49 then we will start seeing other processes getting completed and

- [03:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12179) other processes getting completed and other processes are getting started

- [03:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12186) we can also see how many processes are running in our

- [03:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12188) running in our application such as

- [03:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12192) application such as let's check it out from

- [03:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12201) i think it's name will be lecture 13 cm [Music]

- [03:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12216) yes and we can see it from here let's open the resources monitor

- [03:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12220) open the resources monitor and on cpu

- [03:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12223) and on cpu we can see okay so it has one or not 100

- [03:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12226) we can see okay so it has one or not 100 threads

- [03:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12227) threads as you see and because we are starting

- [03:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12231) as you see and because we are starting processes

- [03:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12237) when we start the process it should immediately type to the screen

- [03:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12240) immediately type to the screen however they are not or maybe we need to

- [03:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12243) however they are not or maybe we need to hit oh yeah we have to hit the key

- [03:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12246) hit oh yeah we have to hit the key and yeah we can see so when i hit a key

- [03:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12249) and yeah we can see so when i hit a key it just starts

- [03:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12251) it just starts it just stops printing so all processes

- [03:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12254) it just stops printing so all processes started

- [03:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12256) started and they are getting notified as they

- [03:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12258) and they are getting notified as they getting completed

- [03:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12260) getting completed this is how you can make event

- [03:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12263) this is how you can make event binding it is extremely useful when you

- [03:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12266) binding it is extremely useful when you are waiting

- [03:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12267) are waiting something to be completed and

- [03:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12270) something to be completed and this is it this is how you define event

- [03:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12272) this is it this is how you define event delegate

- [03:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12273) delegate and notify subscribers how to

- [03:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12280) and notify subscribers how to define delegates and events

- [03:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12285) define delegates and events to notify subscribers

- [03:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12289) to notify subscribers when an event

- [03:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12316) yeah okay so we have seen these two and only our

- [03:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12320) so we have seen these two and only our synchronous await keywords trading

- [03:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12323) synchronous await keywords trading let's check this too

- [03:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12336) so the class coupling is nested classes i think if i remember

- [03:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12338) i think if i remember correctly

- [03:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12350) okay this is not a very important thing

- [03:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12351) this is not a very important thing actually code class matrix class

- [03:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12353) actually code class matrix class coupling but

- [03:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12354) coupling but let's just read it

- [03:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12371) code metrics class coupling january 8 2021

- [03:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12374) january 8 2021 for minutes to read class coupling also

- [03:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12378) for minutes to read class coupling also goes by the name coupling between

- [03:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12379) goes by the name coupling between objects

- [03:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12380) objects cbo as originally defined by ck 94.

- [03:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12384) cbo as originally defined by ck 94. basically class coupling is a measure of

- [03:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12387) basically class coupling is a measure of how many classes a single class uses

- [03:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12390) how many classes a single class uses a high number is bad and a low number is

- [03:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12392) a high number is bad and a low number is usually good with this metric

- [03:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12394) usually good with this metric class coupling has been shown to be an

- [03:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12396) class coupling has been shown to be an accurate predictor of software failure

- [03:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12398) accurate predictor of software failure in recent studies have shown that an

- [03:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12400) in recent studies have shown that an upper limit value of nine

- [03:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12401) upper limit value of nine is the most efficient s 2010 so

- [03:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12405) is the most efficient s 2010 so what is class coupling it is a number of

- [03:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12407) what is class coupling it is a number of other classes

- [03:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12409) other classes class users and you should not

- [03:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12413) class users and you should not exist nine according to the microsoft

- [03:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12417) exist nine according to the microsoft documentation

- [03:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12418) documentation class coupling measures the coupling to

- [03:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12420) class coupling measures the coupling to unique classes through parameters

- [03:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12430) interface implementations fields defined on external types

- [03:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12432) on external types and attribute decoration good software

- [03:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12435) and attribute decoration good software design dictates the types and methods

- [03:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12437) design dictates the types and methods should have high cohesion

- [03:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12438) should have high cohesion and low coupling high coupling indicates

- [03:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12441) and low coupling high coupling indicates a design that is difficult to reuse and

- [03:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12443) a design that is difficult to reuse and maintain

- [03:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12444) maintain because of its many interdependencies on

- [03:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12446) because of its many interdependencies on other types

- [03:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12448) other types the concepts of coupling and cohesion

- [03:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12450) the concepts of coupling and cohesion are clearly related

- [03:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12452) are clearly related to keep this discussion on topic we will

- [03:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12454) to keep this discussion on topic we will not get into depth with cohesion other

- [03:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12456) not get into depth with cohesion other than to give a brief definition from

- [03:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12458) than to give a brief definition from kkls 2000

- [03:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12461) kkls 2000 module cohesion was introduced by jordan

- [03:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12463) module cohesion was introduced by jordan and constantine

- [03:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12464) and constantine as how tightly bound or related the

- [03:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12466) as how tightly bound or related the internal elements of a module

- [03:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12468) internal elements of a module are to one another yc79 a module has a

- [03:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12471) are to one another yc79 a module has a strong cohesion if it represents exactly

- [03:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12474) strong cohesion if it represents exactly one task

- [03:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12475) one task and all its elements contribute to this

- [03:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12477) and all its elements contribute to this single task

- [03:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12478) single task they describe cohesion as an attribute

- [03:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12480) they describe cohesion as an attribute of design rather than code

- [03:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12482) of design rather than code and an attribute that can be used to

- [03:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12484) and an attribute that can be used to predict reusability

- [03:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12485) predict reusability maintainability and change your ability

- [03:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12489) maintainability and change your ability class coupling example let's look at

- [03:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12492) class coupling example let's look at class coupling in action

- [03:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12494) class coupling in action first create a new console application

- [03:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12497) first create a new console application and create a new class called person

- [03:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12499) and create a new class called person with some properties in it then

- [03:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12500) with some properties in it then immediately calculate the code metrics

- [03:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12502) immediately calculate the code metrics okay let's calculate code metrics of of

- [03:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12505) okay let's calculate code metrics of of our classes so when i right click

- [03:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12518) metrics okay maybe from here how do we calculate

- [03:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12521) okay maybe from here how do we calculate the quote matrix

- [03:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12530) maybe analyze calculate code matrix yeah for solution

- [03:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12538) okay then it shows our classes so first let's see our process business

- [03:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12541) so first let's see our process business logic class

- [03:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12543) logic class which is here and

- [03:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12547) which is here and called source do i see the code mastery

- [03:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12551) called source do i see the code mastery somewhere here right now

- [03:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12560) somewhere here right now no

- [03:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12575) okay why i don't see the quote matrix of class so

- [03:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12600) but how this screened it appears where i can see it

- [03:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12617) no window yeah there's code metric results

- [03:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12621) window yeah there's code metric results no this is not what we want

- [03:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12625) no this is not what we want okay and it shows class coupling one

- [03:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12628) okay and it shows class coupling one we can see it from here but i couldn't

- [03:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12631) we can see it from here but i couldn't find it

- [03:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12632) find it uh from displaying here so

- [03:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12636) uh from displaying here so this has one and if i add

- [03:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12640) this has one and if i add another class inside it such as let's

- [03:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12643) another class inside it such as let's add

- [03:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12649) or another class okay like datastore2 and let's see what

- [03:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12653) okay like datastore2 and let's see what will become its

- [03:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12655) will become its code metrics

- [03:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12659) code metrics okay process business logic i'm going to

- [03:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12661) okay process business logic i'm going to add a

- [03:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12662) add a property as prop let's start with this

- [03:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12667) property as prop let's start with this and

- [03:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12668) and [Music]

- [03:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12671) [Music] so it requires a type as let's say

- [03:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12674) so it requires a type as let's say string

- [03:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12697) oh so this is a limited class probably so let's use another class let's use

- [03:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12700) so let's use another class let's use students

- [03:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12708) okay and let's recalculate the code metrics okay analyze

- [03:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12710) metrics okay analyze [Music]

- [03:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12712) [Music] and

- [03:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12714) and okay called metric results and we need

- [03:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12717) okay called metric results and we need to refresh or something

- [03:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12733) and now let's check the business logic and the class coupling is now

- [03:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12734) and the class coupling is now five you see it has increased it to five

- [03:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12745) why because in the student class i don't know it is increases from one to

- [03:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12747) i don't know it is increases from one to five

- [03:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12748) five so let's read continue reading from the

- [03:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12751) so let's read continue reading from the page let's look at class coupling in

- [03:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12755) page let's look at class coupling in action

- [03:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12756) action first create a new console application

- [03:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12759) first create a new console application and create a new class called

- [03:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12760) and create a new class called person with some properties in it then

- [03:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12762) person with some properties in it then immediately calculate the code metrics

- [03:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12765) immediately calculate the code metrics notice the class coupling is zero since

- [03:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12768) notice the class coupling is zero since this class doesn't use any other classes

- [03:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12771) this class doesn't use any other classes now create another class called person

- [03:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12773) now create another class called person stuff with a method that creates an

- [03:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12774) stuff with a method that creates an instance of person

- [03:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12775) instance of person and sets the property values calculate

- [03:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12778) and sets the property values calculate the code metrics again

- [03:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12781) the code metrics again see how the class coupling value goes up

- [03:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12784) see how the class coupling value goes up also notice that no matter how many

- [03:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12786) also notice that no matter how many properties you set

- [03:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12787) properties you set the class coupling value just goes up by

- [03:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12789) the class coupling value just goes up by one and not by some other value

- [03:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12792) one and not by some other value class coupling measures each class only

- [03:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12794) class coupling measures each class only once for this metric no matter how much

- [03:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12796) once for this metric no matter how much it is used

- [03:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12798) it is used in addition can you see that do

- [03:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12799) in addition can you see that do something has a one but the constructor

- [03:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12801) something has a one but the constructor person stuff

- [03:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12802) person stuff has a zero for its value currently there

- [03:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12805) has a zero for its value currently there is no code in the constructor that is

- [03:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12807) is no code in the constructor that is using another class

- [03:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12809) using another class what if you put code in the constructor

- [03:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12811) what if you put code in the constructor that used another class

- [03:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12813) that used another class here is what you get now the constructor

- [03:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12817) here is what you get now the constructor clearly has code that uses another class

- [03:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12819) clearly has code that uses another class and the class coupling metric shows this

- [03:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12821) and the class coupling metric shows this fact

- [03:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12822) fact again you can see the overall class

- [03:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12825) again you can see the overall class coupling for person

- [03:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12825) coupling for person stuff is one and do something is also

- [03:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12828) stuff is one and do something is also one to show that only one external class

- [03:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12830) one to show that only one external class is being used no matter how much

- [03:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12832) is being used no matter how much internal code you have that uses it

- [03:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12835) internal code you have that uses it next create another new class give this

- [03:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12838) next create another new class give this class some name

- [03:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12839) class some name and create some properties inside it

- [03:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12842) and create some properties inside it now consume the class in our do

- [03:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12844) now consume the class in our do something method within the person stuff

- [03:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12845) something method within the person stuff class and calculate code metrics again

- [03:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12849) class and calculate code metrics again so as we add more classes it increases

- [03:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12852) so as we add more classes it increases and the magic number is

- [03:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12854) and the magic number is 9 do not

- [03:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12856) 9 do not [Music]

- [03:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12859) [Music] exit 9 this is something that you

- [03:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12863) exit 9 this is something that you you want to be average

- [03:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12867) you want to be average coupling and why to avoid

- [03:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12871) coupling and why to avoid magic away to avoid exceeding

- [03:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12883) nine all right so for the next week i will hopefully show you a synchronous

- [03:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12884) will hopefully show you a synchronous and evade keyboards and

- [03:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12886) and evade keyboards and exception handling in a crawler uh

- [03:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12889) exception handling in a crawler uh this week already we have we are over 34

- [03:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12894) this week already we have we are over 34 minutes

- [03:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12895) minutes let's upload our source code

- [03:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12932) uh you need to make a project that uses these features to understand

- [03:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12934) these features to understand perfectly otherwise just typing them

- [03:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12938) perfectly otherwise just typing them you will understand a little bit but you

- [03:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12939) you will understand a little bit but you will forget it later but once you use

- [03:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12942) will forget it later but once you use them in a real project

- [03:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12943) them in a real project uh you will understand them currently

- [03:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12947) uh you will understand them currently having an idea of these things exist and

- [03:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12950) having an idea of these things exist and that you can utilize them

- [03:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12951) that you can utilize them when you need them is sufficient because

- [03:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12955) when you need them is sufficient because if you don't know what to do then you

- [03:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12957) if you don't know what to do then you can't look for it you can't search for

- [03:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12959) can't look for it you can't search for it so having an idea of what is available

- [03:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12963) so having an idea of what is available to do

- [03:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12964) to do what is available to use uh that is the

- [03:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12967) what is available to use uh that is the important part

- [03:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12968) important part once you have an idea that for example

- [03:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12971) once you have an idea that for example uh generics are available that

- [03:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12975) uh generics are available that and then you can utilize it then you can

- [03:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12978) and then you can utilize it then you can look for generics and utilize it okay

- [03:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12981) look for generics and utilize it okay okay end of lecture 13 hopefully see you

- [03:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjCdeJyO7kU&t=12983) okay end of lecture 13 hopefully see you next week
