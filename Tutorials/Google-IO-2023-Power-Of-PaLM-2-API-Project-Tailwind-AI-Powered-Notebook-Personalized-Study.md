### Video Transcription


- [00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_KWTkYXmRw&t=3) Thanks Thomas, our work is enabling businesses&nbsp; and it's also empowering developers.&nbsp;

- [00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_KWTkYXmRw&t=9) Palm 2, our most capable language model that&nbsp; Sundar talked about, powers the Palm API.&nbsp;

- [00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_KWTkYXmRw&t=16) Since March, we've been running a private&nbsp; preview with our Palm API and it's been amazing&nbsp;

- [00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_KWTkYXmRw&t=21) to see how quickly developers have&nbsp; used it in their applications.&nbsp;

- [00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_KWTkYXmRw&t=26) Like Chapter, who are generating stories so&nbsp; you can choose your own adventure, forever&nbsp;

- [00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_KWTkYXmRw&t=32) changing story time. Or Game On Technology, a company that makes&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_KWTkYXmRw&t=37) chat apps for sports fans and retail brands to connect with their audiences.&nbsp;

- [00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_KWTkYXmRw&t=42) And there's also Wendy's, they're using the&nbsp; Palm API to help customers place that correct&nbsp;

- [00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_KWTkYXmRw&t=47) order for the junior bacon cheeseburger they&nbsp; talked about in their talk to menu feature.&nbsp;

- [00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_KWTkYXmRw&t=53) But I'm most excited about the response we've&nbsp; gotten from the developer tools community.&nbsp;

- [00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_KWTkYXmRw&t=59) Developers want choice when it comes to language&nbsp; models and we're working with leading developer&nbsp;

- [00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_KWTkYXmRw&t=64) tools companies like Langchain, Chroma&nbsp; and many more to support the Palm API.&nbsp;

- [00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_KWTkYXmRw&t=71) We've also integrated it into Google&nbsp; developer tools like Firebase and Colab.&nbsp;

- [00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_KWTkYXmRw&t=82) You can hear a lot more about the Palm API&nbsp; in the developer keynote and sign up today.&nbsp;

- [00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_KWTkYXmRw&t=89) Now to show you just how powerful the Palm&nbsp; API is, I want to share one concept that five&nbsp;

- [00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_KWTkYXmRw&t=95) engineers at Google put together&nbsp; over the last few weeks.&nbsp;

- [00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_KWTkYXmRw&t=99) The idea is called Project Tailwind&nbsp; and we think of it as an AI first&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_KWTkYXmRw&t=105) notebook that helps you learn faster.&nbsp;

- [00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_KWTkYXmRw&t=108) Like a real notebook, your notes&nbsp; and your sources power Tailwind.&nbsp;

- [00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_KWTkYXmRw&t=115) How it works is you can simply pick the files&nbsp; from Google Drive and it effectively creates&nbsp;

- [00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_KWTkYXmRw&t=121) a personalized and private AI model that&nbsp; has expertise in the information that&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_KWTkYXmRw&t=128) you give it.&nbsp;

- [00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_KWTkYXmRw&t=129) We've been developing this idea with authors like&nbsp; Steven Johnson and testing it at universities&nbsp;

- [00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_KWTkYXmRw&t=135) like Arizona State and the University&nbsp; of Oklahoma where I went to school.&nbsp;

- [00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_KWTkYXmRw&t=139) Do you want to see how it works? Let's do a live demo.&nbsp;

- [00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_KWTkYXmRw&t=145) Now imagine that I'm a student taking&nbsp; a computer science history class.&nbsp;

- [00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_KWTkYXmRw&t=149) I'll open up Tailwind and I can quickly see&nbsp; in Google Drive all my different notes and&nbsp;

- [00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_KWTkYXmRw&t=155) assignments and readings. I can insert them and what will happen when&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_KWTkYXmRw&t=160) Tailwind loads up, as you can see, my different notes and articles on the side.&nbsp;

- [00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_KWTkYXmRw&t=166) Here they are in the middle and it instantly&nbsp; creates a study guide on the right to give&nbsp;

- [00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_KWTkYXmRw&t=171) me bearings. You can see it's pulling out key concepts&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_KWTkYXmRw&t=174) and questions grounded in the materials that I've given it.&nbsp;

- [00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_KWTkYXmRw&t=179) Now I can come over here and quickly change&nbsp; it to go across all the different sources&nbsp;

- [00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_KWTkYXmRw&t=184) and type something like&nbsp; create glossary for Hopper.&nbsp;

- [00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_KWTkYXmRw&t=189) What's going to happen behind the scenes&nbsp; is it will automatically compile a glossary&nbsp;

- [00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_KWTkYXmRw&t=194) associated with all the different notes and&nbsp; articles relating to Grace Hopper, the computer&nbsp;

- [00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_KWTkYXmRw&t=200) science history pioneer. Look at this, Flowmatic, Cobol,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_KWTkYXmRw&t=203) Compiler, all created based on my notes. Now let's try one more.&nbsp;

- [00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_KWTkYXmRw&t=210) I'm going to try something else called&nbsp; different viewpoints on Dynabook.&nbsp;

- [00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_KWTkYXmRw&t=215) So the Dynabook, this was a concept from Alan Kay. Again, Tailwind going out,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_KWTkYXmRw&t=220) finding all the different things. You can see how quick it comes back.&nbsp;

- [00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_KWTkYXmRw&t=223) There it is. And what's interesting here is&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_KWTkYXmRw&t=225) it's helping me think through the concept. So it's giving me different viewpoints.&nbsp;

- [00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_KWTkYXmRw&t=229) It was a visionary product. It was a missed opportunity.&nbsp;

- [00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_KWTkYXmRw&t=232) But my favorite part is it shows its work. You can see the citations here.&nbsp;

- [00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_KWTkYXmRw&t=237) When I hover over, here's&nbsp; something from my class notes.&nbsp;

- [00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_KWTkYXmRw&t=242) Here's something from an&nbsp; article the teacher assigned.&nbsp;

- [00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_KWTkYXmRw&t=244) It's all right here, grounded in my sources.&nbsp;

- [00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_KWTkYXmRw&t=254) Now Project Tailwind is still in its early&nbsp; days, but we've had so much fun making this&nbsp;

- [00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_KWTkYXmRw&t=259) prototype, and we realized&nbsp; it's not just for students.&nbsp;

- [00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_KWTkYXmRw&t=263) It's helpful for anyone synthesizing information&nbsp; from many different sources that you choose,&nbsp;

- [00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_KWTkYXmRw&t=271) like writers researching an article, or&nbsp; analysts going through earnings calls,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_KWTkYXmRw&t=276) or even lawyers preparing for a case.&nbsp;

- [00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_KWTkYXmRw&t=279) Imagine collaborating with an AI that's grounded&nbsp; in what you've read in all of your notes.&nbsp;

- [00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_KWTkYXmRw&t=287) We want to make it available to&nbsp; try it out if you want to see it.&nbsp;

- [00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_KWTkYXmRw&t=296) There's a lot more you can do with Palm 2.&nbsp;

- [00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_KWTkYXmRw&t=299) And we can't wait to see what&nbsp; you build using the Palm API.&nbsp;

- [00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_KWTkYXmRw&t=304) Generative AI is changing what&nbsp; it means to develop new products.&nbsp;

- [00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_KWTkYXmRw&t=308) At Google, we offer the best ML infrastructure,&nbsp; with powerful models, including those in Vertex,&nbsp;

- [00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_KWTkYXmRw&t=316) and the APIs and tools to quickly&nbsp; generate your own applications.&nbsp;

- [00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_KWTkYXmRw&t=322) Building bold AI requires a responsible approach. So let me hand it over to James to share more.&nbsp;

- [00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_KWTkYXmRw&t=329) Thanks.
