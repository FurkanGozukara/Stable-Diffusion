This app is built upon IndexTTS2 open source model. And this is a 0-shot voice cloning. Instant voice cloning without any training or LoRA etc. Just used an average quality 22 second audio reference. You will see it at the end of the video.

Hopefully full tutorial coming soon

The app works locally on Windows, and Linux

Also you can run on Massed Compute and RunPod as usual if you are GPU poor

As low as 8 GB GPUs should run fairly well, lower may work too



### Video Transcription


- [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbgFVKWB7hs&t=0) Today I am going to introduce&nbsp; you Index TTS Premium. Built&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbgFVKWB7hs&t=4) by SECourses. 1-click to install on&nbsp; Windows, RunPod and Massed Compute.

- [00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbgFVKWB7hs&t=10) We handle all the installation&nbsp; for you with all pre-compiled&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbgFVKWB7hs&t=12) libraries so it works amazing on&nbsp; all GPUs such as RTX 2000 series,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbgFVKWB7hs&t=17) 3000 series, 4000 series or 5000 series.&nbsp; We support literally every GPU out there.

- [00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbgFVKWB7hs&t=24) With as low as 8 GB GPU, you can run&nbsp; this amazing app on your local computer&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbgFVKWB7hs&t=30) and generate amazing extremely&nbsp; high quality cloned voice audio.

- [00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbgFVKWB7hs&t=34) Cloning voice with this model&nbsp; is insanely easy and also good.

- [00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbgFVKWB7hs&t=38) This is the version 1 release of the app and&nbsp; hopefully many more features coming soon.

- [00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbgFVKWB7hs&t=44) For example some of the upcoming&nbsp; features are as: save and load presets,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbgFVKWB7hs&t=49) number of multiple generations, saving&nbsp; full metadata of each generation,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbgFVKWB7hs&t=53) continue generating a big text, give&nbsp; reference audio from path and such.

- [00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbgFVKWB7hs&t=57) Since this app is so good at the moment,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbgFVKWB7hs&t=60) this will be our number 1 text to speech&nbsp; app for a while until a better one arrives.

- [00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbgFVKWB7hs&t=64) With this amazing app, you&nbsp; can literally generate an&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbgFVKWB7hs&t=67) entire audio book with a single click of a button.

- [00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbgFVKWB7hs&t=70) It automatically intelligently splits given&nbsp; text into parts and process every one of them.

- [00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbgFVKWB7hs&t=76) When you provide a very long text, it will process&nbsp; it part by part and combine audio at the end.

- [00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbgFVKWB7hs&t=82) The audio and voice will be extremely coherent&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbgFVKWB7hs&t=84) and stable. That is what makes this&nbsp; app and model different than others.

- [00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbgFVKWB7hs&t=89) Also if you want a very clean voice,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbgFVKWB7hs&t=91) give as an input a very clean voice.&nbsp; It makes huge difference and impact.

- [00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbgFVKWB7hs&t=96) The length of the text doesnt matter&nbsp; since it is processed as chunks.

- [00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbgFVKWB7hs&t=99) All generated voices will be saved&nbsp; inside outputs folder automatically.

- [00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbgFVKWB7hs&t=103) For lower memory GPUs, enable&nbsp; Low Memory Mode checkbox.

- [00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbgFVKWB7hs&t=108) The speed of the generation is also insane. It&nbsp; is like 100 seconds audio generation takes 25&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbgFVKWB7hs&t=114) seconds. Of course this depends on GPU but&nbsp; you can get this speed with consumer GPUs.

- [00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbgFVKWB7hs&t=121) Now i will play the original voice&nbsp; used for voice cloning to generate&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbgFVKWB7hs&t=126) this audio so you can see how&nbsp; high quality this speech was.

- [00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbgFVKWB7hs&t=129) I have also provided this used reference audio as&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbgFVKWB7hs&t=132) a demo audio in the zip file&nbsp; so you can use and replicate.

- [00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbgFVKWB7hs&t=135) Original audio is a real audio taken from&nbsp; an interview. the uh Neuralink device is&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbgFVKWB7hs&t=140) kind of like a a fitbit or an Apple Watch um&nbsp; that's uh where where we we we take out a a&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbgFVKWB7hs&t=148) sort of a a small section of skull about the&nbsp; size of a quarter, um replace that with uh&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbgFVKWB7hs&t=152) what in many ways really is very much like um uh&nbsp; Fitbit, Apple Watch or or something like that.
