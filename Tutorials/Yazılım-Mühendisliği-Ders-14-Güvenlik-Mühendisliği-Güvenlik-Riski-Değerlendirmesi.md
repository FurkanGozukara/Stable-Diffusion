- [00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=6) welcome to our 14th software engineer course. The topic of today's lesson is security

- [00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=9) topic of today's lesson is security engineering. This will be our last lesson.

- [00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=12) engineering. This will be our last lesson.

- [00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=17) Thank you for following our lesson on software engineering.

- [00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=21) Topics covered in the meat section include security engineering and security management. Security engineering infrastructure and security management are related to applications.

- [00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=24) security management. Security engineering infrastructure and security management are related to applications.

- [00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=28) Security risk assessment is

- [00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=30) assessment is based on security risk assessment. Designing a system based on security risk assessment.

- [00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=32) based on security risk assessment. Designing a system based on security risk assessment. Designing for

- [00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=34) Designing for security. How to design system architectures for security.

- [00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=36) security. How to design system architectures for security. Security

- [00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=40) Security engineering is a field that can be listened to by malicious attacks aimed at harming a computer-based

- [00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=43) engineering is a field that can be listened to by malicious attacks aimed at harming a computer-based system or its data.

- [00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=45) system or its data.

- [00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=55) Tools, techniques, and methods to support the development and maintenance of systems that can be listened to. This is a security engineer. Okay,

- [00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=58) security engineer. Okay, one of the more comprehensive friends.

- [00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=60) one of the more comprehensive friends. This assumes background knowledge about reliability and

- [00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=64) This assumes background knowledge about reliability and security concepts in Lesson 10 and the security

- [00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=66) security concepts in Lesson 10 and the security requirements specification in Lesson 12. We've

- [00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=68) requirements specification in Lesson 12. We've

- [00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=75) already covered application infrastructure security. Application security is

- [00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=78) security. Application security is

- [00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=82) a software engineering problem where the system is designed to be listened to by attacks.

- [00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=86) So, for the application to be secure, you

- [00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=92) need to design the system from the very beginning to be able to be attacked.

- [00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=94) attacked. See, the infrastructure is configured here.

- [00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=96) See, the infrastructure is configured here. These

- [00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=98) These two concepts are important systems management

- [00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=101) two concepts are important systems management issues. The focus of this course is the

- [00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=105) issues. The focus of this course is the application is secure, not the infrastructure. In other words, the infrastructure

- [00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=107) application is secure, not the infrastructure. In other words, the infrastructure is doing it. What if the application actually

- [00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=110) is doing it. What if the application actually worked? The operating system

- [00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=112) worked? The operating system is Windows. If you don't want that, firewalls.

- [00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=114) is Windows. If you don't want that, firewalls. For example, what are these? These are infrastructure-related

- [00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=117) For example, what are these? These are infrastructure-related elements that can provide security.

- [00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=120) elements that can provide security. Yes, security can be compromised.

- [00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=122) Yes, security can be compromised.

- [00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=130) Look carefully at the system layers. What's at the top? Baran, the application itself. If

- [00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=133) application itself. If the application itself is not secure, you

- [00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=137) the application itself is not secure, you

- [00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=146) can encounter serious problems from the very beginning. So, other layers come after that. Go to the message. What is the

- [00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=149) other layers come after that. Go to the message. What is the second layer? R110 companies and

- [00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=153) second layer? R110 companies and İbrahim. Reusable

- [00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=155) İbrahim. Reusable components and libraries.

- [00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=159) components and libraries. We use these, but these are Open Source.

- [00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=161) We use these, but these are Open Source. Security vulnerabilities generally don't exist,

- [00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=164) Security vulnerabilities generally don't exist, or if they do, updates come immediately. They

- [00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=168) or if they do, updates come immediately. They come quickly and easily.

- [00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=172) come quickly and easily.

- [00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=179) Can we prevent errors, disabled vulnerabilities by updating? And so, the communication layers are the middle layers.

- [00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=183) so, the communication layers are the middle layers. Then, what's underneath that?

- [00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=186) Then, what's underneath that? Database design and management, and

- [00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=189) Database design and management, and when it's crushed, database management,

- [00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=191) when it's crushed, database management, generally,

- [00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=193) generally, but it's trouble-free. If you

- [00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=196) but it's trouble-free. If you don't make a serious mistake, what's underneath that? Of

- [00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=199) don't make a serious mistake, what's underneath that? Of course, Kecheese browsers,

- [00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=202) course, Kecheese browsers, email, and similar browsers are

- [00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=206) email, and similar browsers are completely independent of you. Why? Because

- [00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=210) completely independent of you. Why? Because everyone uses certain browsers.

- [00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=211) everyone uses certain browsers. I use Google Chrome right away. I have to assume that Google

- [00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=213) I use Google Chrome right away. I have to assume that Google Chrome has taken various security measures.

- [00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=217) Chrome has taken various security measures.

- [00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=222) I assume what's underneath them and the operating system is back. This is

- [00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=224) operating system is back. This is independent of me. Because I develop the operating system. If

- [00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=226) independent of me. Because I develop the operating system. If

- [00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=232) Microsoft doesn't take sufficient security measures, my system will be vulnerable no matter what I do.

- [00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=235) doesn't take sufficient security measures, my system will be vulnerable no matter what I do. But the most important

- [00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=238) But the most important layer is the application itself. First and foremost,

- [00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=240) layer is the application itself. First and foremost, I have written it myself. I

- [00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=243) I have written it myself. I need to make it very secure. No, I

- [00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=246) need to make it very secure. No, I need to develop it securely. Then

- [00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=248) need to develop it securely. Then come the other layers, as we explained,

- [00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=256) and security management. User and permission management.

- [00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=260) Adding and removing users to the system and setting appropriate permissions for users. In other words, each

- [00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=264) setting appropriate permissions for users. In other words, each user must have their own security level.

- [00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=269) user must have their own security level. And let's say, access levels.

- [00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=272) And let's say, access levels. This needs to be taken very seriously.

- [00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=275) This needs to be taken very seriously.

- [00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=279) Even if our users are company employees, even if they are people you trust very much. You

- [00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=282) even if they are people you trust very much. You should not trust anyone. When we develop software, you

- [00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=284) should not trust anyone. When we develop software, you

- [00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=290) should not trust anyone. This is the distribution, maintenance, installation of

- [00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=292) distribution, maintenance, installation of application software and middleware to avoid security vulnerabilities,

- [00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=294) application software and middleware to avoid security vulnerabilities, and the

- [00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=296) and the configuration of these systems. Look, it

- [00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=298) configuration of these systems. Look, it was easy to hack recently.

- [00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=300) was easy to hack recently. Do you know where this happened? This

- [00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=301) Do you know where this happened? This happened in the software update system. So,

- [00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=304) happened in the software update system. So,

- [00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=308) when you download software, install it, whatever happens, the update comes, this update is distributed,

- [00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=310) comes, this update is distributed, there is a server here.

- [00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=313) there is a server here. What are they waiting for? What do they do after that?

- [00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=315) What are they waiting for? What do they do after that? Through this update layer,

- [00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=318) Through this update layer, through distribution,

- [00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=320) through distribution, they send viruses to people,

- [00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=322) they send viruses to people, they install viruses, at least

- [00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=325) they install viruses, at least they install malware. This is it.

- [00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=328) they install malware. This is it. Software distribution and maintenance are also very important,

- [00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=331) Software distribution and maintenance are also very important, because it must

- [00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=336) because it must connect to a remote server to receive software updates. It

- [00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=338) connect to a remote server to receive software updates. It can use various APIs,

- [00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=341) can use various APIs, etc. This is also very important. Attack

- [00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=344) etc. This is also very important. Attack monitoring, detection, and recovery are crucial. However, monitoring the system

- [00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=348) monitoring, detection, and recovery are crucial. However, monitoring the system against unauthorized access requires

- [00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=350) against unauthorized access requires vendors to

- [00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=352) vendors to design and develop backups and recovery.

- [00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=359) You must have a separate server where your own server is located. If it is completely compromised and

- [00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=363) your own server is located. If it is completely compromised and destroyed, you can perform a full restore from the backup server.

- [00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=367) destroyed, you can perform a full restore from the backup server.

- [00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=373) Monitoring is also very important. If unusual activity is detected using this software, you

- [00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=376) unusual activity is detected using this software, you

- [00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=382) can quickly take action against it. For example, using antivirus software is

- [00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=385) example, using antivirus software is very important. Monitoring against unauthorized access

- [00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=388) very important. Monitoring against unauthorized access

- [00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=393) is crucial for preventing attacks. Backup and recovery are important. As we mentioned, security risk management

- [00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=398) As we mentioned, security risk management and risk management systems are about

- [00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=401) and risk management systems are about

- [00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=405) assessing potential losses from attacks and balancing these losses against the costs of security procedures that can mitigate these losses.

- [00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=407) losses against the costs of security procedures that can mitigate these losses.

- [00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=415) Here's what we mean by "Happy," and we need to

- [00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=420) and we need to strike a balance here.

- [00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=422) strike a balance here.

- [00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=426) As we've discussed in previous lessons, we can't achieve unlimited security because the cost of doing so

- [00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=429) we can't achieve unlimited security because the cost of doing so doesn't prevent losses or

- [00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=432) doesn't prevent losses or profits.

- [00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=437) Risk management should be guided by a corporate security policy.

- [00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=440) be guided by a corporate security policy. Risk management includes the following. Look at the

- [00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=442) Risk management includes the following. Look at the corporate security policy. So,

- [00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=444) corporate security policy. So, your organization needs a security policy.

- [00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=446) your organization needs a security policy. Preliminary risk assessment,

- [00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=449) Preliminary risk assessment, that is, estimating the risk before it occurs.

- [00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=452) that is, estimating the risk before it occurs. We will see patterns in this and its

- [00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=842) system management on certain physically secured issues. Why, if you

- [00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=845) Why, if you grant such a permission as a control, that

- [00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=848) grant such a permission as a control, that malicious person

- [00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=850) malicious person must be physically present, which is very rare and

- [00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=852) must be physically present, which is very rare and very difficult. Not impossible, but very

- [00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=855) very difficult. Not impossible, but very difficult. This is feasible.

- [00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=858) difficult. This is feasible. How is the feasibility of this? Low implementation

- [00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=860) How is the feasibility of this? Low implementation cost. Because you can

- [00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=862) cost. Because you can only allow access within your institution to those who actually have the authority to do so,

- [00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=864) only allow access within your institution to those who actually have the authority to do so,

- [00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=868) and there's no cost with this. Since it's Artvin, they have to come to your institution anyway,

- [00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=871) have to come to your institution anyway, but care must be taken to ensure key distribution and

- [00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=873) but care must be taken to ensure key distribution and availability of keys in case of an emergency.

- [00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=875) availability of keys in case of an emergency. So, if necessary, remote

- [00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=878) So, if necessary, remote

- [00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=885) development can be allowed, even in rare cases, manually. You should know what the other threat is. An unauthorized user

- [00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=887) what the other threat is. An unauthorized user gains access to the system as a user and

- [00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=889) gains access to the system as a user and confidential information. This is very high

- [00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=891) confidential information. This is very high because patients' education levels

- [00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=895) because patients' education levels may be low, they

- [00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=897) may be low, they may be easily hacked, and the patient's password may

- [00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=899) may be easily hacked, and the patient's password may be compromised. So, isn't it

- [00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=902) be compromised. So, isn't it likely to be high? So,

- [00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=904) likely to be high? So, we can control this to prevent this. As

- [00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=907) we can control this to prevent this. As you've seen, a certain number of numbers,

- [00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=910) you've seen, a certain number of numbers, special characters, password lengths, etc. are

- [00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=912) special characters, password lengths, etc. are required so that passwords cannot be guessed and cannot be

- [00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=915) required so that passwords cannot be guessed and cannot be easily found. This is a control

- [00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=918) easily found. This is a control mechanism. But it's not sufficient. Another

- [00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=920) mechanism. But it's not sufficient. Another control mechanism could be that all

- [00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=922) control mechanism could be that all users are required to verify their identities using a biometric mechanism. For

- [00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=924) users are required to verify their identities using a biometric mechanism. For

- [00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=930) example, you can log in to the system with your finger. Of

- [00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=933) you can log in to the system with your finger. Of course, there

- [00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=936) course, there would be a situation like a hacker gaining the password, but

- [00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=939) would be a situation like a hacker gaining the password, but this system is used to monitor usage.

- [00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=941) this system is used to monitor usage. All changes to patient information are

- [00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=943) All changes to patient information are recorded daily. Others control. If

- [00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=947) recorded daily. Others control. If a malicious person catches up, they can

- [00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=949) a malicious person catches up, they can

- [00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=953) detect and restore changes to patient information. So, what is the feasibility? It's

- [00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=956) restore changes to patient information. So, what is the feasibility? It's technically feasible, but it's

- [00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=958) technically feasible, but it's a high-cost solution. Because magic,

- [00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=963) a high-cost solution. Because magic, for example, to obtain biometric information, you'll

- [00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=965) for example, to obtain biometric information, you'll need a device. The cost of that device is

- [00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=969) need a device. The cost of that device is likely due to user resistance.

- [00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=972) likely due to user resistance. Users

- [00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=974) Users know they don't want to provide geometric information. This might be difficult.

- [00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=980) know they don't want to provide geometric information. This might be difficult. What is the feasibility of the first application, the

- [00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=986) What is the feasibility of the first application, the biometric event? The other is to

- [00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=989) biometric event? The other is to monitor system usage. To stay

- [00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=990) monitor system usage. To stay informed quickly, record changes daily.

- [00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=992) informed quickly, record changes daily. This is simple and transparent to implement

- [00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=994) This is simple and transparent to implement and also supports recovery.

- [00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=996) and also supports recovery. This can be easily

- [00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=999) This can be easily done. Yes, security

- [00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=1007) credit personnel at the beginning of a clinic session.

- [00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=1019) After the A101 clinic session is completed, patient information from system clients should

- [00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=1021) patient information from system clients should not be kept.

- [00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=1024) not be kept. This system requires all changes made to the

- [00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=1027) This system requires all changes made to the database server, and

- [00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=1029) database server, and a log should be kept on a separate computer.

- [00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=1067) can obtain information from all of these and evaluate them. Therefore,

- [00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=1071) evaluate them. Therefore,

- [00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=1074) security vulnerabilities arising from design choices can be identified. Now that we are in practice, we

- [00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=1579) When designing a security architecture, two fundamental issues must be considered. Let's see what these issues are.

- [00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=1581) must be considered. Let's see what these issues are.

- [00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=1591) How should the system be organized to protect critical assets against external attacks? Deployment is successful.

- [00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=1593) Deployment is successful.

- [00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=1597) How should system assets be distributed to minimize the effects of an attack? These potentially conflicting

- [00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=1600) These potentially conflicting assets are more expensive to protect if distributed. If

- [00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=1602) assets are more expensive to protect if distributed. If assets are protected,

- [00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=1603) assets are protected, availability and performance

- [00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=1604) availability and performance requirements may be compromised. Now,

- [00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=1608) requirements may be compromised. Now, let's look at the details of protection. Next, we'll look

- [00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=1610) let's look at the details of protection. Next, we'll look at the protection on

- [00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=1612) at the protection on the platform on which a system runs.

- [00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=1614) the platform on which a system runs. Controls on the

- [00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=1617) Controls on the application itself.

- [00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=1619) application itself. For example, additional password

- [00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=1621) For example, additional password protection. Protection on the registry.

- [00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=1624) protection. Protection on the registry. Access to specific information.

- [00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=1624) Access to specific information. This protection invoked. These lead to a layered

- [00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=1628) This protection invoked. These lead to a layered protection architecture. Let me

- [00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=1632) protection architecture. Let me give you an example.

- [00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=1635) give you an example. When you ask for saved passwords, what

- [00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=1637) When you ask for saved passwords, what does it ask you

- [00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=1643) does it ask you to enter your Windows login password?

- [00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=1651) I'll give you an example here. When I click on this passport and say "checkpas sos"

- [00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=1658) click on this passport and say "checkpas sos" and when I say "that pass" here,

- [00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=1665) and when I say "that pass" here, what does it ask me to do? It asks, see, Windows

- [00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=1668) what does it ask me to do? It asks, see, Windows OS asks me to enter my password.

- [00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=1671) OS asks me to enter my password. What is this? Break system protection.

- [00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=1673) What is this? Break system protection. So, suppose I forget it for a moment on the computer

- [00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=1676) So, suppose I forget it for a moment on the computer with ulterior motives. But

- [00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=1678) with ulterior motives. But someone came to me with a password. Ramo. But they

- [00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=1681) someone came to me with a password. Ramo. But they wanted to look, but they

- [00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=1684) wanted to look, but they didn't know the system password.

- [00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=1686) didn't know the system password. What will happen? You won't be able to access it.

- [00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=1690) What will happen? You won't be able to access it. A multi-layered protection architecture.

- [00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=1694) A multi-layered protection architecture. Platform-level protections. Systematic.

- [00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=1811) At least, what's in advance? So, distributing patient records here. Distribution,

- [00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=1815) distributing patient records here. Distribution, my first language, is

- [00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=1819) my first language, is a bit different from distribution.

- [00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=1822) a bit different from distribution. Distribution means that attacks on a system do not

- [00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=1823) Distribution means that attacks on a system do not necessarily

- [00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=1825) necessarily lead to a complete loss of system service.

- [00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=1827) lead to a complete loss of system service. So, what do we mean here?

- [00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=1831) So, what do we mean here?

- [00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=1835) We distribute the services we provide to different servers. The Steam platform

- [00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=1848) risk of denial of service attacks is high, and distribution is particularly important. So,

- [00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=1854) distribution is particularly important. So, what's here?

- [00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=1857) what's here? There are assets distributed in an equity trading system.

- [00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=1860) There are assets distributed in an equity trading system. Look what they've done. They've established a New York

- [00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=1863) Look what they've done. They've established a New York Trading system, a New York Trading

- [00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=1866) Trading system, a New York Trading system.

- [00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=1868) system. They've established a London Trading system. They

- [00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=1870) They've established a London Trading system. They

- [00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=1874) 've stored American accounts that I'll use in the New York Trading system. They've stored international user accounts.

- [00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=1876) international user accounts.

- [00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=1887) They've stored American or American accounts. They've stored the history of commercial transactions. They've stored American assets for sale, and so on.

- [00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=1890) They've stored American assets for sale, and so on. Look, in London, England, they've stored

- [00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=1893) Look, in London, England, they've stored accounts and assets of people in England.

- [00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=1895) accounts and assets of people in England. Then there's

- [00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=1899) Then there's Frankfurt, and Europeans have stored them in

- [00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=1902) Frankfurt, and Europeans have stored them in Hong Kong. They're hidden in Hong Kong. So, they've

- [00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=1904) Hong Kong. They're hidden in Hong Kong. So, they've implemented an asset distribution. That's why

- [00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=1907) implemented an asset distribution. That's why the system in America, if it's hacked,

- [00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=1910) the system in America, if it's hacked, won't affect those in other countries.

- [00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=1912) won't affect those in other countries.

- [00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=1916) You always hear about user passwords, emails, etc.

- [00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=1919) passwords, emails, etc. being added, but credit card information

- [00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=1921) being added, but credit card information not being added. Because credit card

- [00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=1924) not being added. Because credit card information is stored in a different

- [00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=1927) information is stored in a different and more secure system.

- [00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=1928) and more secure system. So, even if the main system is added,

- [00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=1933) So, even if the main system is added,

- [00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=1937) they may never have manually processed credit card information. What is that? That's asset distribution. The

- [00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=1944) key points of Brevet Part 1 are security engineering. It deals with

- [00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=1946) engineering. It deals with how to develop systems that can be eavesdropped on malicious attacks. The

- [00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=1947) how to develop systems that can be eavesdropped on malicious attacks. The

- [00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=1954) first rule, as I always say, is to assume that everyone who accesses a system and uses the system has

- [00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=1956) accesses a system and uses the system has malicious intent.

- [00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=1959) malicious intent. This is our only rule:

- [00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=1962) This is our only rule:

- [00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=1969) never trust any input you receive from outside. Security threats can be threats to the integrity and availability of a system or data.

- [00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=1971) threats can be threats to the integrity and availability of a system or data.

- [00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=1976) See, we mentioned integrity here. The word "integrity"

- [00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=1981) The word "integrity" would be more accurate.

- [00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=1983) would be more accurate. This is uncorrupted, unaltered,

- [00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=2041) increase the likelihood of security vulnerabilities. System survivability, that is, the system's continued

- [00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=2044) System survivability, that is, the system's continued survival, allows the system to

- [00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=2047) survival, allows the system to provide essential services

- [00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=2049) provide essential services even when under attack. Even under attack, the

- [00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=2052) even when under attack. Even under attack, the most critical operations continue. If we

- [00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=2055) most critical operations continue. If we can allow this, this

- [00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=2060) can allow this, this would be a very positive element. Let's look at the

- [00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=2064) would be a very positive element. Let's look at the design guidelines for security engineers for self-engineering.

- [00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=2066) design guidelines for security engineers for self-engineering. Ergene

- [00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=2071) gave me the guidelines, and I'll press them. These guidelines cover good practices in security system design. They

- [00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=2073) good practices in security system design. They

- [00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=2078) serve two purposes: they raise awareness of security issues within a software engineering team.

- [00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=2080) of security issues within a software engineering team. More precisely,

- [00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=2083) More precisely, one of them is security. But when design decisions are made, these design guidelines

- [00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=2085) one of them is security. But when design decisions are made, these design guidelines are considered. These

- [00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=2088) are considered. These

- [00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=2097) can be used as the basis for a review checklist applied during the system validation process. Are the design guidelines here valid during software specification and

- [00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=2098) guidelines here valid during software specification and design?

- [00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=2102) design? Yes, look. Yes, security.

- [00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=2111) Yes, look. Yes, security. Design guidelines for secure systems engineers.

- [00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=2112) Design guidelines for secure systems engineers. Security guidelines. Let's see

- [00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=2115) Security guidelines. Let's see what I base my security decisions on

- [00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=2117) what I base my security decisions on a clear security policy. So, let's

- [00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=2119) a clear security policy. So, let's have a security policy. Avoid a single

- [00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=2121) have a security policy. Avoid a single point of failure. If

- [00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=2123) point of failure. If multiple points of failure

- [00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=2126) multiple points of failure occur simultaneously, your system

- [00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=2128) occur simultaneously, your system will fail safely.

- [00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=2131) will fail safely. Even when the system succeeds, it

- [00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=2134) Even when the system succeeds, it

- [00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=2147) will prevent Android and Velog Lion from becoming insecure again. Balance security and usability. If we

- [00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=2150) usability. If we

- [00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=2154) sacrifice usability for security, we can create negative feedback. We

- [00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=2156) we can create negative feedback. We need a balance. Log user transactions, that

- [00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=2160) need a balance. Log user transactions, that is, keep long-line records.

- [00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=2162) is, keep long-line records.

- [00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=2167) Use leftover cake varieties to reduce the old ones. What we've explained with diversity?

- [00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=2170) we've explained with diversity? Verify all inputs. As I always say,

- [00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=2172) Verify all inputs. As I always say, never trust users.

- [00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=2175) never trust users. Segment our assets.

- [00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=2179) Segment our assets. Design for distribution.

- [00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=2182) Design for distribution. Design for recoverable and recoverable. Now

- [00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=2186) Design for recoverable and recoverable. Now

- [00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=2191) let's examine the technical guidelines in more detail. I base my decisions on an open information factory. Because I define

- [00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=2193) factory. Because I define

- [00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=2199) a security policy for the organization that defines the basic security requirements that must be implemented in enterprise systems. Avoid a single

- [00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=2201) a single point of failure. Ensure that a security

- [00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=2203) point of failure. Ensure that a security error occurs only when

- [00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=2205) error occurs only when multiple failures occur in security procedures.

- [00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=2207) multiple failures occur in security procedures.

- [00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=2211) For example, implement paid and question-based authentication. What do you mean by "right?"?

- [00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=2214) authentication. What do you mean by "right?"? For example,

- [00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=2216) For example, you've seen it after signing up, like the name of your first pet.

- [00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=2220) you've seen it after signing up, like the name of your first pet. What would this be?

- [00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=2222) What would this be? Double security, yes, or a more secure reason like SMS plus

- [00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=2226) Double security, yes, or a more secure reason like SMS plus password.

- [00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=2229) password.

- [00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=2258) Balance security and usability in design guidelines 46. Try to avoid security procedures that circulate around the system's usage.

- [00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=2260) security procedures that circulate around the system's usage. Sometimes, you need to

- [00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=2263) Sometimes, you need to

- [00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=2267) consider a more secure system to make it more usable. A balance needs to be struck here.

- [00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=2270) A balance needs to be struck here. Log user actions daily.

- [00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=2272) Log user actions daily.

- [00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=2275) A user action log that can be analyzed daily to discover who did what should be kept and users

- [00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=2278) daily to discover who did what should be kept and users should be informed of such a log. They are

- [00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=2280) should be informed of such a log. They are less likely to behave indefinitely.

- [00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=2284) less likely to behave indefinitely.

- [00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=2289) Use redundancy and various methods to mitigate risk. Keep multiple copies of data. Use this type of infrastructure. Thus, the

- [00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=2291) Use this type of infrastructure. Thus, the Altepe vulnerability is not a single point of failure.

- [00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=2293) Altepe vulnerability is not a single point of failure. Design guidelines 7-10. Check that all

- [00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=2298) Design guidelines 7-10. Check that all entries are correct. To

- [00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=2300) entries are correct. To prevent unexpected entries from causing problems,

- [00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=2302) prevent unexpected entries from causing problems,

- [00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=2309) check that all entries are within the range. This means that you

- [00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=2315) have an expectation in various ways, whether it's for numbers or text. You need to check whether that expectation falls within the expected range.

- [00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=2319) that expectation falls within the expected range.

- [00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=2325) Separate our assets into sections. System assets will be in separate areas, and

- [00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=2327) assets will be in separate areas, and users can access

- [00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=2329) users can access only the information they need instead of the entire system.

- [00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=2330) only the information they need instead of the entire system.

- [00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=2336) Arrange attachments so that distribution design prevents distribution issues.

- [00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=2337) prevents distribution issues.

- [00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=2342) Designing for the recoverable League involves designing the system to simplify recoverability after a successful attack,

- [00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=2353) designing the distribution software for deployment,

- [00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=2357) configuring it to run in the operating environment, and configuring it for the operating system.

- [00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=2358) and configuring it for the operating system. At this stage,

- [00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=2361) At this stage, configuration errors can arise as a result of configuration errors.

- [00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=2363) configuration errors can arise as a result of configuration errors.

- [00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=2389) thing manufactured right now, you know. Our devices are now connected to the internet,

- [00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=2391) Our devices are now connected to the internet, and this is the most common reason

- [00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=2399) for these default settings. Let me explain.

- [00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=2401) explain. Security cameras are the most misused devices, for example.

- [00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=2404) Security cameras are the most misused devices, for example. They are connected to a network and

- [00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=2409) default settings are used. These are scanned with automatic software.

- [00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=2411) These are scanned with automatic software. Special software is installed in them.

- [00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=2413) Special software is installed in them. Because they are connected to the internet and

- [00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=2415) Because they are connected to the internet and have their own software, they can be

- [00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=3200) only within the family, and this is the most widely used method.

- [00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=3203) and this is the most widely used method. Perhaps this is also a method for

- [00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=3207) Perhaps this is also a method for recognizing transactions on a server.

- [00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=3210) recognizing transactions on a server. For an office, preserve read-only copies of transactions and

- [00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=3212) For an office, preserve read-only copies of transactions and

- [00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=3216) periodically compare them to check for read-only corruption.

- [00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=3221) To detect corruption, preserve the cryptographic checksum with all transaction records and

- [00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=3227) ensure the grip top competitor's total is very, very important, especially with digital evidence.

- [00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=3231) especially with digital evidence. This must be present so that the records

- [00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=3233) This must be present so that the records can be determined to be intact.

- [00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=3236) can be determined to be intact.

- [00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=3242) If recovery is necessary, provide a mechanism to replay

- [00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=3245) transactions from a specific time to reconstruct transactions.

- [00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=3249) For example, I take daily backups. Of course, if the backup is

- [00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=3251) Of course, if the backup is not available today,

- [00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=3255) not available today, there are various different methods. For example, there is Liverik et, so you

- [00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=3258) there are various different methods. For example, there is Liverik et, so you can do live cloning, but

- [00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=3261) can do live cloning, but on a different water table. Maybe

- [00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=3264) on a different water table. Maybe it can slow down a bit. So, here

- [00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuwHYUSn9DA&t=3266) it can slow down a bit. So, here are various methods depending on the sensitivity of your system.
