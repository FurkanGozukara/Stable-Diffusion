Cloning a hard drive or solid state drive (HDD/SSD) can be a useful way to upgrade to a larger storage capacity or to create a backup of your current system. While there are several tools available for this task, one that stands out is Macrium Reflect. This software offers a free trial version that allows you to clone your HDD/SSD. In this tutorial, we will walk you through the steps to clone your Windows HDD/SSD to a new or larger HDD/NVMe SSD using Macrium Reflect, as well as how to use the custom .NET C# application developed by SECourses for full file verification.

Open Macrium Reflect on your computer.

In the left panel, select the HDD/SSD that you want to clone.

Click the "Clone this disk" button in the toolbar.

In the "Clone Disk" window, select the new or larger HDD/NVMe SSD as the destination disk.

Click the "Clone" button to start the cloning process.

Wait for the cloning process to complete. This may take some time, depending on the size of your drive and the speed of your computer.

After the cloning process is finished, you can use the custom .NET C# application developed by SECourses to verify that all of your files have been transferred successfully

In conclusion, cloning your HDD/SSD to a new or larger drive can be a quick and easy way to upgrade your storage capacity or create a backup of your current system. By using the Macrium Reflect software and the custom .NET C# application developed by SECourses, you can ensure that the cloning process goes smoothly and that all of your files are transferred correctly.

Cloning an NVMe M.2 SSD (Solid State Drive) can be a useful task for a variety of reasons. Perhaps you want to upgrade to a larger capacity drive, or you want to create a backup of your existing drive in case of data loss. Whatever the reason, the process of cloning an NVMe M.2 SSD is relatively straightforward, but it does require some preparation and caution.

Step 1: Install and open the cloning software on your computer.

Step 2: Follow the prompts to select the source drive (the M.2 NVMe SSD that you want to clone) and the destination drive (the second M.2 NVMe SSD).

Step 3: Review the details of the clone process to ensure that everything is correct, including the size of the source and destination drives and the location of the destination drive.

Step 4: Begin the cloning process. This may take some time, depending on the size of the drive and the speed of your computer. Be sure not to interrupt the process or turn off your computer.

Step 5: Once the cloning process is complete, safely remove the destination M.2 NVMe SSD from your computer and store it in a safe place.

- [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdBRcnabV6s&t=0) Greetings everyone.

- [00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdBRcnabV6s&t=1) In this video I am going to show you how you can clone your current drive into a newly

- [00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdBRcnabV6s&t=7) purchased drive.

- [00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdBRcnabV6s&t=8) Currently, I own SanDisk Ultra M.2 NVMe SSD.

- [00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdBRcnabV6s&t=14) It is almost full.

- [00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdBRcnabV6s&t=15) Let me show you.

- [00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdBRcnabV6s&t=16) You see, I almost have no space left.

- [00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdBRcnabV6s&t=18) So I have purchased a new drive, which is Kingston 2TB NV2.

- [00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdBRcnabV6s&t=25) Let me also show their features from CrystalDiskMark Info.

- [00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdBRcnabV6s&t=28) So this is my current drive.

- [00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdBRcnabV6s&t=31) These are the features that I have been using and this is my new drive.

- [00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdBRcnabV6s&t=35) So which software are we going to use?

- [00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdBRcnabV6s&t=37) We are going to use Macrium Software.

- [00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdBRcnabV6s&t=39) It's a free trial.

- [00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdBRcnabV6s&t=41) Free trial is going to be sufficient for us.

- [00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdBRcnabV6s&t=44) So I click it download and let's just click continue and it is getting downloaded.

- [00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdBRcnabV6s&t=50) It has been downloaded.

- [00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdBRcnabV6s&t=51) I think it will download from internet.

- [00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdBRcnabV6s&t=53) So I am going to do anything.

- [00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdBRcnabV6s&t=55) No, I don't need to do anything.

- [00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdBRcnabV6s&t=57) So first it has downloaded a downloader.

- [00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdBRcnabV6s&t=60) Then we click download.

- [00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdBRcnabV6s&t=62) It starts downloading.

- [00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdBRcnabV6s&t=63) Okay, so the download has been completed.

- [00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdBRcnabV6s&t=65) So you see this is version 8.0 and other things.

- [00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdBRcnabV6s&t=68) So let's click next.

- [00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdBRcnabV6s&t=70) It is getting installed.

- [00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdBRcnabV6s&t=73) Okay, accept.

- [00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdBRcnabV6s&t=74) Okay, we are going to use 30 day trial.

- [00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdBRcnabV6s&t=78) Okay, it's fine.

- [00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdBRcnabV6s&t=80) No, I am not going to register.

- [00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdBRcnabV6s&t=83) Okay, so okay, we don't need these two options, because we are going to do just cloning.

- [00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdBRcnabV6s&t=89) Yes, you can make a shortcut.

- [00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdBRcnabV6s&t=92) Let's click install.

- [00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdBRcnabV6s&t=94) Okay, the installation has been completed.

- [00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdBRcnabV6s&t=97) So I am going to launch now.

- [00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdBRcnabV6s&t=99) Okay, and yes.

- [00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdBRcnabV6s&t=102) So this is our screen.

- [00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdBRcnabV6s&t=104) Okay, this is important that how you are going to clone.

- [00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdBRcnabV6s&t=110) So you see the first disk, which is my current C drive.

- [00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdBRcnabV6s&t=116) It shows everything regarding that has four partitions and it is important that you need

- [00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdBRcnabV6s&t=122) to copy all of, clone all of the partitions into a new drive so that you can load windows

- [00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdBRcnabV6s&t=127) directly from that partition.

- [00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdBRcnabV6s&t=130) And disk 2 is my new drive you see Kingston SVNG2S2000G.

- [00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdBRcnabV6s&t=139) You see, it is currently unformatted and it is not allocated.

- [00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdBRcnabV6s&t=146) So this is the drive I am going to clone and when I click this thing, this drive, it shows

- [00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdBRcnabV6s&t=153) me actions and there is clone disk.

- [00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdBRcnabV6s&t=158) I'm clicking clone disk.

- [00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdBRcnabV6s&t=160) So you see all of the partitions are selected.

- [00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdBRcnabV6s&t=163) Now it is asking me to select a disk to clone.

- [00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdBRcnabV6s&t=166) This is really important: you to select correct disks.

- [00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdBRcnabV6s&t=171) So this is my source disk and as a target disk, I am going to select disk 2.

- [00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdBRcnabV6s&t=176) Okay, and I am going to use copy partitions.

- [00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdBRcnabV6s&t=182) Okay, currently all the partitions are selected and you see there is copy selected partitions

- [00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdBRcnabV6s&t=188) when I click next.

- [00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdBRcnabV6s&t=189) There is also advanced options and you don't need to change anything there.

- [00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdBRcnabV6s&t=193) So let's click next.

- [00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdBRcnabV6s&t=196) And in here no I don't need any scheduling, so click next.

- [00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdBRcnabV6s&t=201) Okay, let's check out the information once again, because this is not reversible.

- [00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdBRcnabV6s&t=206) The source disk is my C drive.

- [00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdBRcnabV6s&t=209) The destination is the disk that I have just purchased.

- [00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdBRcnabV6s&t=211) New disk.

- [00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdBRcnabV6s&t=212) We are using intelligent sector copy, Verify, Delta, SSD Trim.

- [00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdBRcnabV6s&t=216) We don't need power saving or other things.

- [00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdBRcnabV6s&t=219) We don't need schedulers.

- [00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdBRcnabV6s&t=221) So there are operation 4 operations.

- [00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdBRcnabV6s&t=224) It is going to copy all of the partitions.

- [00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdBRcnabV6s&t=227) You see the first partition, second partition, third partition and the fourth partition.

- [00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdBRcnabV6s&t=233) And in the fourth partition is it going to extend?

- [00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdBRcnabV6s&t=237) Okay, I think Okay, and let me check once again.

- [00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdBRcnabV6s&t=242) Oh, oh, there is one more thing.

- [00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdBRcnabV6s&t=245) You see this part is left as unused, but I want to use this part as well.

- [00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdBRcnabV6s&t=252) Okay for also using this unused space.

- [00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdBRcnabV6s&t=255) This is really important.

- [00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdBRcnabV6s&t=257) I am clicking this main section.

- [00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdBRcnabV6s&t=260) You see it is 930 GB and I am going to click fill space.

- [00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdBRcnabV6s&t=267) Expand selected partition to fill the available space.

- [00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdBRcnabV6s&t=270) And now, yes, it is filled.

- [00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdBRcnabV6s&t=272) I don't need to change these first three partitions.

- [00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdBRcnabV6s&t=277) That has been generated automatically by my windows installer for the first time when

- [00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdBRcnabV6s&t=282) I have installed the Windows.

- [00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdBRcnabV6s&t=284) And now we are ready.

- [00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdBRcnabV6s&t=285) Next, we don't need scheduling.

- [00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdBRcnabV6s&t=286) Next, okay, you see the start sector and the ending sector is now correct.

- [00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdBRcnabV6s&t=291) Okay, everything looking good.

- [00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdBRcnabV6s&t=294) Let's just click finish.

- [00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdBRcnabV6s&t=295) Run this backup now.

- [00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdBRcnabV6s&t=296) Say okay.

- [00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdBRcnabV6s&t=297) It says that, do we need backup?

- [00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdBRcnabV6s&t=300) Okay?

- [00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdBRcnabV6s&t=301) Okay, it's fine.

- [00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdBRcnabV6s&t=303) Let's just okay.

- [00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdBRcnabV6s&t=306) Okay, you see it's now saying creating volume snapshots.

- [00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdBRcnabV6s&t=311) So first it will create a volume snapshot.

- [00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdBRcnabV6s&t=313) Then it will do the cloning.

- [00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdBRcnabV6s&t=316) Okay, and now it's starting.

- [00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdBRcnabV6s&t=319) Meanwhile cloning is being made.

- [00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdBRcnabV6s&t=323) You shouldn't do anything.

- [00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdBRcnabV6s&t=324) So now I am going to pause the video.

- [00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdBRcnabV6s&t=327) Okay, so the cloning has been completed.

- [00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdBRcnabV6s&t=329) You see it only, it only took one hour and 11 minutes.

- [00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdBRcnabV6s&t=333) Because both of the hard drives are super fast.

- [00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdBRcnabV6s&t=335) I am also going to release a video of comparing both hard drive speeds with multiple hard

- [00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdBRcnabV6s&t=343) drive speed test applications.

- [00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdBRcnabV6s&t=345) So you should also watch them if you are interested in, and I will put the link of it in the description.

- [00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdBRcnabV6s&t=350) So how we are going to reboot our computer with the new disk instead of our current c

- [00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdBRcnabV6s&t=357) drive.

- [00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdBRcnabV6s&t=358) There are two ways.

- [00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdBRcnabV6s&t=359) First way: you can remove your current c drive and replace it with the new drive.

- [00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdBRcnabV6s&t=365) Okay.

- [00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdBRcnabV6s&t=366) Alternatively, you can set your boot drive from the bios of your motherboard.

- [00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdBRcnabV6s&t=375) So I will restart the computer and show how can you, how you can do it.

- [00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdBRcnabV6s&t=381) But it may change according to your motherboard brand.

- [00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdBRcnabV6s&t=385) But before that I want to also explain another thing.

- [00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdBRcnabV6s&t=389) When you are doing cloning you should close as many as possible applications.

- [00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdBRcnabV6s&t=396) So while the clone is happening there shouldn't be new writings or modification to your c

- [00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdBRcnabV6s&t=402) drive.

- [00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdBRcnabV6s&t=404) Because of that purpose I have closed all of my MS SQL server.

- [00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdBRcnabV6s&t=410) Let me show you.

- [00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdBRcnabV6s&t=412) One moment.

- [00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdBRcnabV6s&t=415) I have closed MS SQL server agent and other several SQL server related things so that

- [00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdBRcnabV6s&t=420) because SQL server, almost any moment modify some database parameters, and do some operations.

- [00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdBRcnabV6s&t=430) So if you have such applications installed on your computer you should close them or

- [00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdBRcnabV6s&t=436) stop their services to ensure as much as possibly have the exact data.

- [00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdBRcnabV6s&t=443) Cloning in the DOS screen, in the DOS environment would be better option, but it requires paid

- [00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdBRcnabV6s&t=451) applications.

- [00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdBRcnabV6s&t=452) Okay, now I'm going to restart and show how am I going to set the booting drive.

- [00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdBRcnabV6s&t=458) Okay, this is the bios screen of my motherboard.

- [00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdBRcnabV6s&t=462) So I'm going to click settings and in here I have boot and in here you see UEFI hard

- [00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdBRcnabV6s&t=470) disk drive boots and the boot option one I am going to set as my new drive.

- [00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdBRcnabV6s&t=477) And that's it.

- [00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdBRcnabV6s&t=479) Let's just click yes, and it is supposed to boot and work right now.

- [00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdBRcnabV6s&t=486) Let's see.

- [00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdBRcnabV6s&t=487) Okay, so you see, I have now booted into my new drive.

- [00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdBRcnabV6s&t=493) My new drive is now the C drive, as you can see here.

- [00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdBRcnabV6s&t=496) It is 2 TB and when I right click and see properties, it is like this: and let's also

- [00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdBRcnabV6s&t=503) look at the properties of our previous drive, which is the now F drive.

- [00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdBRcnabV6s&t=508) Right click properties and these are the number of used space, capacity and other things.

- [00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdBRcnabV6s&t=515) However, if you want to be 100% sure that everything is copied perfectly, you are keeping

- [00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdBRcnabV6s&t=524) all of the files, then you need to use another application.

- [00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdBRcnabV6s&t=528) Since I am a .NET developer, I have programmed a simple application like this which compares

- [00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdBRcnabV6s&t=535) both of the given folders, drives, whatever, with all capabilities it has.

- [00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdBRcnabV6s&t=541) This is a complete.

- [00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdBRcnabV6s&t=543) This is a software completely coded by me.

- [00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdBRcnabV6s&t=547) It compares the SHA256 hashes, so this is a really dependable way to compare whether

- [00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdBRcnabV6s&t=557) they have been copied correct, correctly or not.

- [00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdBRcnabV6s&t=561) You see.

- [00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdBRcnabV6s&t=563) It is a decent size application actually.

- [00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdBRcnabV6s&t=567) So let's also run this application to see if we have, if we are missing, any files or

- [00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdBRcnabV6s&t=574) not.

- [00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdBRcnabV6s&t=576) I will run it as administrator, actually, so it will have more rights to check out all

- [00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdBRcnabV6s&t=582) of the files.

- [00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdBRcnabV6s&t=583) Okay.

- [00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdBRcnabV6s&t=584) The application interface is very simple and I click start verification.

- [00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdBRcnabV6s&t=591) First of all, it will check all of the file names from both folders.

- [00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdBRcnabV6s&t=595) It supports multithreading as well.

- [00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdBRcnabV6s&t=597) Actually, it supports one thread for the one of the drive and one another thread for the

- [00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdBRcnabV6s&t=603) one another drive.

- [00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdBRcnabV6s&t=605) So this is the number of files found in the first path which is c drive, and it is fetching

- [00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdBRcnabV6s&t=615) the second drive file names as well for comparison.

- [00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdBRcnabV6s&t=620) Okay, and if, okay.

- [00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdBRcnabV6s&t=623) So you.

- [00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdBRcnabV6s&t=624) So you see only there are two new files, different files, and it is fine.

- [00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdBRcnabV6s&t=628) It is comparing now all of the files hashes.

- [00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdBRcnabV6s&t=631) Okay, this is the most dependable way of sorry about that.

- [00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdBRcnabV6s&t=637) This is the most dependable way of comparing drives, whether they have been, whether they

- [00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdBRcnabV6s&t=646) have been correctly copied or not.

- [00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdBRcnabV6s&t=649) If the file is not properly copied from my initial drive to another drive, then their

- [00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdBRcnabV6s&t=656) hash values will not match, okay.

- [00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdBRcnabV6s&t=659) And we will be able to see them in the text file like this.

- [00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdBRcnabV6s&t=666) Currently there isn't zero nonmatching files.

- [00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdBRcnabV6s&t=670) Okay, I am going to put this software, upload this software to our Patreon page.

- [00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdBRcnabV6s&t=676) We have a Patreon page.

- [00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdBRcnabV6s&t=678) If you support us on our Patreon page.

- [00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdBRcnabV6s&t=688) us.

- [00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdBRcnabV6s&t=689) Please also subscribe, like and share this video, and the source code of this software

- [00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdBRcnabV6s&t=696) will be available on the Patreon for our beloved supporters.

- [00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdBRcnabV6s&t=701) But you can also.

- [00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdBRcnabV6s&t=703) Currently I am showing the entire code.

- [00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdBRcnabV6s&t=706) You can also type the code yourself by looking at it.

- [00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdBRcnabV6s&t=711) It is up to you.

- [00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdBRcnabV6s&t=712) Let me also show the entire code once again.

- [00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdBRcnabV6s&t=716) And yes, it is like this.

- [00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdBRcnabV6s&t=720) I hope you have enjoyed and with this software, then we will be sure that all of the files

- [00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdBRcnabV6s&t=727) in our initial drive have been properly and perfectly cloned into our new drive and then

- [00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdBRcnabV6s&t=735) we can continue to use our windows operating system as same as before.

- [00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdBRcnabV6s&t=743) Let's see how the application is going okay.

- [00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdBRcnabV6s&t=746) So you see it is checking all of the files.

- [00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdBRcnabV6s&t=748) We can also see that both of the disks are getting read and there is no writing actually

- [00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdBRcnabV6s&t=757) only getting read, like this: and this is the older drive, my 1 TB SanDisk Ultra 3D

- [00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdBRcnabV6s&t=764) M.2 SSD and this is my new drive, Kingstone.

- [00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdBRcnabV6s&t=769) As you can see, and this is how active they are currently.

- [00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdBRcnabV6s&t=774) End of the video.

- [00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdBRcnabV6s&t=775) I will also give support to those who become patron and join our discord channel and ask

- [00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdBRcnabV6s&t=781) questions about this software of mine.

- [00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdBRcnabV6s&t=785) So don't worry about that.

- [00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdBRcnabV6s&t=786) If you encounter any problems, if you can't make it work, I will upload both the compiled

- [00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdBRcnabV6s&t=791) exe and the source code so you can also download the Microsoft Visual Studio Community Edition.

- [00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdBRcnabV6s&t=796) It is for free and you can compile it yourself.

- [00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdBRcnabV6s&t=799) You can change the code yourself.

- [00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdBRcnabV6s&t=801) It is totally up to you.

- [00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdBRcnabV6s&t=803) Hopefully see you later in another video.
