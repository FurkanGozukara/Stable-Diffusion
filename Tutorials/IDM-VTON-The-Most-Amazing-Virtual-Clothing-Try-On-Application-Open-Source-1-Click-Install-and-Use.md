### Video Transcription


- [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pcIeAVQD0&t=0) Greetings everyone. Today I am going to introduce&nbsp; you to the newest open-source virtual try-on&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pcIeAVQD0&t=5) application, IDM-VTON. The features of IDM-VTON&nbsp; are just mind-blowing. It is extremely powerful,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pcIeAVQD0&t=12) robust, and flexible. With IDM-VTON, you can&nbsp; make any person try any clothing with extreme&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pcIeAVQD0&t=18) flexibility and extreme accuracy. How well the&nbsp; input image is matched with the input clothing&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pcIeAVQD0&t=25) is just mind-blowing. The quality is significant,&nbsp; and it is extremely robust and flexible; it even&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pcIeAVQD0&t=31) works on non-real characters such as this one.&nbsp; Based on your input image quality and your input&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pcIeAVQD0&t=37) clothing quality, you can get extremely accurate&nbsp; and extremely well-made images, as you are seeing&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pcIeAVQD0&t=43) right now. So today, I am going to show you how to&nbsp; install IDM-VTON on your computer with one click&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pcIeAVQD0&t=50) and use it with our advanced gradio application.&nbsp; So, as usual, we have all the instructions and&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pcIeAVQD0&t=56) installers in this post. The link to this post&nbsp; will be in the description of the video. Go to&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pcIeAVQD0&t=62) the very bottom, to the attachments, download&nbsp; "virtual try on version 4" file. We are currently&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pcIeAVQD0&t=68) working on fp8 and cpu offloading to significantly&nbsp; reduce the VRAM usage, speed up the generation,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pcIeAVQD0&t=76) and also make a free Kaggle notebook. It is not&nbsp; ready yet, but we are working on it. Move the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pcIeAVQD0&t=83) downloaded zip file anywhere, extract it, enter&nbsp; the extracted folder, and you will see that we&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pcIeAVQD0&t=89) have already Massed Compute installer and RunPod&nbsp; installer. Hopefully, I will make another tutorial&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pcIeAVQD0&t=96) to show you how to use this amazing application on&nbsp; RunPod or Massed Compute. To install for Windows,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pcIeAVQD0&t=103) all you need to do is double-click and&nbsp; run "windows install.bat" file. However,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pcIeAVQD0&t=109) for this to work, you need to have installed&nbsp; several things. First of all, you should&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pcIeAVQD0&t=113) have installed Python. When I type "python",&nbsp; you see I have 3.10.11. If you have multiple&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pcIeAVQD0&t=120) Python versions, but if you also have Python&nbsp; Launcher, it should still work. Additionally,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pcIeAVQD0&t=126) you also need to have installed Git. When you type&nbsp; "git", you see that Git is installed. Moreover,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pcIeAVQD0&t=132) C++ tools may be required. I am not sure because&nbsp; I already have installed it. So, if you don't&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pcIeAVQD0&t=138) know how to install C++ tools, you can watch this&nbsp; amazing tutorial to learn how to install Python,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pcIeAVQD0&t=143) Git, and C++ tools. The installation has been&nbsp; completed. Scroll to the top slowly and see if&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pcIeAVQD0&t=150) there are any errors that you are seeing. So make&nbsp; sure that everything is installed accurately, and&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pcIeAVQD0&t=156) there is one very important thing that you need&nbsp; to be aware of: initially, it is going to clone&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pcIeAVQD0&t=163) a repository that has over 1GB of model&nbsp; files, so the initial cloning will take time. You&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pcIeAVQD0&t=170) should see that "Git LFS initialized". This means&nbsp; that Git Large File Storage is initialized. If the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pcIeAVQD0&t=177) Git Large doesn't work, you can type "git large" into&nbsp; Google and download this Git Large File Storage.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pcIeAVQD0&t=184) After you have verified the installation, all&nbsp; you need to do is just double-click and start&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pcIeAVQD0&t=189) "Windows_Start_VTON_app.bat" file. It will&nbsp; automatically download the necessary models&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pcIeAVQD0&t=196) into your Hugging Face cache folder. Then it will&nbsp; start. These downloading models into the cache&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pcIeAVQD0&t=202) folder is only one time, and if you don't know&nbsp; how to set or change the path of your Hugging&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pcIeAVQD0&t=208) Face cache folder, you can type into Google "SECourses Hugging Face cache", and you will get&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pcIeAVQD0&t=213) this "Pixart Tutorial" and "Instantly Transfer&nbsp; Face IP Adapter Tutorial". In both tutorials,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pcIeAVQD0&t=219) I have explained how to set your Hugging Face&nbsp; cache folder. When you search the description of&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pcIeAVQD0&t=225) the videos, you will see "How to set your Hugging&nbsp; Face cache folder". So, after you double-clicked&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pcIeAVQD0&t=232) the Windows start file, it will automatically&nbsp; start and open this interface for you. Currently,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pcIeAVQD0&t=238) this interface is using the newest technology of&nbsp; Gradio, so there are several issues, but it is&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pcIeAVQD0&t=245) working pretty decently, and it will get better.&nbsp; To upload your input image, you need to click this&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pcIeAVQD0&t=251) icon, not here, because this is an editing tool.&nbsp; So this is a little bit different. Click this icon&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pcIeAVQD0&t=257) and then select your input image. For example,&nbsp; let's select this one. Then you can upload&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pcIeAVQD0&t=262) any garments, any clothing; it is working with&nbsp; everything. Let's upload, for example, this armor.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pcIeAVQD0&t=270) Then it wants you to slightly describe what the&nbsp; input clothing is. You can even leave this empty.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pcIeAVQD0&t=277) Let's say "a body armor". Then you will see these&nbsp; options. There are denoising steps, like we use&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pcIeAVQD0&t=283) in Automatic1111 Web UI. It is equally the steps&nbsp; count and the seed that you want to use. The seed&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pcIeAVQD0&t=291) has a significant impact on this application.&nbsp; Therefore, I have added a new feature to the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pcIeAVQD0&t=297) Gradio demo hosted on Hugging Face: "Number of&nbsp; images to generate". So generate a multiple number&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pcIeAVQD0&t=303) of images so that you will be able to pick the&nbsp; very best one. Let's generate 10 images. Moreover,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pcIeAVQD0&t=310) there is "Use auto generated mask" and "Use auto&nbsp; cropping and resizing". If you are not going to&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pcIeAVQD0&t=316) use these options, you need to mask the clothing&nbsp; yourself, and also, I suggest you use this&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pcIeAVQD0&t=322) resolution. The best resolution it works with is&nbsp; 768x1024. So if your input image and your clothing&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pcIeAVQD0&t=331) are 768x1024, it will work best. Moreover, the&nbsp; application is going to, by default, resize to&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pcIeAVQD0&t=338) 768x1024, if possible. You can also edit it. We&nbsp; haven't added the feature for you so that you&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pcIeAVQD0&t=346) can edit the app_VTON.py file. Let me&nbsp; show you. I will open it with Visual Studio Code&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pcIeAVQD0&t=351) editor here, then search for "768", and you will&nbsp; see that it is going to get resized to 768x1024,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pcIeAVQD0&t=360) but we may add custom resolution resizing.&nbsp; However, it is working very well this way. Then,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pcIeAVQD0&t=365) to see the progress, open back your CMD window,&nbsp; and this is the speed of image generation. So it&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pcIeAVQD0&t=372) is taking around 14 seconds on my RTX 3090. On&nbsp; Linux, it is faster. For example, I tested on&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pcIeAVQD0&t=380) RunPod RTX 4090, and it was taking only 5 seconds&nbsp; on the RTX 4090 GPU, but this is also pretty good,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pcIeAVQD0&t=389) and the images are generated. Let's see them. You&nbsp; can move between images like this and use the very&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pcIeAVQD0&t=395) best one that you like. You see, it is pretty&nbsp; much able to keep the original input clothing&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pcIeAVQD0&t=401) very well. It is amazing. It has generated&nbsp; this masking automatically for us. You can&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pcIeAVQD0&t=407) also generate the mask yourself, and these are the&nbsp; images. You see how much difference the seeding is&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pcIeAVQD0&t=413) making. Therefore, the addition of this "Number&nbsp; of images to generate" was super important.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pcIeAVQD0&t=420) Moreover, they are automatically saved inside&nbsp; the "outputs" folder. So click this button, and&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pcIeAVQD0&t=424) it will open the "outputs" folder. The "outputs"&nbsp; folder is inside the "IDM-VTON" folder, and you&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pcIeAVQD0&t=431) will see that the images are generated, and with&nbsp; the seed of them is displayed like this. So this&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pcIeAVQD0&t=436) was seed 10, seed 7, seed 8. So it will start&nbsp; from this seed and be incremented by one when you&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pcIeAVQD0&t=443) generate. So if you want to generate more images&nbsp; with a different seed, you can set this to 11,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pcIeAVQD0&t=447) and it will continue from 11. Sometimes, when you&nbsp; click "Try on" again, it may not work, especially&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pcIeAVQD0&t=454) I have seen that on RunPod and Massed Compute. So&nbsp; when you click "Try on", if it is not starting to&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pcIeAVQD0&t=460) generate a new image, currently also happening&nbsp; on my computer, there is a bug in Gradio. I have&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pcIeAVQD0&t=466) reported that. So what you need to do is very&nbsp; simple: click this icon, click here, then click&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pcIeAVQD0&t=471) this "Undo", and then you will be able to generate&nbsp; it. This is a bug of Gradio with this newest input&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pcIeAVQD0&t=479) field they have. I think they will fix it soon. So&nbsp; this is the way of fixing it without re-uploading&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pcIeAVQD0&t=485) the original image, and the image is generated.&nbsp; So let's make another example where we mask the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pcIeAVQD0&t=491) image ourselves. Click this upload icon, and this&nbsp; time, let's try this character. Maybe you know&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pcIeAVQD0&t=496) this character or not. This is from an anime, "One&nbsp; Punch Man". It's a very famous one. Let's also&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pcIeAVQD0&t=502) upload our clothing. Now, this image, I am going&nbsp; to mask it. Unfortunately, Gradio still doesn't&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pcIeAVQD0&t=508) have full screen for this, and it is not good.&nbsp; However, you see this is a very advanced input&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pcIeAVQD0&t=514) field they have made, but there is still no full&nbsp; screen. I don't know why they don't make such very&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pcIeAVQD0&t=520) important features, but I am using the zoom-in&nbsp; feature of the browser to zoom in. I also suggest&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pcIeAVQD0&t=526) you use Chrome with the Gradio applications.&nbsp; Chrome is working much better than others. So&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pcIeAVQD0&t=531) I am going to generate the mask myself. Let's set&nbsp; the mask size and mask the areas that you want to&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pcIeAVQD0&t=538) changed. So let's mask it like this. I'm not sure&nbsp; which mask will work best, but I am just making&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pcIeAVQD0&t=544) a rough mask that I want to be used. Okay, we got&nbsp; the masking. Then I'm going to undo the "Use auto&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pcIeAVQD0&t=553) generated mask" and just type what this is: "a&nbsp; black shirt", like this, and then hit "Try on",&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pcIeAVQD0&t=561) and let's see the result. And we got the image&nbsp; generated. However, since it auto-cropped the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pcIeAVQD0&t=567) input image into this one, this didn't yield the&nbsp; best result. So our mask is changed, and we got&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pcIeAVQD0&t=574) this image. So how can you fix it? You can fix it&nbsp; by modifying the input image. So how are we going&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pcIeAVQD0&t=580) to modify the input image? I am going to open this&nbsp; image like this with Paint.NET. Then I am going&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pcIeAVQD0&t=587) to get an area of it with the fixed ratio, which&nbsp; is 768x1024, and try to get the image. You see,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pcIeAVQD0&t=596) it is not possible to get that part. Your image&nbsp; should be like that to get it into an accurate&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pcIeAVQD0&t=604) dimension. So what can we do? We can do like this.&nbsp; Let's see. Let's make the height bigger like this.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pcIeAVQD0&t=611) Okay, and then we will see the difference&nbsp; of the input image resolution. All right,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pcIeAVQD0&t=618) and can we get it right now? Almost, yeah, like&nbsp; this. Okay, then let's save this as a new input,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pcIeAVQD0&t=625) like this. So this is with the ratio of 768x1024.&nbsp; Then let's remove this, upload the new image. It&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pcIeAVQD0&t=633) is saved inside the downloads folder. Then also&nbsp; mask this one. So let's select the masking like&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pcIeAVQD0&t=640) this. This is super important to learn how to&nbsp; use it. Okay, this mask was a little bit big,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pcIeAVQD0&t=645) but let's see the result. And we got the&nbsp; output image. This is looking very, very good&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pcIeAVQD0&t=651) when you consider the input image and the input&nbsp; clothing. Let's see it in Paint.NET. So you see,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pcIeAVQD0&t=657) the new clothing is applied to this image. So this&nbsp; is the way it works. It is extremely flexible and&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pcIeAVQD0&t=664) extremely powerful. It is able to almost keep very&nbsp; consistent output based on your image inputs. If&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pcIeAVQD0&t=672) you use a proper input image, it will work much&nbsp; better than with the edge cases, but it is working&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pcIeAVQD0&t=678) pretty amazingly. While it is generating images,&nbsp; every generated image will be saved automatically&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pcIeAVQD0&t=685) after they have been generated. You don't have&nbsp; to wait for it to be completely finished to see&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pcIeAVQD0&t=690) them. Just open the "outputs" folder, and you will&nbsp; get them. And the model tends to add some breast&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pcIeAVQD0&t=696) tissue to the male character, so that is why it&nbsp; is important to generate multiple seeds. You see,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pcIeAVQD0&t=702) this one is not looking good, but this one&nbsp; is looking decent. So the quality that you&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pcIeAVQD0&t=706) are going to get totally depends on your input&nbsp; image pose and your clothing, and how well they&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pcIeAVQD0&t=713) are matching. If they are matching perfectly, then&nbsp; you will get very, very good, very, very accurate&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pcIeAVQD0&t=719) images, and it works pretty much with everything.&nbsp; You can add very custom images like this, and you&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pcIeAVQD0&t=725) can still get a very good result. "A red t-shirt",&nbsp; let's type it, and let's generate 10 more images.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pcIeAVQD0&t=731) You see, it didn't start with "Try on", so I put a&nbsp; dot here, and I undo and try on. So the key issues&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pcIeAVQD0&t=737) are your input image, the mask that you generate&nbsp; or the auto-generated mask, and how they are&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pcIeAVQD0&t=744) matching. And it is very powerful, and we got the&nbsp; results. Based on the pose of this input image,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pcIeAVQD0&t=750) this is the output. It is very, very good-looking,&nbsp; if you ask my opinion. So this is how you can fit&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pcIeAVQD0&t=756) this t-shirt onto this body pose. I hope you&nbsp; have enjoyed it. It is working even on virtual&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pcIeAVQD0&t=763) characters, anime characters, drawings. It is&nbsp; extremely flexible and powerful. Hopefully,&nbsp;&nbsp;
