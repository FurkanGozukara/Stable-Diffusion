### Video Transcription


- [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=0) [upbeat music] [Sundar Pichai speaking] If I were to look at the foundational breakthroughs

- [00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=3) in AI over the past decade, Google has been at the forefront of many of those breakthroughs.

- [00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=8) [voice of Demis Hassabis] Gemini is our largest and most capable model.

- [00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=11) It means that Gemini can understand the world around us in the way that we do.

- [00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=15) So not just text, but also code, audio, image and video.

- [00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=19) [voice of Sebastian Nowozin] Taylor used Gemini to search a large corpus of scientific papers

- [00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=23) for key information.

- [00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=24) [voice of Taylor Applebaum] We wrote a prompt.

- [00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=25) With its advanced reasoning capabilities, Gemini was able to distinguish between papers

- [00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=29) that were relevant to the study and those that weren't.

- [00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=31) [R√©mi Leblond speaking] I'm delighted to introduce AlphaCode2, powered by Gemini.

- [00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=36) When we evaluate AlphaCode2 on the same platform as the original AlphaCode, we solve almost

- [00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=42) twice as many problems.

- [00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=43) [voice of Gabriela Surita] Gemini on its own has the ability to transform software development

- [00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=48) as we understand it.

- [00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=49) [voice of Speaker 1] Based on their design, which of these would go faster?

- [00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=51) [voice of Gemini] The car on the right would be faster.

- [00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=55) It is more aerodynamic.

- [00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=56) [Lila Ibrahim speaking] But safety and responsibility has to be built in from the beginning, [James

- [00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=59) Manyika speaking] And that has oriented us to be both bold and responsible together.

- [00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=63) [voice of Demis Hassabis] Developers and enterprise customers are going to figure out really creative

- [00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=68) ways to further refine our foundational models.

- [00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=71) [Eli Collins speaking] Gemini will be available in three sizes.

- [00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=74) Gemini Ultra, our most capable and largest model for highly complex tasks; Gemini Pro,

- [00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=78) our best performing model for a broad range of tasks; and Gemini Nano, our most efficient

- [00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=82) model for on device tasks.

- [00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=83) [Demis Hassabis speaking] It's been a monumental engineering task, which has been very challenging,

- [00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=87) but also very exciting.

- [00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=89) [upbeat music ends] [Gabriela Surita speaking] We built Gemini from the ground up to be natively

- [00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=94) multimodal, including something quite important for both of us, programming code.

- [00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=99) Gemini is able to consistently understand, explain and generate code that is correct,

- [00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=104) and well-written in most programming languages.

- [00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=107) That includes Python, Java, C++ and Go.

- [00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=111) It substantially improves coding abilities over previous PaLM 2 models.

- [00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=116) From a benchmark of around 200 programming functions in Python it consistently solves

- [00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=120) about 75% of them in the first try, versus around 45% on PaLM 2.

- [00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=127) If you allow Gemini to check and repair its own answers, this number jumps to over 90%,

- [00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=132) which is a huge step forward.

- [00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=134) It can help you create and prototype new ideas in seconds.

- [00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=138) Let's give it a try.

- [00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=139) I really like trains, and if I wanted to create a train-spotting location web app, I can simply

- [00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=146) ask and get a working prototype in less than a minute.

- [00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=150) [light clicking] While the code isn't perfect, it's really helpful to have a first draft.

- [00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=155) Gemini, on its own, has the ability to transform software development as we understand it,

- [00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=161) but it can also be deployed as a key component of more sophisticated systems.

- [00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=165) [R√©mi Leblond speaking] Gemini is great at coding, but we've been able to take it even

- [00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=169) further, creating a specialized version that performs remarkably well at competitive programming.

- [00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=174) Now, why do we care about competitive programming?

- [00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=178) Well, it is one of the ultimate litmus tests of algorithmic coding abilities.

- [00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=183) So, you have thousands of talented programmers from all over the world that come together

- [00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=188) to compete and try to solve incredibly complex problems that require not only coding, but

- [00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=193) also math and reasoning.

- [00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=196) Two years ago, we presented AlphaCode, and it was the first AI system that could compete

- [00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=201) roughly at the level of the average human competitor.

- [00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=205) Today, I'm delighted to introduce AlphaCode2, a new and enhanced system with massively improved

- [00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=212) performance, powered by Gemini.

- [00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=216) When we evaluate AlphaCode2 on the same platform as the original AlphaCode, we solve almost

- [00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=222) twice as many problems.

- [00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=224) While AlphaCode broke through the top half of human competitors, on average, we estimate

- [00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=228) that AlphaCode2 performs better than 85% percent of competition participants.

- [00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=233) Let's have a look at our model in action on one of the hardest problems that we faced,

- [00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=239) and I say "hard" because in the original contest in which the problem appeared, less than 0.2%

- [00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=246) of participants actually solved it.

- [00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=249) The problem is quite difficult.

- [00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=250) It's very abstract, so I can't get into too many details, but the basic gist of it is

- [00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=256) that we are tasked with computing aggregate statistics that account for what appears to

- [00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=262) be an impossibly large amount of random arrays.

- [00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=265) The really cool thing is that to solve it, AlphaCode2 makes use of dynamic programming.

- [00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=271) Dynamic programming is an advanced algorithmic technique, which basically simplifies a complicated

- [00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=276) problem by breaking it down into easier sub-problems again and again, and what's really impressive

- [00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=282) is that not only AlphaCode2 knows how to properly implement this strategy, but also when and

- [00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=288) where to use it.

- [00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=290) What the example shows us is that competitive programming is not just about implementation,

- [00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=295) it's also about understanding, maths, computer science and indeed coding and that makes it

- [00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=301) an extremely hard reasoning task.

- [00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=304) So, it's not very surprising that up 'til now, generally available large language models

- [00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=310) have scored very poorly on this benchmark.

- [00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=313) These models are really, really good at following instructions, but AlphaCode needs to do more

- [00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=318) than that.

- [00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=319) It needs to show some level of understanding, some level of reasoning, designing of code

- [00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=324) solutions, before it can actually get to the actual implementation to solve the problem,

- [00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=330) and it does all that on problems that it's never seen before.

- [00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=334) Another thing that is great about AlphaCode is that it performs even better when it collaborates

- [00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=338) with human coders who can provide grounding.

- [00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=341) Basically, developers can specify properties that the code samples have to obey and when

- [00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=346) we do that, we see performance increase significantly.

- [00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=350) We think of this, this kind of interaction between programmers and AIs, as the future

- [00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=356) of programming, where coders will not just give instructions, but actually collaborate

- [00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=362) with highly capable AI models that can reason about their problems, that can propose code

- [00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=367) designs and that can even help with the actual implementation.

- [00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=370) AlphaCode2 was built for competitive programming, but we're already working on bringing some

- [00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=375) of its unique capabilities right into the general Gemini models, as a first step towards

- [00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=380) making this new programming paradigm available for everyone.

- [00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=385) [Sebastian Nowozin speaking] A common problem scientists face is a need to find and use

- [00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=393) data extracted from the scientific literature.

- [00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=396) This is difficult, because scientists need to search among thousands of scientific papers

- [00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=400) for key information and extract them by hand.

- [00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=403) It's a very common workflow and very time consuming.

- [00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=406) In fact, some of our scientists at Google DeepMind face this very problem.

- [00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=410) They use Gemini to help with it, because Gemini has an incredible understanding of science.

- [00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=414) Taylor will explain more.

- [00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=415) [Taylor Applebaum speaking] So, we were looking at this study from 2022.

- [00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=419) The authors had created a dataset by reviewing tens of thousands of scientific papers in

- [00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=423) genetics.

- [00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=424) They found a few hundred papers that contained the relevant information, extracted it by

- [00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=428) hand and collected it in a table.

- [00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=431) Studies like this can take a lot of time.

- [00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=433) We needed to update this dataset with what's new over the last couple of years, but that's

- [00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=437) over 200,000 new open access papers added to this domain since 2021.

- [00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=443) We couldn't do this manually, so we asked Gemini to help us out.

- [00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=446) First, we needed to filter for relevant scientific papers.

- [00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=450) We wrote a prompt just like this one, telling Gemini exactly what to look for.

- [00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=455) With its advanced reasoning capabilities, Gemini was able to distinguish between papers

- [00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=459) that were relevant to the study, and those that weren't.

- [00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=463) For the relevant papers, we wrote a similar prompt, asking Gemini to read the paper and

- [00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=468) extract the key data for us.

- [00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=469) [keyboard clicking] We could even ask Gemini to add annotations.

- [00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=472) This showed us exactly where in the paper Gemini found the information.

- [00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=477) We ran this at scale.

- [00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=478) And over a lunch break, Gemini read 200,000 papers for us, filtered it down to 250 and

- [00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=485) extracted their data.

- [00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=486) So, now we have a refreshed version of that dataset.

- [00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=490) But because Gemini is multimodal, not only can it reason about information from text,

- [00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=494) it can also reason about figures.

- [00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=496) So, let me show you something really neat.

- [00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=499) With our refreshed dataset, we can now ask Gemini to update a graph from the original

- [00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=503) study.

- [00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=504) We first gave Gemini a screenshot of this figure.

- [00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=507) Then, we asked it to generate the code required to plot it.

- [00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=511) And by feeding this code our new dataset, we get our updated figure.

- [00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=516) You can see that this figure now includes data up until 2023.

- [00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=520) [Sebastian Nowozin speaking] So, Taylor used Gemini to search a large corpus of literature

- [00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=525) for relevant papers and extract key information from these papers, as well as update figures.

- [00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=530) Of course, these capabilities can help more than just biologists or even scientists.

- [00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=535) They extend naturally to any domain that is reliant on large datasets, such as law or

- [00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=539) finance.

- [00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=540) So, that's what Gemini can make possible, and we are excited to see what you will create

- [00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=544) with Gemini.

- [00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=546) [Sam Cheung speaking] As a parent, you may have to help your kid with their homework.

- [00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=555) I've certainly had to.

- [00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=557) Here's where Gemini can help.

- [00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=559) For this demo, we've created a simple interface, and with some clever prompting under the hood,

- [00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=564) [switch toggle noise] we can really leverage Gemini's math, reasoning, and multi-modal

- [00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=568) capabilities to learn a subject like physics.

- [00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=570) [switch toggle noise] With Gemini, you can upload a photo of handwritten answers on a

- [00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=576) worksheet.

- [00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=577) Not only can Gemini solve these problems, but this is the amazing part.

- [00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=580) [mouse click] It can read the answers and understand what was right and what was wrong,

- [00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=585) and explain the concepts that need more clarification.

- [00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=588) So Gemini identified some mistakes with problems one and three here.

- [00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=593) Let's take a look at three.

- [00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=594) [mouse click] [light chime] Here, Gemini identifies that the formula was correct, but there was

- [00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=601) a mistake in calculating height.

- [00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=604) We can ask Gemini to explain in more details why the height is 50 meters instead of six.

- [00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=613) [keyboard clicking] I can ask Gemini to explain further.

- [00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=619) [keyboard clicking] Here, Gemini explains the step-by-step details to solving the problem.

- [00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=628) [light chime] Because of Gemini's ability to understand nuanced information and answer

- [00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=634) questions relating to complicated topics, it can give you a customized explanation of

- [00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=638) the subject you're trying to learn.

- [00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=640) And lastly, if you want to learn more, you can just ask.

- [00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=645) [keyboard clicking] Gemini will provide personalized practice problems based on mistakes.

- [00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=652) [light chime] Here I have a similar problem where I have to figure out the cat's speed

- [00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=657) when the height of the ramp is doubled.

- [00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=659) [mouse click] Oh yeah, I knew that.

- [00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=667) [Adri√† Recasens Continente speaking] Audio is a key form of communication in our daily

- [00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=674) life, from talking to a friend or listening to a song.

- [00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=678) Most of us lean on audio every day across many languages and for different purposes.

- [00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=683) Typically, when large language models interact with audio, they take the audio, they run

- [00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=688) it through a speech recognition system to convert it to text and then they fit that

- [00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=692) text into another model that understands text.

- [00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=695) However, by doing that, many nuances are lost, like voices or pronunciation, but Gemini,

- [00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=701) with its native multimodal capabilities is able to process the raw audio signal end to

- [00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=707) end.

- [00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=708) Let me take you through an example.

- [00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=709) We uploaded an audio clip that asked Gemini a question about pronunciation in a foreign

- [00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=714) language.

- [00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=715) Let's listen to the clip and then to Gemini's response.

- [00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=718) [keyboard clicking] [Speaker 1 speaking] How to pronounce the words "Lunar January" in

- [00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=726) Chinese.

- [00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=727) Option A, [speaking in Chinese].

- [00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=729) Option B, [speaking in Chinese].

- [00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=731) Which one is correct?

- [00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=732) Which tone is the correct tone for the first character?

- [00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=735) [Gemini speaking] Option A.

- [00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=739) The first character is pronounced with the first tone.

- [00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=742) [Adri√† Recasens Continente speaking] Gemini was able to differentiate the two ways of

- [00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=746) pronouncing the word to make sure it was correct.

- [00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=749) In that clip, there was only one speaker.

- [00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=751) Let's look at this example where there is more than one person speaking.

- [00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=755) [keyboard clicking] [Podcaster 1 speaking in French] [Podcaster 2 speaking in French]

- [00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=762) [Podcaster 2 speaking in French] [keyboard clicking] [speech activation sound] [Speaker

- [00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=769) 2 speaking] Hi, Gemini.

- [00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=772) I don't understand this podcast.

- [00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=774) Can you please summarize it for me in English?

- [00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=777) [speech deactivation sound] [Gemini speaking] The podcast is about the colors that are in

- [00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=783) fashion this season.

- [00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=785) The colors that are in fashion this season are canary yellow and scarlet red.

- [00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=789) The color that is not in fashion this season is night blue.

- [00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=792) [Adri√† Recasens Continente speaking] With Gemini multimodal capabilities, it can understand

- [00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=796) the conversation content, making it not only a transcription model, but a model that has

- [00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=801) much more nuanced understanding of the environment.

- [00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=804) Let's take it a bit further.

- [00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=806) Gemini works natively across vision, audio and text, meaning it can properly make sense

- [00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=811) of them together.

- [00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=813) Let's look at one final example.

- [00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=815) [keyboard clicking] [speech activation sound] [Speaker 3 speaking] What's the first step

- [00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=819) to make a veggie omelet with these ingredients?

- [00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=821) [speech deactivation sound] [keyboard clicking] [gentle chiming] [Gemini speaking] Crack the

- [00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=826) eggs into a bowl and whisk them.

- [00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=829) [keyboard clicking] [speech activation sound] [Speaker 3 speaking] Thank you for the instructions.

- [00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=836) I've started making my omelet.

- [00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=838) Does it look ready now?

- [00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=839) [speech deactivation sound] [keyboard clicking] [gentle chiming] [Gemini speaking] It looks

- [00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=844) like it's almost ready.

- [00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=845) You can flip it over to cook the other side.

- [00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=847) [keyboard clicking] [speech activation sound] [Speaker 3 speaking] Why is it it not ready?

- [00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=851) [speech deactivation sound] [Gemini speaking] It's not ready because the eggs are still

- [00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=856) runny.

- [00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=857) [keyboard clicking] [voice activation sound] [Speaker 3 speaking] What about now?

- [00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=862) [voice deactivation sound] [gentle chiming] [Gemini speaking] It looks ready now.

- [00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=869) You can take it off the heat and serve it.

- [00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=871) [Adri√† Recasens Continente speaking] As we saw, Gemini is able to simultaneously process

- [00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=876) information from three modalities, audio, vision and text.

- [00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=880) We believe that enabling Gemini to listen to the source audio will help us continue

- [00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=885) to expand its capabilities and make it more helpful to people.

- [00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=892) SPEAKER: Let's see if our multi-modal model Gemini can help make sense of my apartment.

- [00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=900) And to add a little extra challenge, I'm going to see if Gemini can handle being prompted

- [00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=904) only in Chinese.

- [00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=905) We'll start with this photo.

- [00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=907) Based on the lighting alone, I want to see if Gemini can figure out which direction my

- [00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=911) apartment faces.

- [00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=913) And Gemini responds.

- [00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=915) [SPEAKING CHINESE] OK.

- [00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=917) So it looks like Gemini says my room is South facing.

- [00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=922) So how about this plant?

- [00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=924) What type of light does it need?

- [00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=927) [SPEAKING CHINESE] So Gemini is saying this is a snake plant and it doesn't require a

- [00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=934) lot of sunlight.

- [00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=936) Awesome.

- [00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=937) So I've got a dining room that faces the opposite direction of my bedroom.

- [00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=941) I wonder if this plant would do better in there.

- [00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=944) Let me see.

- [00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=949) And Gemini responds.

- [00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=952) [SPEAKING CHINESE] So Gemini is surmising that my dining room faces North, it has lower

- [00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=959) light, and is therefore better suited for that plant.

- [00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=962) OK, that's some apartment planning with Gemini.

- [00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=966) Stay tuned for more.

- [00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=967) SPEAKER: Let's see if our multimodal model Gemini can find the similarities between images.

- [00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=972) We'll start with these two-- the Bosjes Chapel and this print by Hokusai.

- [00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=977) And I'll prompt Gemini, "Find a connection between these two images."

- [00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=982) Let's see what Gemini says.

- [00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=984) A curved and organic composition.

- [00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=987) The building is more refined, and the second image is more fluid.

- [00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=991) Yeah, that worked.

- [00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=993) OK, let's try another one using the moon and this golf ball on my webcam.

- [00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=998) And I'll run the same prompt.

- [00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1001) OK, let's see.

- [00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1003) "In 1971, the Apollo 14 crew hit two golf balls on the lunar surface."

- [00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1007) Wow, that's pretty good.

- [00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1009) OK, then one more just for fun.

- [00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1012) Who wore it better?

- [00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1014) The zebra.

- [00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1015) Oh, I like this.

- [00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1016) "The zebra has been wearing its stripes for millions of years."

- [00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1019) OK, there are some examples of visual understanding with Gemini.

- [00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1023) Stay tuned for more.

- [00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1028) [male voice] All right.

- [00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1045) Testing Gemini Here we go.

- [00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1047) Tell me what you see.

- [00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1048) [Gemini] I see you placing a piece of paper on the table.

- [00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1052) I see a squiggly line.

- [00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1054) [male voice] What about now?

- [00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1056) [Gemini] The contour lines are smooth and flowing with no sharp angles or jagged edges.

- [00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1063) It looks like a bird to me.

- [00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1065) [male voice] Hmm, what if I add this?

- [00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1067) [Gemini] The bird is swimming in the water.

- [00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1069) It has a long neck and beak.

- [00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1071) It is a duck.

- [00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1072) [male voice] Yes!

- [00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1073) [Gemini] A duck is a type of waterfowl in the family Anatidae.

- [00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1077) Ducks are closely related to geese and swans.

- [00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1079) The duck appears to be blue.

- [00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1081) This is not a common color for ducks.

- [00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1084) However, there are some breeds of blue ducks.

- [00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1086) These are typically not as common as other duck breeds.

- [00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1089) It is more common for ducks to be brown, black or white.

- [00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1092) [male voice] Are you sure?

- [00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1094) [Gemini] What the quack!

- [00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1095) I was just talking about a blue duck, and now you're holding one.

- [00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1099) It looks like blue ducks are more common than I thought.

- [00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1101) [male voice] Would this float?

- [00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1103) [Gemini] I'm not sure what material it's made of, but it looks like it might be rubber or

- [00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1108) plastic.

- [00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1109) [male voice] What if I tell you it's making a squeaking sound?

- [00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1110) [male voice] [toy squeaking] What if I tell you it's making a squeaking sound?

- [00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1112) [Gemini] Oh, if it's squeaking, it's definitely going to float.

- [00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1113) [male voice] Hmm nice.

- [00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1115) [Gemini] It is a rubber duck.

- [00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1116) It is made of a material that is less dense than water.

- [00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1119) [male voice] Can you teach me how to say this in a different language?

- [00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1122) And give me a few options.

- [00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1124) Ooh, can you explain how to pronounce the Mandarin one?

- [00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1127) Is it ‚ÄúyƒÅzi‚Äù? [voice of male speaking Mandarin] "YƒÅzi" [Gemini] ...is pronounced

- [00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1131) with a first tone.

- [00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1133) In Mandarin, there are four tones, which are essential to distinguish the meaning of words.

- [00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1137) The first tone is a high, level tone.

- [00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1139) [male voice] Ooh, ok.

- [00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1142) [Gemini] The duck is in the middle of the ocean.

- [00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1144) There is no land nearby for the duck to rest or find food.

- [00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1148) It is unlikely to find ducks here naturally.

- [00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1150) [male voice] Okay, based on what you see, come up with a game idea.

- [00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1154) Oh, and use Emojis please.

- [00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1156) [Gemini] How about this?

- [00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1157) We can play a game called ‚ÄúGuess the Country.‚Äù

- [00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1160) [male voice] Sure, let‚Äôs do it!

- [00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1161) [Gemini] Clue 1 This country is the home of the kangaroo, the koala, and the Great Barrier

- [00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1166) Reef.

- [00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1167) [male voice] Oh, that‚Äôs easy.

- [00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1169) [chime] [Gemini] Clue 2 This country loves football and has won the most Men's World

- [00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1173) Cups in football history.

- [00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1175) [male voice] Hmm.

- [00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1177) [chime] [Gemini] You are trying to get me to find the paper ball under the cup.

- [00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1183) I accept the challenge.

- [00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1188) The cup to the left.

- [00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1190) [male voice] Nice!

- [00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1193) [Gemini] I know what you're doing.

- [00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1197) You're playing Rock, Paper, Scissors.

- [00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1199) [male voice] What do you see now?

- [00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1201) [Gemini] The fingers are spread out to look like the wings of a butterfly.

- [00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1204) [male voice] What‚Äôs this?

- [00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1206) [Gemini] Big ear and barking mouth.

- [00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1208) A dog.

- [00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1210) [male voice] Sweet!

- [00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1212) [Gemini] The coin should be under the right hand.

- [00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1215) [male voice] Mmh.

- [00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1216) I don‚Äôt know...

- [00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1217) [Gemini] The coin is in the left hand, using a sleight of hand technique to make it appear

- [00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1221) as if the coin has disappeared.

- [00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1226) Both objects are round and flat.

- [00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1228) [male voice] There you go!

- [00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1230) [Gemini] Both are food.

- [00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1231) The orange is a healthier choice than the cookie.

- [00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1235) Citrus can be calming and so can the spin of the fidget toy.

- [00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1240) They are both examples of popular toys that have been enjoyed by children and adults alike

- [00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1245) for many years.

- [00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1246) [male voice] Give me some ideas for what I can make with this.

- [00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1250) [Gemini] I see pink and green yarn.

- [00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1252) How about a dragon fruit?

- [00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1255) Or how about a green cake with a pink heart?

- [00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1257) [male voice] OK, how about these colors?

- [00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1260) And maybe show me some animals.

- [00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1262) [Gemini] OK, now I see blue and pink yarn.

- [00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1265) How about a pig with blue ears?

- [00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1267) Or an octopus?

- [00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1269) Or a bunny with a pink nose?

- [00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1271) [male voice] Oooh, I'll keep those in mind.

- [00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1275) Which way should the duck go?

- [00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1276) [Gemini] Going left leads to a duck, which is a friend.

- [00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1280) Going right leads to a bear, which is a foe.

- [00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1282) It is better to make friends than foes, so the duck should go left.

- [00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1286) [male voice] Smart choice.

- [00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1288) [Gemini] This is a picture of a crab.

- [00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1291) [male voice] That's right.

- [00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1295) Is this the right order?

- [00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1296) [Gemini] No, the correct order is Sun, Earth, Saturn.

- [00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1301) [male voice] Based on their design, which of these would go faster?

- [00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1306) [Gemini] The car on the right would be faster.

- [00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1308) It is more aerodynamic.

- [00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1310) [male voice] Which looks more fun?

- [00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1313) [Gemini] The one on the right, because it has a loop.

- [00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1315) [male voice] What do you think this person might be saying?

- [00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1317) [Gemini] How about a "Woohoo!"

- [00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1319) [male voice] Oooh, I love that.

- [00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1324) [Gemini] I see you're drawing a guitar.

- [00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1326) [acoustic guitar music] You've added an amp.

- [00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1333) Now it's an electric guitar.

- [00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1335) We can make some seriously loud music now.

- [00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1338) [electric guitar] Given that you added drums, how about some 80's hair metal?

- [00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1345) [rock music plays] Alright, I see you've added a palm tree to the drawing.

- [00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1350) Change it up with some beachy vibes.

- [00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1352) [ukelele music plays] [male voice] What movie are they acting out here?

- [00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1358) [Gemini] I think they are acting out the famous bullet time scene from The Matrix.

- [00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1362) [male voice] Ohhh, nice!

- [00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1365) What do you think might happen next?

- [00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1367) [Gemini] The cat is going to jump to the wall and stick the landing.

- [00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1370) It's going to be a purrfect 10.

- [00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1373) Oh, and it's a miss.

- [00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1375) It looks like it was just a little too far away.

- [00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1378) But don't worry.

- [00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1379) The cat is a natural athlete and it will be back up there in no time.

- [00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1382) [male voice] OK, I've got one more for you.

- [00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1385) Describe the drawing I made.

- [00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1387) [Gemini] It is a simple line drawing of the constellation Gemini.

- [00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1391) You did a good job of capturing the beauty of Gemini.

- [00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1394) [male voice] Nice!

- [00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1395) That's it.

- [00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1397) [male voice, muffled and faint] I think we're done.

- [00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1409) Let's see if our multimodal model&nbsp; Gemini can guess some movies.

- [00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1412) All right we're going to start here.

- [00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1415) Given the play on words and these&nbsp; images, guess the name of the movie.

- [00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1420) [Gemini] The Breakfast Club.

- [00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1423) All right what about this?

- [00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1425) [Gemini] Breakfast at Tiffany's.

- [00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1428) All right.

- [00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1430) What about this?

- [00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1431) Uncut Gems.

- [00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1432) Cool, cool, cool.

- [00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1434) So these are working!

- [00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1435) Here's a couple more quick tests I ran it through.

- [00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1440) Goldfinger.

- [00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1441) Nice!

- [00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1442) Bottle Rocket.

- [00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1443) Okay.

- [00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1444) The Wizard of Oz.

- [00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1446) Nice, nice.

- [00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1448) Moonrise Kingdom.

- [00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1449) Okay, this last one's a little more complicated.

- [00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1453) Forest Gump.

- [00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1454) Okay wow, I honestly didn't&nbsp; think it was going to get that.

- [00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1458) And that's an experiment in&nbsp; guessing movies with Gemini Stay tuned for more.

- [00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1463) Thank you.

- [00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1465) Let's see if our multimodal model Gemini can turn images into code.

- [00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1469) I'll start with this image of a tree and just select the part I want and then ask Gemini,

- [00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1474) can you turn this image into an SVG?

- [00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1481) This represents the main shapes of a tree.

- [00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1483) Let's see.

- [00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1485) That's pretty good.

- [00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1486) Alright, now I want to try a more difficult test.

- [00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1490) Let's see if Gemini can make an interactive demo in JavaScript.

- [00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1495) Okay, here we go.

- [00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1499) A common algorithm for this is called a fractal tree.

- [00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1503) Okay, this is pretty cool.

- [00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1506) Gemini even provided a slider so I can change and move the fractals.

- [00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1510) It even provided me with the actual code.

- [00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1515) Nice.

- [00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1516) And there you have it.

- [00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1517) Stay tuned for more coding experiments coming soon.

- [00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1520) Thanks.

- [00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1521) SPEAKER 1: For this test, let's see if our multimodal model Gemini can understand how

- [00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1527) some unusual images were created using emojis from Emoji Kitchen.

- [00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1532) Emoji Kitchen lets you combine different emoji to make new ones.

- [00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1536) For example, if you combine this ghost with this avocado, you get this.

- [00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1542) We'll see if it can guess this one.

- [00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1546) SPEAKER 2: I think it's ghost and avocado.

- [00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1550) SPEAKER 1: Nice.

- [00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1551) Now let's see if it can explain the visual details it used.

- [00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1555) SPEAKER 2: The emoji has the shape of a ghost, but it is green and has a big, brown pit.

- [00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1560) SPEAKER 1: Now let's give it a name and a short tagline.

- [00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1564) SPEAKER 2: Avogeist.

- [00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1566) The ghost of guacamole.

- [00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1567) SPEAKER 1: That's a good one.

- [00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1569) Here's a couple more tests I ran.

- [00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1570) SPEAKER 2: I'd call this one Party Ghost.

- [00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1573) Boo-gie on down.

- [00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1576) I'd call this one RoboBunny.

- [00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1579) Part robot, all ears.

- [00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1582) I'd call this one Mushy.

- [00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1583) Feeling emotional?

- [00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1585) SPEAKER 1: And there you have it.

- [00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1587) Learn more about Gemini, and stay tuned for more tests.

- [00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1592) Let's see if our multimodal model,&nbsp; Gemini, can understand outfits.

- [00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1594) We'll start with something&nbsp; simple, like this puffer.

- [00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1598) And ask, what is someone&nbsp; wearing this best dress to do?

- [00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1603) Hmm.

- [00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1605) Perfect for staying warm in the tundra...

- [00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1606) Good color for blending in with glacial ice.

- [00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1609) Okay, how about another one?

- [00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1613) Intergalactic travel.

- [00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1615) Okay.

- [00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1616) How about this one?

- [00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1618) To boldly go where no one has&nbsp; gone before...and place Jazz.

- [00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1622) All right.

- [00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1623) Gemini's got jokes.

- [00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1624) Now, coin a term for that outfit.

- [00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1627) Moon core.

- [00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1628) That's actually pretty good.

- [00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1630) Okay, well that's understanding&nbsp; my outfit with Gemini.

- [00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1633) Stay tuned for more visual tests soon.

- [00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1635) Thanks [gentle music] [James Manyika speaking] I am so excited about Gemini because it's

- [00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1641) probably the most capable AI system we've ever developed.

- [00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1644) [Lila Ibrahim speaking] But safety and responsibility has to be built in from the beginning and

- [00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1647) at Google DeepMind, that's what we've done with Gemini.

- [00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1650) [James Manyika speaking] As these systems become more capable, especially the multimodality,

- [00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1656) images, audio, video, all of those capabilities also raise new questions.

- [00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1660) [Tulsee Doshi speaking] Going from image to text, that introduces new contextual challenges

- [00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1664) because an image might be innocuous on its own, or text might be innocuous on its own,

- [00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1669) but the combination could be offensive or hurtful.

- [00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1674) We develop proactive policies and adapt those to the unique considerations of multimodal

- [00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1679) capabilities, and that allows us to test for new risks like cybersecurity and considerations

- [00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1684) like bias and toxicity.

- [00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1686) [Dawn Bloxwich speaking] One of the key areas is not only internal evaluations, but also

- [00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1692) external evaluations.

- [00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1694) This can look like external red teaming to bring in different experts to give us their

- [00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1697) perspectives on how the model is performing, but it also involves getting their advice.

- [00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1702) [Tulsee Doshi speaking] So we're working with organizations like MLCommons to develop extensive

- [00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1706) benchmarks that we can use both to test models within Google and across the industry.

- [00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1711) And we're also creating cross-industry collaborations via frameworks like SAIF, the Secure AI Framework.

- [00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1717) [James Manyika speaking] It's an incredible way to learn from the industry, learn from

- [00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1720) other experts and build that into how we're approaching responsibility at Google.

- [00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1724) [Dawn Bloxwich speaking] It can mean that our models, our products are better for people

- [00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1729) and better for society overall.

- [00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1731) [gentle music fades] [Palash Nandy speaking] Here you will see a demo of Gemini's multimodal

- [00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1738) reasoning capabilities to understand and reason about user's intent, use tools and generate

- [00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1744) bespoke user experiences that go beyond chat interfaces.

- [00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1749) Let's say I'm looking for inspirations for a birthday party theme for my daughter.

- [00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1753) [keyboard clicking] Gemini says, "I can help you with that.

- [00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1756) Could you tell me what she's interested in?"

- [00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1759) So I say, sure.

- [00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1760) She loves animals, and we are thinking about doing something outdoors.

- [00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1764) At this point, instead of responding in text, Gemini goes and creates [bells chime] a bespoke

- [00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1768) interface to help me explore ideas.

- [00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1770) It's got lots of ideas.

- [00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1772) It's visually rich.

- [00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1773) It's interactable.

- [00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1775) Now, none of this was coded up.

- [00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1777) It was all generated by Gemini.

- [00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1779) Gemini uses a series of reasoning steps going from broad decisions to increasingly high

- [00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1784) resolution of reasoning, finally, getting to code and data.

- [00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1788) First, Gemini considers, "Does it even need a UI?

- [00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1792) Is a text prompt best?

- [00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1794) Okay, this is a complex request that needs lots of information to be presented in an

- [00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1798) organized way."

- [00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1801) Gemini then tries to understand if it knows enough to help.

- [00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1803) There is a lot of ambiguity.

- [00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1805) I didn't say what my daughter's interests are or what kind of a party I wanted, so it

- [00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1810) had asked a clarifying question.

- [00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1812) When I said we are thinking about an outdoor party and my daughter loves animals, Gemini

- [00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1817) reasoned it had enough information to proceed, but it made a note that there was still ambiguity

- [00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1821) about what kind of animals.

- [00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1823) And this is important, "And what kind of outdoor party?"

- [00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1826) Next is a critical step.

- [00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1828) Gemini writes the product requirement document, or PRD.

- [00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1831) It contains the plan for the kinds of functionality the experience will have.

- [00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1835) For instance, it should show different possible party themes, some activities and food options

- [00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1841) for them.

- [00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1842) Now, based on this PRD, Gemini tries to design the best experience for the user's journey.

- [00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1847) It thinks that the user will like to explore a list of options but will also want to delve

- [00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1852) into details.

- [00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1853) It uses this to design a list and detailed layout that we saw earlier.

- [00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1858) With this design, it writes the Flutter code to compose the interface out of widgets and

- [00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1863) write any functionality needed.

- [00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1865) Finally, it generates and retrieves the data needed to render the experience.

- [00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1870) You can see it filling in content and images for the different sections.

- [00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1874) Ah, farm animals.

- [00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1876) She would like that.

- [00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1877) [pop up sound] Clicking on the interface regenerates the data to be rendered by the code it wrote.

- [00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1882) Ooh, I know she likes cupcakes.

- [00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1884) I can now click on anything in the interface and ask it for more information.

- [00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1889) I could say, [keyboard clicking] step-by-step instructions on how to bake this, and it starts

- [00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1894) to generate a new UI.

- [00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1896) This time it designs a UI [bells chime] best suited for giving me step-by-step instructions.

- [00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1902) I wanna find some suitable cake toppers for this.

- [00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1904) [keyboard clicking] Show me some farm animal cake toppers.

- [00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1909) At this point, Gemini again decides to create a visually rich experience.

- [00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1912) [bells chime] It generates a gallery of images.

- [00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1915) Notice the drop-downs at the top.

- [00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1917) It decided that maybe it should help me explore by showing different options.

- [00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1921) A sheep sounds interesting.

- [00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1923) I know she likes that.

- [00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1924) [bells chime] And now it helps me pick sheep cake toppers.

- [00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1928) These look great.

- [00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1929) This is going to be a fun birthday party.

- [00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1931) I hope you saw a glimpse of what Gemini is capable of.

- [00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1934) I'm really excited about what's possible here.

- [00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1937) This is such an interesting time in AI, and I'm excited to be part of this.

- [00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1941) [soft music begins] [Sundar Pichai speaking] You know, one of the reasons we got interested

- [00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1951) in AI from the very beginning is that we always viewed our mission as a timeless mission.

- [00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1957) It's to organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful.

- [00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1962) But as information has grown in scale and complexity, you know, the problem has gotten

- [00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1969) harder.

- [00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1970) So we always knew we needed to have a deeper breakthrough to make progress.

- [00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1974) [upbeat music begins] [voice of Demis Hassabis] I've worked on AI my whole life because I've

- [00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1979) always felt it would be the most beneficial and consequential technology for humanity.

- [00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1985) Human beings in our society, we have five senses, and the world we built, and the media

- [00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1990) we consume is in those different modalities.

- [00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1993) So, I'm super proud and excited to announce the launch of the Gemini era, a first step

- [00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=1998) towards a truly universal AI model.

- [00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=2000) [Jeff Dean speaking] The Gemini approach to multimodality is all the kinds of things you

- [00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=2004) want an artificial intelligence system to be able to do, and these are capabilities

- [00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=2009) that haven't really existed in computers before.

- [00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=2012) [Oriol Vinyals speaking] Traditionally, multimodal models are created by stitching together text-only,

- [00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=2018) vision-only, and audio-only models in a suboptimal way at a secondary stage.

- [00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=2024) Gemini is multimodal from the ground up, so it can seamlessly have a conversation across

- [00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=2030) modalities and give you the best possible response.

- [00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=2032) [voice of Demis Hassabis] Gemini is our largest and most capable model, it means that Gemini

- [00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=2037) can understand the world around us in the way that we do and absorb any type of input

- [00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=2043) and output, so not just text like most models, but also code, audio, image and video.

- [00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=2051) What's amazing about Gemini is that it's so good at so many things.

- [00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=2054) As we started getting to the end of the training, we started seeing that Gemini was better than

- [00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=2059) any other model out there on these very, very important benchmarks.

- [00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=2062) For example, each of the 50 different subject areas that we tested on, it's as good as the

- [00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=2067) best expert humans in those areas.

- [00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=2069) [Sundar Pichai speaking] It's very rare that you can work on a technology at a foundational

- [00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=2074) level, and it simultaneously can impact all our products.

- [00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=2078) [Oriol Vinyals speaking] We created a family of models that can run on everything from

- [00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=2082) mobile devices to data centers, each of which is actually best in class.

- [00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=2087) [Eli Collins speaking] Gemini will be available in three sizes.

- [00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=2089) Gemini Ultra, our most capable and largest model for highly complex tasks; Gemini Pro,

- [00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=2094) our best performing model for a broad range of tasks; and Gemini Nano, our most efficient

- [00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=2098) model for on-device tasks.

- [00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=2099) [Demis Hassabis speaking] We want to provide the best foundational building blocks, and

- [00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=2104) then we know developers and enterprise customers are going to figure out really creative ways

- [00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=2111) to further refine our Gemini foundational models, and the potential's almost limitless.

- [00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=2116) [voice Of James Manyika] So at Google, there's this healthy disregard for the impossible,

- [00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=2122) and that has oriented us to be both bold and responsible together.

- [00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=2127) As these systems become more capable, all of those capabilities also raise new questions.

- [00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=2131) [Tulsee Doshi speaking] We have to think about what it means to have an image, be a part

- [00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=2134) of, for example, the input.

- [00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=2136) Because an image might be innocuous on its own, or text might be innocuous on its own,

- [00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=2141) but the combination could be offensive or hurtful.

- [00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=2143) [Lila Ibrahim speaking] Safety and responsibility has to be built-in from the beginning.

- [00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=2146) And at Google DeepMind, that's what we've done with Gemini.

- [00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=2149) [voice of Tulsee Doshi] We develop proactive policies and adapt those to the unique considerations

- [00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=2154) of multimodal capabilities; we then do rigorous testing against those policies to prevent

- [00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=2159) the harms that we've identified with approaches like classifiers and filters.

- [00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=2162) [voice of Sundar Pichai] If I were to look at the foundational breakthroughs in AI over

- [00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=2166) the past decade, Google has been at the forefront of many of those breakthroughs, and I think

- [00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=2172) Gemini continues that rich tradition.

- [00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=2174) [voice of Demis Hassabis] It's been an enormous sort of monumental engineering task, which

- [00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=2178) has been, you know, very challenging, but also very exciting.

- [00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=2181) [Jeff Dean speaking] I have been at Google for quite a while and the reason I'm here

- [00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=2185) is really, I believe in the company's mission, and I think Gemini is a great step in that

- [00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=2189) overall mission.

- [00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=2190) [Oriol Vinyals speaking] We end up with a world that has more knowledge and that people

- [00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=2194) have more access to information that otherwise would not be available to them.

- [00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=2198) [voice of Sundar Pichai] That's what excites me, the chance to make AI helpful for everyone,

- [00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=2204) everywhere in the world.

- [00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=2206) [music becomes more upbeat] [Mark Rober speaking] We're about to test the accuracy of this plane

- [00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=2226) I built with Bard, and then we're gonna send it through that ring of fire.

- [00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=2232) [upbeat music begins] When Google asked me to try out the latest version of Bard, [upbeat

- [00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=2243) music fades out] I had an idea.

- [00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=2244) I wanted to know if the advanced reasoning and multi-modal capabilities in the latest

- [00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=2248) version of Bard could master a very specific brand [people shouting] of slightly chaotic,

- [00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=2253) educational science content.

- [00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=2254) [toy gun firing] In short, could Bard create a better Mark Rober video than me, Mark Rober?

- [00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=2259) [bell chimes] [lofi music begins] Okay, I'm gonna ask Bard for an idea, but first we need

- [00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=2264) to calibrate this thing's accuracy.

- [00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=2266) [keyboard clicking] Who is the most handsome science YouTuber?

- [00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=2270) Come on, Bard.

- [00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=2272) [Voice Of Bard] Mark Rober: American YouTuber, engineer, - inventor and educator.

- [00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=2276) - I'm blushing [Mark Rober speaking] Bard, this is like, oh my gosh.

- [00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=2280) Okay, down to business.

- [00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=2282) Some ideas for a [keyboard clicking] Mark Rober video?

- [00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=2286) [voice of Bard] Feats of engineering: The world's fastest [sound of ball being hit]

- [00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=2291) Pickleball racket.

- [00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=2292) [sound of balloon inflating] The world's largest balloon pop and the most indestructible [detonation

- [00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=2295) noise] gingerbread house ever.

- [00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=2296) [explosion sound] [no signal, TV sound] [lofi music fades out] [Mark Rober speaking] And

- [00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=2298) so after a long back and forth with Bard, it landed on, no pun intended, making the

- [00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=2303) world's most accurate paper airplane.

- [00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=2305) Now I've been wanting to do a paper airplane video on my channel for a while, so getting

- [00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=2310) Bard to just do it for me seems like a win-win.

- [00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=2313) But an idea is nothing without a good story.

- [00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=2316) So I asked Bard for the story structure in a typical Mark Rober video.

- [00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=2320) First step, design.

- [00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=2321) [spray paint hiss] [upbeat drum music begins] [voice of Bard] Exploring paper airplane designs.

- [00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=2325) Start by delving into classic airplane designs.

- [00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=2329) Paper airplane design is an artful blend of creativity [paper cutting sound] and scientific

- [00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=2332) principles.

- [00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=2333) [voice of Mark Rober] From the options, I tried the Glider, the Concorde and the rather

- [00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=2336) unusually named Canard.

- [00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=2338) On to step two.

- [00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=2339) [voice of Bard] Defining accuracy.

- [00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=2341) [voice of Mark Rober] Bard and I talked about accuracy, wing configuration and how to test

- [00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=2346) the accuracy of the three designs.

- [00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=2349) [voice of Bard] Target practice, [plastic cups falling] hoop shots, obstacle courses

- [00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=2353) and the [dart hitting board] dart board challenge.

- [00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=2355) [voice of Mark Rober] It was the Glider versus the Concorde versus the Canard.

- [00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=2359) Which of these will be the most accurate and why?

- [00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=2364) [voice of Bard] The Concorde paper airplane is likely to be [Mark laughs] the most accurate.

- [00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=2368) [Mark Rober speaking] I hit the cameraman.

- [00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=2370) I'm so sorry.

- [00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=2371) [Mark Laughs] [voice of Bard] The glider and [Mark groans] Canard designs also have potential

- [00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=2376) for good - flight performance, - Oh man.

- [00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=2378) but they may not be as efficient as the Concorde.

- [00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=2380) [Mark victoriously shouting] [Mark Rober speaking] That is a fine example of Aerogami.

- [00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=2385) And yes, Bard taught me that word.

- [00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=2388) Bard called it.

- [00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=2389) It looks like the Concorde was the closest.

- [00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=2392) I wouldn't have guessed that.

- [00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=2393) I would've thought Canard.

- [00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=2394) But you know what?

- [00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=2395) [spray paint hissing] Now that we had our winning design, it was time to take the next

- [00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=2398) step.

- [00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=2399) [voice of Bard] Optimizing the design.

- [00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=2401) Sure, I can critique the design of your paper airplane.

- [00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=2403) [voice of Mark Rober] Okay, so it's saying the wings are too small, the tail is too small,

- [00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=2407) the paper's too light and that I should use foam board instead.

- [00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=2410) [music fades out] [voice of Bard] You need to make it bigger.

- [00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=2412) [voice of Mark Rober] Okay.

- [00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=2414) Wow.

- [00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=2415) Bard is challenging me, [sound of toy firing] Mark Rober, [excited crowd shouting] to make

- [00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=2417) something bigger?

- [00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=2419) It's time to call in the reinforcements.

- [00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=2421) [lofi music begins] [voice of Bard] Make the wings larger, make the tail larger, make the

- [00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=2424) folds sharper.

- [00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=2425) By following these steps, you can improve the stability and control of your airplane.

- [00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=2430) [people laughing] [Mark Rober speaking] And now for the final step.

- [00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=2435) [voice of Bard] The ultimate accuracy test.

- [00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=2438) [Mark Rober speaking] I asked what a visually appealing and engaging test environment would

- [00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=2443) look like for a Mark Rober experiment, creating the world's most accurate airplane.

- [00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=2447) "Mark could use-" [voice of Bard] cones to mark the flight.

- [00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=2451) Use a fog machine to create a dramatic effect, sparklers to add a touch of... sparkle.

- [00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=2456) Use small fireworks- [Mark Rober speaking] "to create a grand finale."

- [00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=2458) [lofi music ends] Bard is bringing the drama.

- [00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=2460) I love it.

- [00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=2461) But then I asked Bard to come up with just one more twist.

- [00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=2464) [upbeat music fades in] What's the most extreme and eye-catching way to test the accuracy

- [00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=2469) and stability of my airplane for a YouTube video?

- [00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=2472) [voice of Bard] Throw it through a ring of fire.

- [00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=2474) [Mark Rober speaking] Challenge accepted.

- [00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=2476) [upbeat music] [metal grinding] [Mark shouting] [plane launching] [Mark laughing] 'Tis but

- [00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=2492) a minor scratch.

- [00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=2496) Oh boy, I have terrible news.

- [00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=2500) Bard, I've got like a six-foot plane here and I'm trying to fly it through a ring of

- [00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=2505) fire and it kind of stalled out.

- [00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=2509) Do you think it's true that a localized pocket of hot air would lead to lower air pressure

- [00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=2515) that would cause my plane to stall?

- [00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=2518) "Yes, it is true that a localized pocket of hot air could lead to lower air pressure,

- [00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=2523) which could cause your plane to stall.

- [00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=2527) Hot air is less dense than cold air."

- [00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=2528) That actually makes sense.

- [00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=2529) So it rises.

- [00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=2530) "This rising air creates a region of low pressure below it."

- [00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=2534) That's like exactly what happened there.

- [00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=2536) I think this actually helps.

- [00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=2538) Keep our pressure at max, and then we're just gonna like dart right into it, as opposed

- [00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=2542) to like a high stall out.

- [00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=2544) - Here we go.

- [00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=2545) One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

- [00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=2550) Full power, baby.

- [00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=2552) 1300, let's go!

- [00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=2553) Three, two, one, hit it!

- [00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=2556) Oh, that's the one!

- [00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=2557) That's it!

- [00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=2558) That's it!

- [00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=2559) That's it!

- [00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=2560) Yeah!

- [00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=2561) Through the ring!

- [00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=2562) Normally it takes like a year for me to go from idea to a final build like this.

- [00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=2567) This only took us three weeks thanks to Bard.

- [00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=2571) Massive time saver for every step of the process.

- [00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=2575) Incredible creative collaborator right in your pocket.

- [00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=2577) Okay, time to wrap this up.

- [00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=2579) Actually, let's do it this way.

- [00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=2581) [keyboard clicking] What's a good outro for a Mark Rober video?

- [00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=2584) "Subscribe for more science experiments and explosions.

- [00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=2588) I'm Mark Rober and I approve this message."

- [00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=2591) If you enjoy this video, please give it a thumbs up and a fire extinguisher.

- [00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1s7ndtDXSk&t=2594) [upbeat music fades out]
