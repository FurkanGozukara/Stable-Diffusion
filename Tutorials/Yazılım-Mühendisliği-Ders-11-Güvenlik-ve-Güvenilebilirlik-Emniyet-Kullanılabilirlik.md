### Video Transcription


- [00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=3) Hello everyone, welcome to our Software Engineering 11th course.

- [00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=5) welcome to our Software Engineering 11th course. The topic of today's course is security and

- [00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=8) The topic of today's course is security and reliability. Before we begin,

- [00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=11) reliability. Before we begin,

- [00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=20) I want to comment on the concepts of security and reliability. These concepts get quite confusing when translated from English. There was Seyfi, there was an

- [00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=25) concepts get quite confusing when translated from English. There was Seyfi, there was an Efendi ticket, there was reliability, there

- [00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=28) Efendi ticket, there was reliability, there was security. All of these can be translated into Turkish

- [00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=32) was security. All of these can be translated into Turkish as security or safety.

- [00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=34) as security or safety. That's why there's a bit of conceptual

- [00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=38) That's why there's a bit of conceptual confusion. Actually,

- [00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=42) confusion. Actually,

- [00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=46) if you know English, it might be better to read the original version of Slime. The topics covered in our section are

- [00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=50) might be better to read the original version of Slime. The topics covered in our section are reliability features.

- [00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=52) reliability features. Here, what we

- [00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=53) Here, what we call depende was never dependable. So,

- [00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=56) call depende was never dependable. So, if something is dependable, you

- [00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=58) if something is dependable, you can trust it

- [00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=60) can trust it and live on it. We have

- [00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=64) and live on it. We have a reliability in that sense.

- [00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=67) a reliability in that sense. System features that lead to revenue.

- [00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=69) System features that lead to revenue. Usability and reliability.

- [00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=71) Usability and reliability.

- [00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=75) Systems must be in place to provide services and operate as expected. So, if you trust a system, the

- [00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=79) So, if you trust a system, the system

- [00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=81) system must meet your expectations. It must be always online, it

- [00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=83) must meet your expectations. It must be always online, it must not fail, it

- [00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=85) must not fail, it must not crash. Security

- [00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=88) must not crash. Security systems must behave in an unsafe manner.

- [00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=90) systems must behave in an unsafe manner. So, your mother opened a medical

- [00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=95) So, your mother opened a medical device, an MRI device, or an X

- [00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=100) device, an MRI device, or an X device. These devices are expected to

- [00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=103) device. These devices are expected to operate in a way that does not harm human health.

- [00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=105) operate in a way that does not harm human health. And

- [00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=107) And a security system like an elderly insulin pump device and themselves. It

- [00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=111) a security system like an elderly insulin pump device and themselves. It should be protected from external interference,

- [00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=113) should be protected from external interference, so for example, we hear all the time about

- [00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=117) so for example, we hear all the time about data leakage. For example,

- [00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=120) data leakage. For example, here's the issue. For example, the

- [00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=123) here's the issue. For example, the passwords of many people's email addresses were stolen,

- [00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=125) passwords of many people's email addresses were stolen, like the passwords of many people were published online.

- [00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=129) like the passwords of many people were published online. Or, they're stealing your credit card

- [00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=131) Or, they're stealing your credit card information from

- [00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=133) information from Biran e-commerce site where your mother shops. They're

- [00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=134) Biran e-commerce site where your mother shops. They're

- [00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=140) making purchases without your knowledge. My mother probably

- [00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=143) My mother probably made a purchase before. The database of the e-commerce

- [00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=145) made a purchase before. The database of the e-commerce site was added, and

- [00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=148) site was added, and they made purchases with the information they obtained.

- [00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=150) they made purchases with the information they obtained. Of course, I had to cancel them all one by one.

- [00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=153) Of course, I had to cancel them all one by one. But systems must be secure.

- [00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=156) But systems must be secure. Yes, system reliability is the

- [00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=160) Yes, system reliability is the most important system feature for many computer-based systems.

- [00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=162) most important system feature for many computer-based systems. A reliable system

- [00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=166) A reliable system

- [00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=170) reflects the user's level of trust in that system. It will work as expected,

- [00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=173) It will work as expected, and

- [00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=174) and they won't be successful in normal use. The user's level of trust

- [00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=175) they won't be successful in normal use. The user's level of trust

- [00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=180) reflects the level of trust in the system. That day, reliability

- [00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=182) That day, reliability can be used, and security encompasses related system features such as security.

- [00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=184) can be used, and security encompasses related system features such as security. So,

- [00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=187) So,

- [00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=195) here's what it can do for a year. Faced municipality. Security, like here, is someone from the Gentleman. So, you see, translating such concepts

- [00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=197) you see, translating such concepts

- [00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=201) from English is a bit difficult for me. Now we'll manage. Does reliability matter? System

- [00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=204) reliability matter? System failures can have

- [00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=206) failures can have widespread effects on many people affected by the failure.

- [00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=208) widespread effects on many people affected by the failure. So, if there's a failure in the system,

- [00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=211) So, if there's a failure in the system, many people affected by the system failure can

- [00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=213) many people affected by the system failure can come and go, administrators,

- [00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=216) come and go, administrators, and naturally, they can send their credit card

- [00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=219) and naturally, they can send their credit card information. Like millions of people being stolen,

- [00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=221) information. Like millions of people being stolen, like home addresses being leaked, like

- [00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=225) like home addresses being leaked, like cell phone numbers being exposed,

- [00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=227) cell phone numbers being exposed, like unreliable,

- [00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=229) like unreliable, unreliable, or security systems. Look, we've

- [00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=232) unreliable, or security systems. Look, we've translated this here, we have a mistake. Let

- [00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=236) translated this here, we have a mistake. Let me translate it into English, let's fix this.

- [00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=240) me translate it into English, let's fix this. Yes, yes, look, you're stuck with the system. Hewai

- [00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=249) Yes, yes, look, you're stuck with the system. Hewai trappex with a large number of people.

- [00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=257) trappex with a large number of people. Yes, you know, we're leaving.

- [00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=264) Yes, you know, we're leaving. Unreliable, unreliable, right moment.

- [00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=268) Unreliable, unreliable, right moment. Selin, 8-10, Seven, eight, looking, Both can

- [00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=273) Selin, 8-10, Seven, eight, looking, Both can be translated as unsafe again. Right, should we

- [00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=277) be translated as unsafe again. Right, should we

- [00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=289) say unsafe, unreliable, ten voices are choosing, that is, saying it's not, one or the security system can be

- [00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=293) saying it's not, one or the security system can be rejected by its users. In other words, you

- [00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=294) rejected by its users. In other words, you

- [00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=305) can never tolerate the system you use leaking your information, especially to this sea, in most cases. So, if this significant failure causes economic losses or

- [00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=308) significant failure causes economic losses or physical damage, the

- [00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=310) physical damage, the costs of system failure can be very high. For

- [00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=312) costs of system failure can be very high. For example, those who lost their lives in a plane crash

- [00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=316) example, those who lost their lives in a plane crash

- [00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=322) need to be paid very serious compensation, or of course, nothing can

- [00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=324) nothing can be brought back alive from the loss of life. If the bank breaks down, this means that

- [00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=327) be brought back alive from the loss of life. If the bank breaks down, this means that serious money

- [00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=329) serious money is lost in this business, this money must be returned to the people.

- [00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=331) is lost in this business, this money must be returned to the people. Like this, it can cause

- [00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=334) Like this, it can cause both serious physical and economic damage.

- [00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=339) both serious physical and economic damage. Unreliable

- [00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=342) Unreliable systems

- [00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=344) systems can cause information loss with a high recovery cost.

- [00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=346) can cause information loss with a high recovery cost. See. I also want to touch on a good point here.

- [00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=347) See. I also want to touch on a good point here.

- [00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=353) There's a very serious cryptocurrency dream right now, right? That's cryptocoin Jin is never money. That means it's

- [00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=356) cryptocoin Jin is never money. That means it's not very true. These systems are

- [00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=360) not very true. These systems are not the most reliable in most cases. For

- [00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=361) not the most reliable in most cases. For example, people get hacked. All their money

- [00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=363) example, people get hacked. All their money can be lost in an instant.

- [00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=365) can be lost in an instant. There's no authority you can turn to. Do you know what these systems

- [00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=368) There's no authority you can turn to. Do you know what these systems are used for? They're always

- [00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=369) are used for? They're always as a payment tool. For example,

- [00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=373) as a payment tool. For example, very recently, they're trying to

- [00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=378) very recently, they're trying to tell me what ransomware is. If you ask what a ransomware is,

- [00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=380) tell me what ransomware is. If you ask what a ransomware is, a person can kidnap someone and ask for a video. For example, if you kidnap someone and

- [00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=384) a person can kidnap someone and ask for a video. For example, if you kidnap someone and ask for a video, there are wick software with ransomware.

- [00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=387) ask for a video, there are wick software with ransomware.

- [00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=396) This is an oil test. Let's write "Oil," which is neutralized. Let's

- [00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=401) write "Oil," which is neutralized. Let's see, it says "

- [00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=404) see, it says " Yes, year, heart, panet." Hah, five, five

- [00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=411) Yes, year, heart, panet." Hah, five, five million liras. What does that mean?

- [00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=413) million liras. What does that mean? American Oil final. Oil

- [00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=419) American Oil final. Oil producers paid $5 million to hackers.

- [00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=423) producers paid $5 million to hackers.

- [00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=427) Do you know what it is? He probably paid as a sheep. Let 's see, one sheep. It doesn't matter which sheep it

- [00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=430) 's see, one sheep. It doesn't matter which sheep it is, but a cryptocurrency.

- [00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=432) is, but a cryptocurrency. This is how people are

- [00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=436) This is how people are added to systems. These mountains work like this.

- [00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=441) added to systems. These mountains work like this. Give a computer and take the last one.

- [00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=443) Give a computer and take the last one. When you enter the ransomware, it selects all the information on that computer

- [00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=445) When you enter the ransomware, it selects all the information on that computer according to the extensions.

- [00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=448) according to the extensions. Of course, it says password, so the software

- [00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=452) Of course, it says password, so the software is that information. It doesn't decrease, it first encrypts,

- [00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=454) is that information. It doesn't decrease, it first encrypts, then deletes, so your only way to

- [00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=457) then deletes, so your only way to recover that system and recover your data is to

- [00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=459) recover that system and recover your data is to

- [00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=470) get your password from the hacker, meaning the password used for the encrypted encryption algorithm.

- [00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=474) meaning the password used for the encrypted encryption algorithm.

- [00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=478) You can't access your data without getting this password. That's why hackers are

- [00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=482) why hackers are paid with "Bir Umut" in very critical systems. This increases the

- [00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=484) paid with "Bir Umut" in very critical systems. This increases the cost of recovering your data

- [00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=487) cost of recovering your data significantly. What happens is, like my mother did here,

- [00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=490) significantly. What happens is, like my mother did here,

- [00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=496) because a very large company has been added here, they say, "Let's pay the hackers, let's recover our passwords and continue production."

- [00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=498) let's recover our passwords and continue production."

- [00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=504) In fact, you hear about cryptocurrencies in many places that really have no benefit to the world. There's

- [00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=507) many places that really have no benefit to the world. There's no such thing as a project,

- [00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=509) no such thing as a project, no, man, technology of the future. This is

- [00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=511) no, man, technology of the future. This is all a story in the group. The essence of money is

- [00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=514) all a story in the group. The essence of money is triplo.

- [00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=516) triplo. Some people make very serious profits through exchanges. Each

- [00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=519) Some people make very serious profits through exchanges. Each one tries to attract more people to join

- [00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=522) one tries to attract more people to join so they can buy at a higher price

- [00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=524) so they can buy at a higher price and turn over the profits.

- [00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=528) and turn over the profits. In fact, Çiftlik Bank is no different. It

- [00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=530) In fact, Çiftlik Bank is no different. It only works globally. It also

- [00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=535) only works globally. It also

- [00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=545) facilitates many things like money laundering, hacking, tax evasion, and so on. That's why I

- [00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=548) That's why I

- [00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=553) advocate for the ban of Kırıklı exchanges, yes. They say, " Cryptocurrency blocking can't be prevented." No, it

- [00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=555) Cryptocurrency blocking can't be prevented." No, it can be easily prevented. If crypto

- [00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=556) can be easily prevented. If crypto exchanges are prohibited from working with banks, it

- [00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=559) exchanges are prohibited from working with banks, it can be easily prevented, and

- [00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=565) can be easily prevented, and

- [00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=570) I think governments will make this decision in the future. For example, cryptocurrency. Just go ahead, graphics cards

- [00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=573) go ahead, graphics cards have become unavailable. It also causes serious problems,

- [00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=576) have become unavailable. It also causes serious problems, and most importantly, electricity. We are

- [00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=579) and most importantly, electricity. We are already a

- [00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=580) already a country dependent on imported electricity. For example, gas, for

- [00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=584) country dependent on imported electricity. For example, gas, for example, we produce electricity. This is why it

- [00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=587) example, we produce electricity. This is why it increases our electricity costs.

- [00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=589) increases our electricity costs.

- [00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=594) It increases the cost of the electricity we use at home, it increases the price, and so on. I can count the number of harmful ones, and you can't even

- [00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=596) I can count the number of harmful ones, and you can't even list a single benefit to me. For

- [00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=598) list a single benefit to me. For example, I'm asking this to

- [00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=601) example, I'm asking this to

- [00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=607) those who defend money on social media and so on. But there are no benefits. Yes, let's continue,

- [00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=610) Yes, let's continue, don't get off topic, but as said,

- [00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=613) don't get off topic, but as said, unreliable systems can

- [00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=614) unreliable systems can cause information loss with a high recovery cost,

- [00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=616) cause information loss with a high recovery cost, and as you can see right now,

- [00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=619) and as you can see right now, just 73 days ago, the news is

- [00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=623) just 73 days ago, the news is already brazed. For example, in America, for example, hundreds

- [00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=625) already brazed. For example, in America, for example, hundreds of millions of dollars

- [00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=627) of millions of dollars are said to be paid to hackers every year. What's

- [00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=629) are said to be paid to hackers every year. What's going on? It was paid with cryptocurrency. So, let's say the

- [00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=633) going on? It was paid with cryptocurrency. So, let's say the reasons for failure are

- [00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=636) reasons for failure are

- [00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=644) failures due to freezing, design, production errors, or components reaching the end of their natural life. This is a software error. This Software technical

- [00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=649) This is a software error. This Software technical features fail

- [00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=650) features fail due to design or implementation errors.

- [00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=652) due to design or implementation errors. Operational failures are caused by human

- [00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=655) Operational failures are caused by human operators making mistakes. Perhaps

- [00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=657) operators making mistakes. Perhaps

- [00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=663) this is the biggest problem facing the high society technical system, and system failures are the biggest obstacles. Software can now

- [00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=665) Software can now be developed quite securely, especially in Open Source

- [00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=667) be developed quite securely, especially in Open Source software. Since

- [00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=670) software. Since software is read and verified, it's

- [00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=673) software is read and verified, it's very difficult to be prone to errors in hardware, and

- [00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=676) very difficult to be prone to errors in hardware, and high-quality hardware is now

- [00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=678) high-quality hardware is now available. However,

- [00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=681) available. However, when humans are involved, no matter how reliable our software is,

- [00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=685) when humans are involved, no matter how reliable our software is, errors

- [00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=688) errors become obvious. For example, what did they do on Twitter?

- [00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=690) become obvious. For example, what did they do on Twitter? They

- [00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=693) They added a vulnerability used in the movie. Or rather, let's not say adding it.

- [00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=695) added a vulnerability used in the movie. Or rather, let's not say adding it. With this vulnerability,

- [00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=697) With this vulnerability, I can tweet from any account I want. For

- [00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=699) I can tweet from any account I want. For example, they committed cryptocurrency

- [00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=701) example, they committed cryptocurrency fraud, and it's back in the clips. Let me

- [00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=703) fraud, and it's back in the clips. Let me remind you right away:

- [00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=706) remind you right away: Twitter hacking. Let's

- [00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=713) Twitter hacking. Let's write it like this. It means it's already been done from Wikipedia.

- [00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=718) write it like this. It means it's already been done from Wikipedia.

- [00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=724) Many accounts tweeted about Bitcoin fraud, and we tried. I was

- [00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=730) told I would send 2-3 times the amount back to cryptocurrency routes, and many people sent it. Look,

- [00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=732) people sent it. Look, they stole 110,000 US dollars, for example. They

- [00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=735) they stole 110,000 US dollars, for example. They could have caused much greater damage. I

- [00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=737) could have caused much greater damage. I mean, they could have even caused a war or crisis between countries.

- [00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=739) mean, they could have even caused a war or crisis between countries.

- [00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=744) Look, as you can see, Apple, for example,

- [00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=753) says, "We will send two-story money to anyone who sends money to this address within 30 minutes." This is that. This is a box. Let's continue from there. Yes, and the

- [00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=761) a box. Let's continue from there. Yes, and the reason for this error was again a social-technical

- [00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=763) reason for this error was again a social-technical error, in other words, social engineering. What

- [00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=765) error, in other words, social engineering. What they did was that they obtained the passwords of

- [00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=768) they did was that they obtained the passwords of people who had access to Twitter's management tools,

- [00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=770) people who had access to Twitter's management tools, and thus,

- [00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=775) and thus, this system was not an angle, in other words, they

- [00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=777) this system was not an angle, in other words, they achieved it through human error. Basic

- [00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=781) achieved it through human error. Basic reliability features are

- [00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=782) reliability features are dependability, in other words, reliability. Home.

- [00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=786) dependability, in other words, reliability. Home. Elif, come on, availability, that is, the system should always

- [00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=788) Elif, come on, availability, that is, the system should always be online, it should be running.

- [00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=791) be online, it should be running. How much can I trust the system in the car? Look,

- [00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=794) How much can I trust the system in the car? Look, what did she write here, the description,

- [00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=795) what did she write here, the description, there was no tablet. System to deliver services. Sprite,

- [00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=799) there was no tablet. System to deliver services. Sprite, that is, the system

- [00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=802) that is, the system will offer this service, the

- [00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=806) will offer this service, the unit will be able to

- [00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=809) unit will be able to deliver it as promised. What did she say to your home before?

- [00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=811) deliver it as promised. What did she say to your home before? Yes, the bulk system to deliver

- [00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=813) Yes, the bulk system to deliver services and Quest. The system's

- [00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=819) services and Quest. The system's ability to stop when services are requested.

- [00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=822) ability to stop when services are requested. Seyitli security. A tidy system.

- [00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=825) Seyitli security. A tidy system. Operasi. A minute of traffic remains. What does that mean

- [00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=828) Operasi. A minute of traffic remains. What does that mean ? If the system does not work without a serious failure.

- [00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=833) ? If the system does not work without a serious failure.

- [00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=838) Security. Look, if it is translated as security, the state is gold. The only system. It's

- [00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=1533) We can initially achieve very high reliability with a small fee, but as your reliability level increases,

- [00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=1722) provide the requested services. Both of these features

- [00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=1724) Both of these features can be expressed quantitatively. For example, 0999

- [00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=1727) can be expressed quantitatively. For example, 0999 can be used. You can hear it from behind.

- [00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=1729) can be used. You can hear it from behind.

- [00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=1734) It's been ninety-nine percent online for a full day. Because it's Turkish, the system's time is 199 for the new

- [00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=1739) system's time is 199 for the new system. The time is 0999. The system will be able to use 199 for

- [00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=1748) system. The time is 0999. The system will be able to use 199 for

- [00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=1760) 39 time. Ha ha. It means that 100, 99.9 times

- [00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=1766) Ha ha. It means that 100, 99.9 times is operational. So,

- [00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=1768) is operational. So, for example, the system in 100 hours.

- [00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=1772) for example, the system in 100 hours. Let's say one hour is now.

- [00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=1775) Let's say one hour is now. How long is the system offline? 190,

- [00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=1778) How long is the system offline? 190, 99, 99, 99 hours online in Iğdır. It's only one

- [00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=1782) 99, 99, 99 hours online in Iğdır. It's only one hour. That is, one hour is only one hour. If this

- [00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=1786) hour. That is, one hour is only one hour. If this system is available for hours, you can't use it. So, some

- [00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=1790) system is available for hours, you can't use it. So, some systems are really critical.

- [00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=1792) systems are really critical. What do banks do?

- [00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=1794) What do banks do?

- [00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=1803) For example, they're doing maintenance during the least frequent time people use it. If

- [00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=1819) a system is available, sometimes it's possible to consider system availability within the scope of system reliability. Frankly, if a system isn't available, that is, if it's not

- [00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=1820) system is available, sometimes it's possible to consider system availability within the scope of system reliability. Frankly, if a system isn't available, that is, if it's not available, then specify that. If it's not, then

- [00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=1822) available, then specify that. If it's not, then

- [00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=1827) it means the system is providing its services. However, it's

- [00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=1832) possible to have systems with low trust. System failures should be present, and as

- [00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=1838) long as they can recover quickly and without damaging data, some system failures may not be a problem. Therefore, availability is

- [00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=1842) not be a problem. Therefore, availability is

- [00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=1848) best evaluated as a separate feature, reflecting that the system's service delivery will not be maintained.

- [00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=1852) If the system needs to be taken out of service to repair failures, the availability period is taken into account.

- [00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=1854) availability period is taken into account. So,

- [00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=1859) So, say the system will be taken out of service, if it's out of service, it's

- [00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=1862) say the system will be taken out of service, if it's out of service, it's usable, like this. Join the simple timeframe.

- [00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=1864) usable, like this. Join the simple timeframe.

- [00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=1883) reflect the user's perception of a system's reliability, and assumptions about the environment in which the system will be used

- [00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=1885) about the environment in which the system will be used may be incorrect. Using a system

- [00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=1894) in a university environment. Why? Because,

- [00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=1897) Why? Because, for example, three or five people in an office

- [00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=1899) for example, three or five people in an office will access the system, and thousands of

- [00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=1901) will access the system, and thousands of people may need to travel to a university. For example,

- [00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=1905) people may need to travel to a university. For example, security.

- [00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=1963) yes, it will be annoying. But this may not cause a life-threatening problem. So, it's

- [00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=1967) not cause a life-threatening problem. So, it's manageable, but

- [00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=1971) manageable, but let's say the air conditioner doesn't work. This is annoying,

- [00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=1973) let's say the air conditioner doesn't work. This is annoying, but it's not life-threatening. You

- [00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=1976) but it's not life-threatening. You sweat a lot. You or you can meet, but

- [00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=1979) sweat a lot. You or you can meet, but when there's an engine failure, it

- [00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=1982) when there's an engine failure, it prevents you from using your car. It

- [00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=1984) prevents you from using your car. It may even cause accidents or something.

- [00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=1987) may even cause accidents or something. Therefore, I believe

- [00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=1991) Therefore, I believe more weight

- [00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=1994) more weight should be given to factors that will have serious consequences. Reliability and

- [00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=1998) should be given to factors that will have serious consequences. Reliability and features. Reliability can only be

- [00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2002) features. Reliability can only be formally defined according to a system specification.

- [00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2004) formally defined according to a system specification. So, a failure is a

- [00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2008) So, a failure is a deviation from the specification.

- [00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2011) deviation from the specification. Let's look at the English here. Reliability is reliability, which is almost every reliability here.

- [00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2015) Let's look at the English here. Reliability is reliability, which is almost every reliability here.

- [00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2020) So, and the other is not dependability. So,

- [00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2025) and the other is not dependability. So, if it's in the system specification, if

- [00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2028) if it's in the system specification, if it's being sold from it, it's unreliable.

- [00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2031) it's being sold from it, it's unreliable. However, many specifications are missing or

- [00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2034) However, many specifications are missing or incorrect. Therefore, a

- [00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2037) incorrect. Therefore, a system that meets the specification

- [00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2040) system that meets the specification can fail from the user's perspective. One, while you're

- [00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2043) can fail from the user's perspective. One, while you're extracting the features here on the site,

- [00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2045) extracting the features here on the site, if you hear that the system isn't good enough, it

- [00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2049) if you hear that the system isn't good enough, it

- [00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2053) might fail from the market. It's successful for you in terms of reliability because the system

- [00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2056) in terms of reliability because the system fully meets the specifications.

- [00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2058) fully meets the specifications. But it's especially incomplete, it's incorrect, it's

- [00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2060) But it's especially incomplete, it's incorrect, it's

- [00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2065) never translated as "I mentioned here," especially sound would be more accurate.

- [00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2078) Also, users don't read the specifications. Therefore,

- [00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2079) don't read the specifications. Therefore, they don't know how the system should behave.

- [00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2082) they don't know how the system should behave. Therefore, the perceived day is

- [00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2084) Therefore, the perceived day is more important in the application, meaning that

- [00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2091) meeting the user's demands is more important,

- [00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2093) more important, and the perception of usability is

- [00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2096) and the perception of usability is generally expressed

- [00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2099) generally expressed

- [00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2104) as the percentage of time the system is available to provide ready-made synchronization services. For example, 99.95 percent, so

- [00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2111) For example, 99.95 percent, so let me assign eveylibil. However, these two factors are not

- [00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2113) let me assign eveylibil. However, these two factors are not taken into account. So,

- [00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2116) taken into account. So, it gets stuck like this without taking into account two different factors. One is a

- [00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2119) it gets stuck like this without taking into account two different factors. One is a service outage. What is the

- [00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2121) service outage. What is the number of users affected?

- [00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2123) number of users affected? Loss of service in the middle of the night is less important than the service

- [00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2125) Loss of service in the middle of the night is less important than the service during the most optimal usage periods for most systems.

- [00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2126) during the most optimal usage periods for most systems. One is

- [00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2131) One is 199.95. But the user who will be using it at that moment is

- [00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2135) 199.95. But the user who will be using it at that moment is actually not being used.

- [00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2140) actually not being used. Or do you choose such a time?

- [00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2143) Or do you choose such a time? Then who would use it anyway?

- [00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2146) Then who would use it anyway? So no one would be aggrieved.

- [00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2150) So no one would be aggrieved. But this is the day, for example. What's going on here? It's

- [00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2154) But this is the day, for example. What's going on here? It's not one in a thousand, but

- [00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2158) not one in a thousand, but five in a ten thousand. There's a five in a ten thousand unused situation. If

- [00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2160) five in a ten thousand. There's a five in a ten thousand unused situation. If this five in a ten thousand usage is at its

- [00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2163) this five in a ten thousand usage is at its peak, it might

- [00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2165) peak, it might

- [00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2170) affect even one percent of your usage. In this case, it's never five in a ten thousand, but one in a hundred. That's

- [00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2174) one in a hundred. That's why the time it was interrupted is

- [00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2177) why the time it was interrupted is actually very important.

- [00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2180) actually very important. The longer

- [00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2183) The longer it is, the longer it is in the evening. Several

- [00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2185) it is, the longer it is in the evening. Several short interruptions are less likely to be disruptive than one long interruption. The

- [00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2187) short interruptions are less likely to be disruptive than one long interruption. The

- [00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2194) duration of very long interruptions is a special day issue. We might have a translation error here, and

- [00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2205) We might have a translation error here, and

- [00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2220) that's possible. Yes, several short interruptions are likely to be more disruptive than one long interruption.

- [00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2222) interruptions are likely to be more disruptive than one long interruption.

- [00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2228) Do you have long interruptions? So, were all these interruptions a single time,

- [00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2229) were all these interruptions a single time, or did small interruptions occur

- [00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2231) or did small interruptions occur multiple times without much disturbance?

- [00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2233) multiple times without much disturbance? This is also an important element. Yes,

- [00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2237) This is also an important element. Yes, know this. Key points. What is this?

- [00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2240) know this. Key points. What is this? Reliability in the system reflects the user's

- [00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2243) Reliability in the system reflects the user's trust in that system. I

- [00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2246) trust in that system. I mean, as I mentioned, reliability is a

- [00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2249) mean, as I mentioned, reliability is a series of related non-functional system

- [00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2251) series of related non-functional system features. Usability,

- [00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2252) features. Usability, reliability, safety. And security is

- [00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2254) reliability, safety. And security is a term used to recognize, to recognize,

- [00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2257) a term used to recognize, to recognize, see what he said here.

- [00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2261) see what he said here. Non-functional, that is, functional features

- [00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2263) Non-functional, that is, functional features were different. If you remember, these

- [00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2266) were different. If you remember, these non-functional features are also

- [00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2267) non-functional features are also very important

- [00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2269) very important features, but they are not functions. For

- [00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2272) features, but they are not functions. For example, a system being 100% online is

- [00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2274) example, a system being 100% online is not a function. Can

- [00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2276) not a function. Can I explain? That is not an action like that,

- [00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2278) I explain? That is not an action like that,

- [00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2283) but for example, the ability to automatically lower and raise the windows while driving is a

- [00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2286) automatically lower and raise the windows while driving is a feature that works. You have

- [00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2288) feature that works. You have features, but for example, a car, for example, start and

- [00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2292) features, but for example, a car, for example, start and run. What can we say? A car can do

- [00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2295) run. What can we say? A car can do 200,000 kilometers with 100,000 kilometers? What are the

- [00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2297) 200,000 kilometers with 100,000 kilometers? What are the things that you don't have?

- [00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2300) things that you don't have? Especially diet. Maybe we can define

- [00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2303) Especially diet. Maybe we can define a system's availability. It is the probability that

- [00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2306) a system's availability. It is the probability that services are available when it is done. The

- [00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2308) services are available when it is done. The

- [00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2314) reliability of a system is that the system services are delivered in a way that indicates that the system is delivering.

- [00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2316) delivered in a way that indicates that the system is delivering. So, this polish is my ticket. This ticket is

- [00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2319) So, this polish is my ticket. This ticket is pushes this dependable ticket to the house. This is also the Master.

- [00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2324) pushes this dependable ticket to the house. This is also the Master. Let's leave it together, right?

- [00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2326) Let's leave it together, right? Yes, later, security and

- [00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2373) human behavior that results in errors entering a system?

- [00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2378) There was a station in the wild weather system. If you recall, a programmer might decide that the way to calculate the time for the next transmission is to

- [00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2381) programmer might decide that the way to calculate the time for the next transmission is to

- [00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2385) add one hour to the current time. This

- [00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2390) current time. This transmission time

- [00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2393) transmission time works except when it's between 23:00 and midnight.

- [00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2396) works except when it's between 23:00 and midnight. In the 24-hour clock, midnight is 0-0. Let's

- [00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2400) In the 24-hour clock, midnight is 0-0. Let's see what happens. This system error

- [00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2407) see what happens. This system error can cause an error. A

- [00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2409) can cause an error. A system error code is the addition of one hour to the last production time, regardless of whether the error code is

- [00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2414) system error code is the addition of one hour to the last production time, regardless of whether the error code is greater than or equal to 23:00.

- [00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2417) greater than or equal to 23:00.

- [00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2426) So, here's the code the programmer wrote. This is a system

- [00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2429) here's the code the programmer wrote. This is a system error. The system has

- [00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2431) error. The system has

- [00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2437) generated an erroneous system state that could lead to unexpected system behavior. The production time value is incorrectly set when jeans are executed. 002 is 24x instead of 002.

- [00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2443) 002 is 24x instead of 002. This system error

- [00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2446) This system error did not provide a service where the system was expecting fabrics.

- [00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2449) did not provide a service where the system was expecting fabrics. An event occurred at a time when time passed, so

- [00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2451) An event occurred at a time when time passed, so weather data

- [00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2452) weather data is not sent. Now, look at

- [00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2464) these three different error situations here. Do you know how this happened?

- [00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2467) you know how this happened? Our goal is that the time

- [00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2475) Our goal is that the time is between 23:00 and 24:00. I

- [00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2484) is between 23:00 and 24:00. I don't want transmissions except between 23:00 and 24:00. I

- [00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2488) don't want transmissions except between 23:00 and 24:00. I mean, let's

- [00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2494) mean, let's say this. Let me explain it this way.

- [00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2500) say this. Let me explain it this way. Yes, you have a weather

- [00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2503) Yes, you have a weather station in our system. We say that

- [00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2505) station in our system. We say that reporting should be hourly, then

- [00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2508) reporting should be hourly, then what hours are there? For example,

- [00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2510) what hours are there? For example, if you do it according to the American time system,

- [00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2514) if you do it according to the American time system, how many hours are there from zero to 12?

- [00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2518) how many hours are there from zero to 12? But if we

- [00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2522) But if we do it according to the 24-hour system, how

- [00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2525) do it according to the 24-hour system, how many hours are there from one to 24? 24 becomes 00 again,

- [00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2529) many hours are there from one to 24? 24 becomes 00 again, that is, 23:59. Now the program says, "Let

- [00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2533) that is, 23:59. Now the program says, "Let me add a fake hour."

- [00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2535) me add a fake hour." Okay, that's a good logic, let me

- [00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2537) Okay, that's a good logic, let me send it last. For example, it sent at 23:33.

- [00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2541) send it last. For example, it sent at 23:33.

- [00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2545) Yes, when you add it at this time, it should be the income hour. Should the sending time be

- [00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2547) be the income hour. Should the sending time be 24/33? Should it be 00:33? It should

- [00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2550) 24/33? Should it be 00:33? It should be 00:33. But what happens if the

- [00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2554) be 00:33. But what happens if the programmer makes a mistake and

- [00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2556) programmer makes a mistake and doesn't check it? 24/33 becomes 24/33. This is

- [00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2561) doesn't check it? 24/33 becomes 24/33. This is an error. What will happen when it is 24/32? It will

- [00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2564) an error. What will happen when it is 24/32? It will never send data again. This is

- [00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2567) never send data again. This is a system error, but who

- [00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2569) a system error, but who caused it? Was it caused by human error?

- [00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2572) caused it? Was it caused by human error? Is there another situation?

- [00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2579) Is there another situation? This is this: 24 instead of 00. We already

- [00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2585) This is this: 24 instead of 00. We already did this. It could be that the country won't

- [00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2593) did this. It could be that the country won't send it because it has passed. This

- [00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2597) send it because it has passed. This could also lead to a service delivery failure.

- [00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2599) could also lead to a service delivery failure. So, in this case, could the error resulting from the programmer's logic error at the time

- [00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2602) So, in this case, could the error resulting from the programmer's logic error at the time

- [00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2610) lead to a lot of system errors? Yes, what is this potential error situation

- [00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2613) Yes, what is this potential error situation for this system? But if he had done something like this

- [00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2618) for this system? But if he had done something like this instead of adding every hour in the program,

- [00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2621) instead of adding every hour in the program, for example, the programming language he's using

- [00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2624) for example, the programming language he's using has an add-hour function.

- [00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2628) has an add-hour function. If he had done that, he could have automatically

- [00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2632) If he had done that, he could have automatically moved the process to the next day

- [00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2635) moved the process to the next day or the 24-hour system.

- [00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2639) or the 24-hour system. There's a conditional daytime class.

- [00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2642) There's a conditional daytime class. Don't you want the error? There's a tract. Look at

- [00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2646) Don't you want the error? There's a tract. Look at the class, but I need to look at it. Anyway, let's

- [00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2649) the class, but I need to look at it. Anyway, let's say the class object is this object.

- [00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2652) say the class object is this object. What happens when we add a time? It can

- [00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2655) What happens when we add a time? It can automatically set everything, such as the day, hour, year, and so on.

- [00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2658) automatically set everything, such as the day, hour, year, and so on. This way, you can

- [00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2660) This way, you can easily set the time to an hour later.

- [00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2663) easily set the time to an hour later.

- [00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2669) Yes, there are errors and malfunctions. Turn a new error into a House and Wires error

- [00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2674) error into a House and Wires error and malfunction. Let's say errors and malfunctions are a result of

- [00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2680) and malfunction. Let's say errors and malfunctions are a result of system errors caused by errors in the circular system.

- [00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2682) system errors caused by errors in the circular system.

- [00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2686) However, errors don't necessarily lead to system errors. Here, I

- [00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2689) lead to system errors. Here, I suppose a malfunction means

- [00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2694) suppose a malfunction means subscriber, the

- [00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2697) subscriber, the biggest thing I'll eat this minute. What can I say?

- [00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2704) biggest thing I'll eat this minute. What can I say? Cheese failures. Even

- [00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2709) Cheese failures. Even system transitions, for example, the connection is like that. The

- [00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2716) system transitions, for example, the connection is like that. The system is always straight. It's

- [00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2719) system is always straight. It's caused by errors. Let's

- [00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2732) say this. However, errors do not necessarily lead

- [00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2734) errors do not necessarily lead to system failures. The

- [00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2738) to system failures. The

- [00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2743) system state resulting from the failure can be temporary and can be

- [00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2745) can be temporary and can be corrected before an error occurs.

- [00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2748) corrected before an error occurs. Faulty code is never executed. Errors

- [00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2751) Faulty code is never executed. Errors do not necessarily lead to system failures.

- [00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2755) do not necessarily lead to system failures. This can be corrected with built-in error detection and

- [00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2758) This can be corrected with built-in error detection and recovery. Arzu

- [00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2760) recovery. Arzu

- [00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2766) can be protected with complex built-in protection systems. These can be protected with protection facilities. For example, these

- [00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2772) can protect system resources from system errors. Yes, we are having some trouble with the Turkish translation, but this way,

- [00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2776) we are having some trouble with the Turkish translation, but this way, this input-output mapping match mapping

- [00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2779) this input-output mapping match mapping as a system import program output

- [00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2783) as a system import program output sertsin putka zinger onu sal tuseno Salt.

- [00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2787) sertsin putka zinger onu sal tuseno Salt. So, we have an input set that enters the program

- [00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2789) So, we have an input set that enters the program and an output set. There are also

- [00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2792) and an output set. There are also inputs that cause errors, and

- [00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2795) inputs that cause errors, and these also cause incorrect outputs. Lara,

- [00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2797) these also cause incorrect outputs. Lara, software usage patterns.

- [00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2801) software usage patterns. User one user two users three

- [00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2805) User one user two users three and incorrect inputs in these outputs.

- [00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2811) and incorrect inputs in these outputs. Yes, it is very important that

- [00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2813) Yes, it is very important that reliability in use. Removing two percent of errors in a system

- [00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2816) reliability in use. Removing two percent of errors in a system

- [00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2823) and increasing confidence by x percent.

- [00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2829) So, there is no direct one-to-one relationship. What should I do? A research study shows that

- [00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2831) What should I do? A research study shows that 160% of product defects will be eliminated

- [00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2836) 160% of product defects will be eliminated with King confidence. Why do

- [00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2837) with King confidence. Why do you think it showed a 100% improvement?

- [00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2840) you think it showed a 100% improvement? Because those parts

- [00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2843) Because those parts

- [00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2848) might be very few users encountering those flaws. In this case, this only provides a 100% improvement.

- [00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2851) only provides a 100% improvement. Program flaws

- [00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2854) Program flaws can be in sections of code that are rarely executed. See, they

- [00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2855) can be in sections of code that are rarely executed. See, they

- [00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2861) are rarely used, so they are never encountered by users. Therefore,

- [00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2862) never encountered by users. Therefore, their elimination

- [00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2865) their elimination

- [00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2874) does not affect the perceived reliability. Users can use warnings to avoid system features that could be successful for them.

- [00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2875) system features that could be successful for them.

- [00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2880) So, if a user encounters an error, if

- [00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2882) user encounters an error, if there is a way to avoid this error,

- [00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2885) there is a way to avoid this error, this user can change their behavior.

- [00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2887) this user can change their behavior. A program with known bugs can

- [00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2890) A program with known bugs can therefore

- [00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2892) therefore still be

- [00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2894) still be perceived as reliable by puzzles. A yes,

- [00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2902) reliability success. Error prevention.

- [00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2913) Development techniques are used to minimize the likelihood of errors or trap errors before they cause errors. Fault detection and correction. Verification and validation techniques that increase the likelihood of

- [00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2923) And one person and change techniques

- [00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2927) person and change techniques are used. Fault tolerance. System

- [00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2931) are used. Fault tolerance. System errors do not cause system errors. And when you say

- [00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2934) errors do not cause system errors. And when you say system errors here,

- [00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2938) system errors here, of course, it

- [00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2940) of course, it sounds illogical, but this

- [00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2945) sounds illogical, but this yes. Come on, this page.

- [00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2948) yes. Come on, this page. Ercan Tekniksa, the executing one right there

- [00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2954) Ercan Tekniksa, the executing one right there on the system board, straight to the system Erdost.

- [00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2959) on the system board, straight to the system Erdost. What should we say here instead of an error? I wonder if it

- [00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2962) What should we say here instead of an error? I wonder if it means a system error or a volt error. But

- [00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2964) means a system error or a volt error. But this system flaws, let's say this, are

- [00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2969) this system flaws, let's say this, are system errors. Runtime techniques are used to ensure that these flaws do not cause system errors

- [00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2971) system errors. Runtime techniques are used to ensure that these flaws do not cause system errors and that system errors

- [00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2975) and that system errors lead to correct site stores.

- [00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2980) lead to correct site stores.

- [00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2987) What does this mean? Runtime techniques mean that while the system

- [00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2989) Runtime techniques mean that while the system is running, there is

- [00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=2991) is running, there is

- [00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=3007) no risk of human injury or death, that is, without causing physical damage,

- [00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=3014) and let's say in Ados, without harming the system's environment. Although we can say that true physical damage is

- [00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=3016) Although we can say that true physical damage is also included in the environment. Because it is

- [00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=3017) also included in the environment. Because it is

- [00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=3022) a system feature that reflects the ability to operate normally or abnormally. In other words, if

- [00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=3041) important to consider that software failure is now critical because it includes software-based control systems. What does this mean? This means that we need to pay

- [00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=3044) What does this mean? This means that we need to pay more attention to software security.

- [00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=3045) more attention to software security. Because

- [00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=3048) Because all systems that are critical in the event of a failure are

- [00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=3050) all systems that are critical in the event of a failure are now written

- [00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=3051) now written and controlled. For example, a

- [00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=3054) and controlled. For example, a dam is now controlled by

- [00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=3057) dam is now controlled by software to determine when to open and close the dam gates.

- [00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=3059) software to determine when to open and close the dam gates. Therefore, it is critical.

- [00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=3063) Therefore, it is critical. So, a person manually

- [00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=3066) So, a person manually opening and closing the gates in the software. Is it serious? Is this a serious

- [00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=3068) opening and closing the gates in the software. Is it serious? Is this a serious error in many places? It

- [00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=3070) error in many places? It could cause a collapse, which

- [00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=3072) could cause a collapse, which could lead to loss of human life. That's why

- [00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=3074) could lead to loss of human life. That's why software security is

- [00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=3076) software security is so important for safety in almost every

- [00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=3081) system. Nuclear power plants have been around for a very long

- [00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=3084) Nuclear power plants have been around for a very long time. How were the first nuclear power plants

- [00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=3086) time. How were the first nuclear power plants controlled? Probably

- [00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=3088) controlled? Probably with completely manual systems,

- [00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=3091) with completely manual systems, by humans. But now they are controlled by software.

- [00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=3093) by humans. But now they are controlled by software. That's why very important security

- [00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=3097) That's why very important security requirements are usually specific

- [00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=3098) requirements are usually specific requirements. In other words,

- [00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=3101) requirements. In other words, instead of specifying necessary system services, they

- [00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=3103) instead of specifying necessary system services, they exclude undesirable situations. These

- [00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=3107) exclude undesirable situations. These create security requirements if desired.

- [00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=3110) create security requirements if desired.

- [00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=3151) There seems to be a sentence error here, right? So, what this means is that instead of specifying necessary features,

- [00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=3155) instead of specifying necessary features, it says, "These should not be the case." In other words, these

- [00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=3161) situations are encountered. Instead of giving all the requirements, they

- [00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=3164) Instead of giving all the requirements, they wrote like this in the book, but we

- [00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=3175) can think of it as specifying bad situations and offering solutions.

- [00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=3189) For example, the insulin pump control system, when a failure

- [00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=3194) occurs, directly affects and endangers human life. It is

- [00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=3196) affects and endangers human life. It is very critical in terms of security. Secondly,

- [00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=3199) very critical in terms of security. Secondly, 42 systems failures cause failures

- [00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=3202) 42 systems failures cause failures in other social technical fantasy systems,

- [00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=3214) affects them. Failures resulting from errors

- [00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=3224) can affect other critical systems at the first level, for example, in the mental health management system of the mental health hospital, in the

- [00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=3246) does not directly affect a patient, but what can happen with the unsuccessful and incorrect treatment applied as a result,

- [00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=3249) with the unsuccessful and incorrect treatment applied as a result, and the patient's health

- [00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=3254) and the patient's health can be harmed. This is also critical for the second level of security.

- [00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=3466) injured and the pump user can die. So you see, damage

- [00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=3468) die. So you see, damage ranges from the smallest to the largest.

- [00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=3471) ranges from the smallest to the largest. Hazard severity is an assessment of the

- [00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=3527) tends to be arbitrary. However, let's

- [00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=3546) look at the probability in single quotes. The probability of a danger occurring is one divided by one hundred. The probability of a dangerous event not occurring is one. It's also illogical. So, if a danger can occur with a one percent chance, we call it probable. You even see it in the package inserts when using drugs. For example, a section says 1 in 1000000.

- [00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=3548) section says 1 in 1000000. This period is common, and

- [00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=3567) probability of a sensor failure resulting from a person's pump overdose is probably low. For example, one in 1 billion hours

- [01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=3633) risk of insulin overdose is probably low. For example, is there always a risk of a plane crashing?

- [01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=3636) For example, is there always a risk of a plane crashing? There is, but because it's very rare and very low, we

- [01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=3674) For example, in the event of a potential malfunction at a nuclear facility, they take precautions to minimize them. They

- [01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=3680) in the event of a potential malfunction at a nuclear facility, they take precautions to minimize them. They

- [01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=3685) were building very thick walls.

- [01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=3689) They were developing automatic systems to cool the raki inside, and so on. In other words, they are working very hard to limit damage.

- [01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=3692) words, they are working very hard to limit damage. Normal accidents,

- [01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=3709) needs to take many precautions. It is necessary to use Rhodes. This way, for

- [01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=3714) necessary to use Rhodes. This way, for example, I just said that I

- [01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=3716) example, I just said that I am doing a situation like this. If two disks

- [01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=3719) am doing a situation like this. If two disks fail simultaneously, but the data is lost. This is

- [01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=3721) fail simultaneously, but the data is lost. This is really very unlikely, and

- [01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=3724) really very unlikely, and so what am I doing? I am taking a precaution.

- [01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=3726) so what am I doing? I am taking a precaution.

- [01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=3732) Designing systems so that a single point of failure will not cause an accident

- [01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=3736) is the basic principle of security system design. Almost all accidents are the result of combinations of failures rather than individual failures.

- [01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=3738) failures rather than individual failures.

- [01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=3743) Probably, especially in software control systems, predicting all problem combinations is

- [01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=3746) systems, predicting all problem combinations is almost impossible.

- [01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=3749) almost impossible. Therefore, achieving complete safety

- [01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=3751) Therefore, achieving complete safety is impossible. Accidents are

- [01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=3753) is impossible. Accidents are inevitable. Anyway, it's

- [01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=3760) inevitable. Anyway, it's like plane crashes, but

- [01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=3762) like plane crashes, but there are many systems to prevent them. For example, if a plane's

- [01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=3765) there are many systems to prevent them. For example, if a plane's engine fails, nothing happens.

- [01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=3767) engine fails, nothing happens. All its engines fail, but

- [01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=3768) All its engines fail, but maybe then it will crash. Think about it that way.

- [01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=3770) maybe then it will crash. Think about it that way. Because there are many backup systems.

- [01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=3773) Because there are many backup systems. Accordingly, there are situations and similar situations.

- [01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=3781) there are backup software systems. What can we say? There are processors. One processor burns out.

- [01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=3784) There are processors. One processor burns out. Like me, software security advantages. Although

- [01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=3819) can detect and correct critical operator errors from a security perspective. This is also quite important. How does this message occur? Let's

- [01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=3822) quite important. How does this message occur? Let's consider an example. For example, even if this

- [01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=3829) consider an example. For example, even if this happens, say, a drinking

- [01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=3839) happens, say, a drinking water facility is provided with

- [01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=3843) water facility is provided with these. Of course,

- [01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=3845) these. Of course, you know there's state control. Software is added,

- [01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=3848) you know there's state control. Software is added, and a very high amount of

- [01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=3851) and a very high amount of chlorine is introduced. Here,

- [01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=3854) chlorine is introduced. Here,

- [01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=3860) because the software system has trench coats, it could even make this error. It can also control it. The user

- [01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=3862) can also control it. The user could also make it. For example, let's say

- [01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=3865) could also make it. For example, let's say

- [01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=3869) 5 kilograms. For example, in this case, it should be able to enter a maximum of 50 kilograms. What happens? It

- [01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=3872) What happens? It immediately detects this and

- [01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=3874) immediately detects this and prevents critical operator errors. This

- [01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=3893) This capability is a lion's share of a system feature. Since most systems are networked,

- [01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=3907) a fundamental prerequisite for usability, reliability, and security. Of course, since it's translated from English,

- [01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=3909) course, since it's translated from English, everything is translated the same way.

- [01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=3934) Yes, this is basic security. A system is a

- [01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=3937) this is basic security. A system is a networked system. SV is insecure.

- [01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=3941) networked system. SV is insecure.

- [01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=3946) Statements about reliability and security are unreliable. These statements

- [01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=3950) depend on the execution system and the developed system being the same, but an intrusion can change the execution system or its

- [01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=3953) intrusion can change the execution system or its travels. Therefore,

- [01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=3956) travels. Therefore, reliability and security assurance are

- [01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=3958) reliability and security assurance are no longer valid. So, hackers

- [01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=3966) can do whatever they want to a system. This term refers to

- [01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=3969) This term refers to something valuable that needs to be protected. The software used

- [01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=3972) by the system or the system itself can be exposed to

- [01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=3978) potential loss or damage. This could be data loss or damage,

- [01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=3981) or damage. This could be data loss or damage, or a loss of

- [01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=4010) Yes, an attack is a system security exploit. It is usually

- [01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=4013) exploit. It is usually external to the system and is a deliberate

- [01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=4015) external to the system and is a deliberate attempt to cause damage. Threats that have

- [01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=4018) attempt to cause damage. Threats that have caused loss or damage are situations that have the potential to cause them.

- [01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=4027) We can consider them as opening a system to security control. Encryption is a protective measure that reduces the vulnerability of a system,

- [01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=4035) control system. Here is an example of a security vulnerability. Here is what encryption means.

- [01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=4039) Here is an example of a security vulnerability. Here is what encryption means.

- [01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=4045) When we register on a website, we provide a password, and if we keep this password in a bare form,

- [01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=4047) we provide a password, and if we keep this password in a bare form, and This system database is

- [01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=4052) and This system database is compromised. You can then log in to this system with this password,

- [01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=4056) compromised. You can then log in to this system with this password, and

- [01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=4060) and transactions can be made in your name.

- [01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=4062) transactions can be made in your name. That email address and password are matched.

- [01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=4066) That email address and password are matched. Poae pasta. The

- [01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=4068) Poae pasta. The same password can be tried on other systems using that email address.

- [01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=4071) same password can be tried on other systems using that email address.

- [01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYlwD4XScuQ&t=4078) What can be done to prevent this? For example, those passwords are encrypted with the one-way HDM encryption algorithm
