### Video Transcription


- [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=0) Greetings everyone, in this tutorial, I will show you how to install Kohya GUI trainer

- [00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=5) from scratch.

- [00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=6) How to do SDXL Stable Diffusion X-Large Kohya LoRA training from scratch.

- [00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=12) How to generate amazing quality images after doing LoRA training as you are seeing right

- [00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=18) now.

- [00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=19) Here two showcases for you.

- [00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=21) On the left my real image.

- [00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=23) On the right we see a raw output of Kohya LoRA on SDXL.

- [00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=29) And here another one: on the left it is my real image, on the right we see Kohya LoRA

- [00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=35) trained model generated image, this is also raw output.

- [00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=38) Moreover, I will show you how to do LoRA checkpoint comparison to find the best checkpoint after

- [00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=45) training.

- [00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=46) I will also show how to do inpainting to improve generated faces from your trained LoRA model.

- [00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=53) Moreover, I will show how you can generate stylized images like this even on a realistic

- [00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=60) workflow.

- [00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=61) Don't you worry that if you don't have a strong GPU, I will show you how to do training even

- [00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=67) if you don't have a strong GPU.

- [00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=69) But this is not all.

- [00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=70) I will also show you how you can sort your generated images based on the similarity to

- [00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=76) your training images.

- [00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=77) That will make your job much much easier to find high quality images.

- [00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=83) There isn't any workflow for SDXL yet.

- [00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=87) I have done over 15 trainings to find some optimal parameters.

- [00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=92) This is the first full tutorial that you will find for SDXL training.

- [00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=97) So I have prepared very detailed GitHub readme file.

- [00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=101) All of the instructions, links and commands that we are going to use will be shared here

- [00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=106) and I will update this file as it be necessary.

- [00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=110) So for to be able to use Kohya GUI and follow this tutorial, you need to have python and

- [00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=116) git installed in your computer.

- [00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=118) If you don't know how to install them, I have an excellent tutorial here.

- [00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=122) The link is here.

- [00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=123) This is the download link.

- [00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=124) Watch this tutorial video and you will learn how to install and use python and git.

- [00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=128) To be able to use SDXL LoRAs, currently we need ComfyUI.

- [00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=133) I have prepared an amazing tutorial for that as well.

- [00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=136) Currently it is not published but when you are watching this video, the video link will

- [00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=140) be here.

- [00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=141) Its readme file is already ready.

- [00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=144) I also have an amazing tutorial for Automatic1111 web UI, how to install and use it.

- [00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=149) Automatic1111 is also working on SDXL implementation.

- [00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=154) So when you are watching this video, probably it will also have SDXL Stable Diffusion X-Large

- [00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=160) support.

- [00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=161) So you can also watch this video and learn it.

- [00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=163) One more thing that you need to do is you need

- [00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=171) So this is the Kohya GUI repo link.

- [00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=173) Right click, copy link address, enter the folder where you want to clone and install.

- [00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=178) I will clone it into my F drive.

- [00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=180) So I opened a new cmd window here, git clone and this is the URL.

- [00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=186) It is cloned.

- [00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=187) This is installation on computer.

- [00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=189) You see, now we have our cloned folder here.

- [00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=192) All you need to do is find setup.bat file, double click it.

- [00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=197) It will compose a new virtual environment so it won't affect your other installations

- [00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=202) such as Stable Diffusion or other installation.

- [00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=205) Ignore this message.

- [00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=206) Wait until you get this screen, then select option 1, hit enter, select option 2.

- [00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=213) Now we are using Torch version 2.

- [00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=215) This is really important using Torch version 2.

- [00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=218) Now here, you won't see the progress, but you will see whenever the currently installing

- [00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=225) package has been completed.

- [00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=227) So you need to wait patiently.

- [00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=230) This process may take a lot of time depending on your internet speed.

- [00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=235) Currently my internet speed is 100 megabits per second.

- [00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=239) So you see it is downloading the necessary files.

- [00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=242) Just patiently wait.

- [00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=244) The installation is continuing.

- [00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=245) You will see the messages as it progress like this.

- [00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=248) Once all of the requirements have been installed, you will be asked several options as you are

- [00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=254) seeing right now.

- [00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=255) Select this machine, select no distributed training, select no for this option.

- [00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=260) Do you want to run your training on CPU only?

- [00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=263) Do you wish to optimize your script with Torch dynamo?

- [00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=265) This is not available for Windows yet.

- [00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=268) So select no.

- [00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=269) Do you want to use deep speed?

- [00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=271) Select no.

- [00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=272) And what GPU do you want to use?

- [00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=273) We will select all.

- [00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=275) And select BF16 here if you have RTX 2000, 3000 or 4000 series.

- [00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=281) If you have RTX 1000 series or below, select FP16.

- [00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=285) So I will select BF16.

- [00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=287) You will see other several options here.

- [00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=289) Install bitsandbytes-windows or manually configure accelerate.

- [00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=292) You don't need to do them.

- [00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=294) Then our installation has been completed.

- [00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=296) Just close this cmd window.

- [00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=299) After installation has been completed, all you need to do is double clicking gui.bat

- [00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=303) file and it will start Kohya GUI as you are seeing right now.

- [00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=306) It will install necessary requirements if there are any missing ones and it has started.

- [00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=312) So we need to open this URL, copy it and paste it into your browser like this.

- [00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=318) So this is the Kohya GUI screen.

- [00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=320) In this tutorial, I will show how to do training on SDXL.

- [00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=324) Between SDXL and SD 1.5 version, only parameters changes.

- [00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=330) However, the rest of usage is same.

- [00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=333) So let's begin.

- [00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=334) So first we will begin with selecting our model.

- [00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=336) Click here, select custom.

- [00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=338) We need to select the model.

- [00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=339) When you click here, it will allow you to select model.

- [00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=343) My model is already downloaded in here.

- [00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=346) SDXL base 0.9 version like this.

- [00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=349) This is SDXL model, so I am selecting this option.

- [00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=353) If you don't know where to download or how to download SDXL base version, this is the

- [00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=358) link of it.

- [00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=359) When you open this link, you need to have Hugging Face account logged in and it will

- [00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=365) ask you to accept research agreement.

- [00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=367) Just fill it and accept it.

- [00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=369) With more details, I have explained this process in ComfyUI for SDXL tutorial, so you should

- [00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=375) watch it as well.

- [00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=376) Okay, we did set our base training model.

- [00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=379) Then we will go to tools and prepare our training data set.

- [00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=383) There is deprecated tab here.

- [00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=386) This is the tab where we will prepare our training folders.

- [00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=390) The instance prompt will be ohwx.

- [00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=392) The class prompt will be man.

- [00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=394) Then I need to set my training images.

- [00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=397) I have prepared my training images like this.

- [00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=399) Each one of them is 1024 pixels and 1024 pixels.

- [00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=404) This is not a very good training images data set.

- [00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=407) Why?

- [00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=408) I have repeating backgrounds, I have repeating clothing, therefore this is not optimal.

- [00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=413) But for now, I will use this and hopefully I am planning to make a tutorial for a very

- [00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=419) good training data set preparation.

- [00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=421) So I will copy the path from here, paste it here.

- [00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=424) Now repeating parameter.

- [00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=426) This parameter is not very well known.

- [00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=429) I have asked this to the developer of Kohya to explain in more details.

- [00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=435) However, I still didn't get an answer.

- [00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=437) From my understanding that it will do 20 times training of each training images in 1 epoch

- [00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=447) with each time training with another 1 single class image.

- [00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=451) It is really hard to explain with this way.

- [00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=454) This is much more simpler and easier with the DreamBoothh extension of Automatic1111

- [00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=458) web UI.

- [00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=459) But for now, I will use this as 20.

- [00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=462) Then we will set our classification / regularization images.

- [00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=465) I have got an amazing classification images directory.

- [00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=469) This is prepared from Unsplash.

- [00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=471) How I have prepared these classification images?

- [00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=476) I shared that on this YouTube tutorial video.

- [00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=479) I also shared these classification images in this Patreon post.

- [00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=483) This Patreon post contains all of these ratios previously prepared classification images

- [00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=489) for you.

- [00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=490) So let's copy its path.

- [00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=492) This classification / regularization images will significantly improve our realism.

- [00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=498) Because with these images, we will further fine-tune the Stable Diffusion X-Large model.

- [00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=504) However, you don't have to use these images.

- [00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=506) You can use ComfyUI, generate photo of man classification images and use them if you

- [00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=511) wish.

- [00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=512) Destination training directory.

- [00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=513) This is important.

- [00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=514) This is where all of the training files, LoRA outputs will be saved.

- [00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=519) So click this icon, select the folder where you want your training to be saved.

- [00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=523) I will make a new folder, Kohya SDXL tutorial files, and I will open this folder and select

- [00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=531) it.

- [00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=532) You see now it is written here.

- [00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=534) Now click preparing data.

- [00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=535) When I click this what will happen?

- [00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=537) First of all, every time whenever you do something, you need to look to CMD window and see what

- [00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=543) is happening.

- [00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=544) You see it has copied my training images into this folder.

- [00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=548) It has copied my classification images into this folder and everything is set.

- [00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=553) So it is inside F drive, inside my new folder.

- [00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=557) So this is the folder structure.

- [00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=559) Inside img you will see a folder named like this.

- [00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=562) This naming is extremely important.

- [00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=565) Without this naming convention, Kohya script will not work.

- [00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=569) Okay, this is really important.

- [00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=571) And also in reg folder, we have regularization images like this.

- [00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=574) You may be wondering what is this ohwx instance prompt?

- [00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=578) What is this class prompt?

- [00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=580) I am agree with you.

- [00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=582) These are like alien terms if you are not familiar with this training.

- [00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=586) If you want to learn more about this rare token, classification images, I have an amazing

- [00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=591) tutorial.

- [00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=592) This is a master tutorial.

- [00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=593) It is 100 minutes long.

- [00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=595) Watch this tutorial.

- [00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=596) It also has chapters and English subtitles manually fixed by me.

- [00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=600) Some people also asking me why you are using real images as regularization images.

- [00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=606) Because if you are aiming realism, then using real images will make your model even further

- [00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=612) realistic.

- [00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=613) As long as the images you use for classification are better than the model itself.

- [00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=619) Since these are very high quality real images, it will further fine tune SDXL for realism

- [00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=626) and it will improve my realism training.

- [00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=629) However, if you want to do training with the style of the base model, then you should use

- [00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=633) the images generated from the model itself.

- [00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=635) Okay, finally, don't forget copy info to folders tab because when we go back to training tab

- [00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=642) and when we go to the folders tab, we will see all of the parameters like this.

- [00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=647) Model output name.

- [00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=648) Now this is important.

- [00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=650) Whatever the name you give will be used when saving the checkpoints of LoRA training.

- [00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=655) So I will name this as tutorial_video.

- [00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=659) So this will be our output name of Kohya generated LoRA checkpoints.

- [00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=664) Then the most important part parameters.

- [00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=666) I have done over 15 trainings to find optimal parameters for SDXL.

- [00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=673) Let me show you some of the tests that I have made until finding some optimal parameters.

- [00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=678) I have done so many tests and each one of them is taking huge time as you can imagine.

- [00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=684) So finding optimal parameters with Kohya LoRA is extremely hard.

- [00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=688) There are so many conflicting information on the internet.

- [00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=691) There isn't any proper information.

- [00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=694) So with SDXL, you have to do a lot of research.

- [00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=697) There are some presets for SDXL, but they weren't any good.

- [00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=701) So I am not going to use any preset.

- [00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=704) Select LoRA type Standard.

- [00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=706) Do not change anything in these two sections.

- [00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=709) Train batch size 1.

- [00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=710) Now this is very important.

- [00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=712) If you are teaching a subject using the minimum training batch size is better.

- [00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=717) Because as you increase your training batch size, the generalization of the model will

- [00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=721) decrease.

- [00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=722) So when you need to use batch size?

- [00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=723) You need to use training batch size if you have too many images to train.

- [00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=728) If you are doing an overall fine tuning of a model.

- [00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=730) Like let's say you have 100,000 images to train, then you have to increase your batch

- [00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=736) size because otherwise it will take forever to train.

- [00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=739) Number of epochs.

- [00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=740) Now this is important.

- [00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=741) Since we did set number of repeatings to 20.

- [00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=744) Actually our 1 epoch will be equal to 20 epochs.

- [00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=749) Because in each epoch, 20 times each one of the training images will be trained.

- [00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=755) Therefore, I will do training up to 10 epochs.

- [00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=759) With this way, we will have checkpoint with every 20 epochs.

- [00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=764) Like I am showing in Automatic1111 web UI DreamBooth training.

- [00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=768) So we will save every 1 epoch a checkpoint.

- [00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=771) Select mixed precision BF16.

- [00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=773) Select BF16.

- [00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=774) If you get error, if you have older card that doesn't support BF16, then use FP16.

- [00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=779) Number of CPU threads per core.

- [00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=781) This is two.

- [00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=783) I don't change it.

- [00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=785) Cache latents.

- [00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=786) This will improve your training speed.

- [00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=787) Cache latents to disk.

- [00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=788) This will also improve your training speed.

- [00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=790) Now learning rate.

- [00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=791) I have tested so many learning rates and for SDXL with standard LoRA type, the learning

- [00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=798) rate I found best is 4e-4.

- [00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=801) So this is equal to this one.

- [00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=804) You see 0.0004.

- [00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=806) Optimizer.

- [00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=807) This is really important.

- [00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=808) With SDXL, we are using Adafactor optimizer.

- [00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=813) These optimizers are explained in this Hugging Face page.

- [00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=817) You see AdamW and there is Adafactor.

- [00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=820) So Adafactor uses much lesser VRAM.

- [00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=823) I think this is the least VRAM using optimizer algorithm.

- [00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=827) You can read this page and learn more if you wish.

- [00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=830) Okay, so optimizer is Adafactor.

- [00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=833) Actually, I just checked again and verified that my learning rate scheduler is constant

- [00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=839) and learning rate warmup steps is 0.

- [00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=841) So don't forget this.

- [00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=842) Learning rate scheduler constant.

- [00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=844) Learning rate warmup steps 0.

- [00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=846) Optimizer extra arguments.

- [00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=848) Now for SDXL, we need to use optimizer extra arguments.

- [00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=853) I have shared the optimizer extra arguments in our GitHub readme file.

- [00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=858) Copy them.

- [00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=859) Paste them here.

- [00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=860) So these are optimizer extra arguments.

- [00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=861) Max resolution.

- [00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=862) This is really important.

- [00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=864) You need to make this 1024 and 1024.

- [00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=868) Also, I set learning rate equal in Text Encoder learning rate and UNET learning rate as well.

- [00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=874) So all of these learning rates are same as you are seeing right now.

- [00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=878) Do not check this box.

- [00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=879) I think when you check this box, it will not work.

- [00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=882) Because in my experimentation, it wasn't working.

- [00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=885) Check no half VAE for SDXL.

- [00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=887) Network rank dimension.

- [00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=890) Now some people are wondering what is this network rank dimension.

- [00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=894) LoRA training is actually DreamBooth training, but the difference is that we are not training

- [00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=900) the entire model itself.

- [00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=902) We are training only some part of the model.

- [00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=905) As you increase this network rank, you are training more part of the model.

- [00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=910) Thus, you are able to learn more information, more details.

- [00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=915) However, as you increase this network rank, it will use more VRAM and the checkpoint files

- [00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=922) will have bigger size in your disk.

- [00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=925) So this is the trade-off of network rank.

- [00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=927) I am using 256 network rank for realism.

- [00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=931) Network alpha.

- [00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=932) There isn't very clear information regarding this, but as you increase this during the

- [00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=937) training, the weight changes are stronger.

- [00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=942) So as you increase this, actually it is amplifying the learning rate and this network alpha changes

- [00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=948) according to the LoRA type that you are using.

- [00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=951) For standard LoRA type, use network alpha 1 with these learning rates.

- [00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=956) Do not increase it.

- [00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=957) I have tested it.

- [00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=958) If you increase it, it will get over-trained very quickly.

- [00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=962) So network alpha is 1.

- [00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=964) Network alpha will not change the size of your checkpoints.

- [00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=969) It is just a parameter that is used during training when applying and changing the weights.

- [00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=975) So these are all the parameters.

- [00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=977) Before starting training, you should save your configuration.

- [00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=980) How?

- [00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=981) Click save as.

- [00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=983) Select the folder where you want to save.

- [00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=985) Currently, this is the last folder.

- [00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=986) I will save it as test video now.

- [00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=989) I will save it as test video.

- [00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=990) Save.

- [00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=991) You see, this is the file.

- [00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=993) And whenever you click save, now all of the configuration will be saved here.

- [00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=997) After that, you can open and load and all of the settings you have will be loaded.

- [00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1002) When you also open cmd window, you will see save as command and save commands here as

- [00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1006) well.

- [00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1007) So before doing training, you can click print training command.

- [00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1010) This is very useful because it will show you how many number of images are found in your

- [00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1016) set folders like this, how many steps they will get.

- [00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1020) All of the information, all of the commands will be printed here.

- [00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1023) I will also copy this command and then hit train model.

- [00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1027) Then it will execute this command.

- [00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1029) You will also get that a matching Triton is not available.

- [00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1033) Some optimizations will not be enabled.

- [00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1035) This Triton library is not available on Windows yet.

- [00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1040) Therefore, you will also get this message if you are on Windows.

- [00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1044) On Linux, it is working.

- [00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1045) Also, you will see using DreamBooth method.

- [00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1047) Why?

- [00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1048) Because LoRA is also DreamBooth, but this is optimized version of DreamBooth training.

- [00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1053) Therefore, it is using lesser resources and trade off is lesser quality.

- [00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1058) So it is going to start training.

- [00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1059) Let me zoom in a little bit more.

- [00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1061) Okay, it is loading checkpoint, using xFormers, caching images.

- [00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1066) Since we have selected cache images in the disk as well, this caching is taking some

- [00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1071) time.

- [00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1072) A little bit increased VRAM usage at the moment.

- [00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1075) And meanwhile, I am recording a video.

- [00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1077) Since I am recording a video at the same time, my VRAM usage is higher than normal and GPU

- [00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1083) usage is higher than normal.

- [00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1085) I did get out of VRAM error because I didn't enable gradient checkpointing and looks like

- [00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1091) even 24 GB VRAM is not sufficient without gradient checkpointing.

- [00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1096) So after making this change, I click save.

- [00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1100) So the settings are saved.

- [00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1101) This is the current VRAM usage 1.2 GB.

- [00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1105) Let's do the training again.

- [00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1107) You don't need to do anything else.

- [00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1108) Just go to the bottom and click train model again.

- [00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1111) And it will start training again.

- [00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1113) And let's see the VRAM usage this time.

- [00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1115) I think even when I am recording video now, it should work.

- [00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1119) I also closed some of the applications that were open.

- [00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1120) Okay, you see this is the VRAM usage this time.

- [00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1125) So from 1.2 GB to 19.1 GB, 20.7 GB.

- [00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1132) Currently, it is using about 19 GB VRAM.

- [00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1136) The training has started.

- [00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1138) So the training speed is 1.5 seconds per it right now.

- [00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1142) It means iteration and in each iteration, it will train the number of images that you

- [00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1149) did set in your training batch size.

- [00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1151) So if my training batch size were 10, it would be training 10 images in each iteration.

- [00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1158) But since it is 1, it is processing 1 image in 1.5 seconds right now.

- [00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1164) And how many iteration it needs?

- [00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1165) It needs 5200 iterations to be completed.

- [00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1170) Why?

- [00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1171) Because we are doing 10 epoch, we have 13 images, we are using classification images.

- [00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1176) And when we do the calculation, it will be like this: 13 base training images multiplied

- [00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1182) with 2.

- [00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1183) Because we are using classification images.

- [00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1184) Multiplied with 10.

- [00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1186) Because we are doing 10 epoch.

- [00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1188) Multiplied with 20.

- [00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1189) Because we have 20 repeating.

- [00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1191) Therefore, the total number of steps is 5200.

- [00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1195) This calculation is also printed on the beginning when you hit the print training command.

- [00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1202) As you see, it is showing you the calculation of number of total steps.

- [00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1206) If my batch size were 13 how many steps / iteration would it take?

- [00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1211) We will just divide it to 13.

- [00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1214) And it will take only 400 steps.

- [00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1217) Because in each step in each iteration, it would be processing 13 images instead of 1

- [00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1223) image.

- [00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1224) With these settings, the training is taking about 100 minutes on my computer.

- [00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1228) I already done it.

- [00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1229) So I will now open it.

- [00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1231) But before doing that, I will show you one another very cool trick.

- [00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1235) I shared my user training command in here, copy it, open notepad++ or any notepad editor,

- [00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1242) paste it, and you will see all of my training commands here.

- [00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1246) You can change the folder names according to yours.

- [00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1249) And then you can copy this command.

- [00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1252) And how are you going to execute it?

- [00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1254) Enter inside your Kohya installation, enter inside virtual environment, enter inside scripts,

- [00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1259) open a new CMD, then type activate when you're inside scripts, then move back to the main

- [00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1266) Kohya folder like this, and copy paste the command and hit enter.

- [00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1271) This will be exactly same as training from the GUI.

- [00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1276) So it will start training from here with the same settings that we used in the GUI.

- [00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1282) So you can also follow this strategy if you wish.

- [00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1286) This will also work.

- [00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1288) In here, you will also see all of the settings that is used in my training.

- [00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1293) This is extremely convenient to check out and use.

- [00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1296) You'll see it is starting the training exactly as it was in the GUI version.

- [00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1301) So now I will open my Comfy UI to start using the LoRAs.

- [00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1306) Okay, it is started.

- [00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1308) You need to have workflows to start using SDXL with Comfy UI.

- [00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1313) Everything you need with Comfy UI is explained in this tutorial video.

- [00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1318) It is recorded but not posted on the YouTube yet.

- [00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1320) When I click here, I will get to the GitHub readme file that I have prepared for it.

- [00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1326) And in here we have the workflows.

- [00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1329) I will start with SDXL with LoRA workflows.

- [00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1332) Save link as.

- [00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1333) By the way, I have explained everything in the upcoming video.

- [00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1338) So you should watch it before watching this one.

- [00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1340) Let's download the PNG file into our folder as base, open it like this, then return back

- [00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1348) to our ComfyUI and drag and drop.

- [00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1351) And the workflow is loaded with SDXL base.

- [00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1354) Here my LoRAs.

- [00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1356) Test9 LoRA is the LoRA that I generated with the same settings that I just shown you.

- [00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1364) So you see I have several checkpoints.

- [00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1367) And now I need to test checkpoints.

- [00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1369) By the way, in the test9, I had user 25 repeating, not 20.

- [00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1374) So I have two lesser checkpoints with 8 epochs, but it doesn't matter much.

- [00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1379) So first of all, you need to test different checkpoints to find the best output.

- [00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1385) And how are you going to do that?

- [00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1387) Define your prompt.

- [00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1388) So I have shared the prompt in the GitHub readme file.

- [00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1392) Copy the positive prompt.

- [00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1394) This is a prompt that I did come up with like this.

- [00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1397) Then copy the negative prompt from here and paste it here.

- [00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1402) This is for generating your image in a suit in a very realistic way.

- [00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1408) Of course, I can't say this is the best way.

- [00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1410) But this is a decent way.

- [00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1412) Then we will test each one of the checkpoints.

- [00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1415) Before doing this test, let's make this as fixed seed.

- [00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1420) Let's make the batch size 6.

- [00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1422) I think I can even do 6 batch size, then give a file name prefix.

- [00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1427) Let's say tutorial video.

- [00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1429) Okay.

- [00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1430) Actually, if I want to see them with the file, and if I begin from the test9, the first checkpoint

- [00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1439) like this.

- [00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1440) I can give it as a name tutorial video 1.

- [00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1443) So I will know this is the first checkpoint of testing.

- [00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1447) Okay, fixed seed.

- [00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1449) These are the parameters.

- [00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1451) Everything you see here, explained in the other video, and it will be published when

- [00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1455) you are watching this video.

- [00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1457) Okay, we are ready and just hit queue.

- [00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1460) So it will start processing images, generating the images of training with the first checkpoint.

- [00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1466) Then let's pick the second checkpoint like this.

- [00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1469) The first checkpoint was actually being 25 epoch because repeating was 25.

- [00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1474) Okay, this one will be tutorial video 2.

- [00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1477) Queue.

- [00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1478) This is the second checkpoint.

- [00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1479) Now it will generate the second checkpoint.

- [00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1481) And let's see the third checkpoint.

- [00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1483) Let's name it as like this.

- [00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1485) Queue.

- [00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1486) Okay, the fourth checkpoint.

- [00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1488) This is much easier in Auto1111 web UI.

- [00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1491) However, in Comfy UI, I couldn't find any better way.

- [00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1495) I asked also the Comfy UI developers and there weren't any x/y/z checkpoint comparison.

- [00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1500) So the fifth checkpoint, let's make this as fifth.

- [00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1503) Queue, and then the sixth checkpoint.

- [00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1506) Let's.

- [00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1507) Oh, by the way, we didn't make the previous one.

- [00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1511) Yeah, let's let's delete the previous queue.

- [00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1513) So in the view queue, delete the last queue, let's go return back to five.

- [00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1518) Let's make this five.

- [00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1520) Add queue, then select the checkpoint six.

- [00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1523) Let's make prefix as six, hit queue, then let's select seven, make the prefix as seven.

- [00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1530) Hit queue.

- [00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1531) And the last one you see, like this.

- [00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1534) It is the final checkpoint after the training has been completed.

- [00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1538) And let's make it as 8.

- [00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1541) So this is actually being the eight epoch and repeating was 25.

- [00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1545) So this is being equal to 200 epochs in Auto1111 training and hit queue.

- [00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1551) Now I just need to wait patiently.

- [00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1553) Let's look at the results.

- [00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1554) So the results will be saved inside ComfyUI, inside output.

- [00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1560) These are all of the images that I generated yesterday.

- [00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1562) I will also show you them.

- [00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1565) Let's sort by date modified.

- [00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1567) Okay, we start seeing them here.

- [00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1570) Tutorial video 1.

- [00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1572) This is the first checkpoint generated images.

- [00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1574) So the checkpoints images are generated.

- [00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1577) It is now time to compare them and find the best looking checkpoint.

- [00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1582) This part is totally subjective and totally depends on you.

- [00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1586) You have to compare each checkpoint and find the best looking picture.

- [00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1590) Unfortunately, this is not as easy as using Automatic1111 web UI X/Y/Z checkpoint comparison.

- [00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1596) But this is what we got right now.

- [00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1600) So you need to look for each one of the checkpoint and decide which one is looking like best.

- [00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1607) Even the last checkpoint is not over trained.

- [00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1609) I can see that.

- [00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1610) So look for each checkpoint and decide which one is looking like best.

- [00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1616) After looking each checkpoint, I think the checkpoint 6 is looking very well.

- [00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1622) I will go with this one checkpoint 6.

- [00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1624) So now what we are going to do is we will select our best checkpoint from here.

- [00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1629) We will decide our prompts and generate hundreds of images to find the best ones.

- [00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1635) How we are going to do that?

- [00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1637) You see: I have selected my checkpoint checkpoint 6, then click extra options, increase batch

- [00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1644) count.

- [00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1645) Let's generate 100 white suits.

- [00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1646) Queue prompt.

- [00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1648) Then let's generate 100 blue suits.

- [00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1650) After you see the queue size reaches 100 wait to it and then hit queue prompt and 100 blue

- [00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1658) suit prompt is also queued and add to the queue the prompts that you like that you want

- [00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1665) to generate.

- [00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1666) After all images are generated what you are going to do is extremely important.

- [00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1671) You can look all of the images and find the good ones.

- [00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1676) However, this is very tiresome.

- [00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1678) This is very hard to do.

- [00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1681) So what else you can do?

- [00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1683) I have an amazing tutorial how to find best Stable Diffusion generated images by using

- [00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1688) deepface AI.

- [00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1689) This is the tutorial link.

- [00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1691) The used script is shown in the video.

- [00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1694) I also shared the script in this Patreon post.

- [00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1697) So go to this Patreon post, download the findbestimages.py file.

- [00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1702) So the file is here.

- [00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1704) Copy all of the generated images, put them into any folder.

- [00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1708) Sorted images tutorial like this.

- [00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1710) Paste it there.

- [00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1711) Okay, all images are here.

- [00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1713) They are not sorted with the similarity.

- [00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1716) Then go to your training images data set and select one image that you would like them

- [00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1722) to be sorted.

- [00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1723) The full logic of this script is explained in this video.

- [00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1728) So I will make two sorting.

- [00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1730) The first one will be according to the similarity of this picture.

- [00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1736) I copy this picture, then let's name it as org image 1.

- [00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1740) Okay, this will be the folder.

- [00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1743) Copy its path, edit the findBestImages.py file.

- [00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1747) So I will make the original image to be compared like this.

- [00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1751) Give the path of sorted images like here and give any name for detected images.

- [00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1756) Then open command line, type python findBestImages.py file.

- [00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1762) It will sort all of the images according to the picture you picked.

- [00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1767) Let's see the sorting progress.

- [00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1769) For this to work all you need is python installation and several other dependencies.

- [00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1774) Everything is explained in this video.

- [00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1778) It is so simple.

- [00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1779) You see currently it is calculating the similarity between this picture and the pictures that

- [00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1785) I am using here.

- [00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1787) So what will this script will do is: it will sort the images according to the similarity.

- [00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1792) Therefore, it will be very easy for me to compare them and find the best looking ones.

- [00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1798) I already have sorted images according to the two different images.

- [00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1802) One with this image and one with this image.

- [00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1805) So let's see first the images that is similar to this one.

- [00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1809) The sorted images are here.

- [00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1811) So these images are sorted according to the similarity of this image.

- [00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1816) So you see the similarities above 85% up to 90%.

- [00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1821) Not all images will be perfect.

- [00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1823) Because the script is not able to consider the beauty of the eyes, but it looks for overall

- [00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1828) general similarity.

- [00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1830) For example, this one.

- [00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1831) This one is a very decent image.

- [00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1833) Okay now let me show you some examples.

- [00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1835) On the left: our real image, real training image on the right, our raw image as you are

- [00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1839) seeing.

- [00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1840) Here, another one.

- [00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1842) Okay here another image according to the similarity, it is really really good.

- [00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1846) And this is with SDXL 0.9 version, not even the official 1.0 version release.

- [00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1852) We are not using the refiner.

- [00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1854) I am pretty sure there will be also refiner training and we will get amazing quality with

- [00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1860) SDXL.

- [00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1861) I am pretty sure of it.

- [00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1862) Let me also show you the other sorted images folder.

- [00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1866) So with my script it will be very easy for you to find the good looking images without

- [00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1872) looking through thousands of images.

- [00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1874) It will help you tremendously.

- [00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1876) So this one you see I am looking at this side.

- [00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1879) Why?

- [00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1880) Because when sorting them I used this training image, you see I am looking to the side direction.

- [00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1886) Therefore now I am finding all of the images that I am looking for the same direction.

- [00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1892) The quality is really really good.

- [00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1895) It is finding the images really really well.

- [00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1898) They can be further improved with inpainting.

- [00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1901) I will also show that.

- [00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1903) So if you have a specific pose, you can use that specific pose to sort the images and

- [00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1910) find specific pose having images.

- [00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1912) For example, this one really good one or this one.

- [00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1916) And how you can further improve the quality and the similarity.

- [00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1920) For example, let's take this picture and inpaint it.

- [00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1924) For inpainting I will refer to this tutorial.

- [00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1927) I have the inpainting workflow here.

- [00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1929) Right click SDXL LoRA inpaint.

- [00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1931) Save link as download anywhere you wish.

- [00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1934) Open folder, then go to Comfy UI.

- [00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1937) Load the inpainting like this.

- [00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1939) Also, let's open the sorted image so we will have the seed value and the prompt.

- [00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1944) So this is the prompt.

- [00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1945) Okay I copy paste the prompt.

- [00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1947) Let's also find the seed value.

- [00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1949) It is here.

- [00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1950) This is the seed value.

- [00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1952) I copy paste the seed value and I also need to select this safetensors file.

- [00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1957) So the safetensors file was 9.

- [00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1960) So this is the safetensors file.

- [00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1962) Test9, sixth epoch.

- [00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1964) Okay I have it.

- [00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1966) Let's make the batch size 1.

- [00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1967) We also need to choose upload inpainting file.

- [00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1970) So let's copy this file into here.

- [00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1973) It will be easier to find.

- [00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1975) Choose upload.

- [00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1976) Let's go here.

- [00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1977) This is the file I have right, click and here go to the open in mask editor, change the

- [00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1984) thickness and select the face.

- [00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1985) Like this.

- [00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1987) This is not as easy as using in Auto1111 unfortunately.

- [00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1990) This.

- [00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1991) Okay save to node.

- [00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1992) Okay, grow mask by 64 pixels.

- [00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1996) The denoise is 80%.

- [00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=1999) Okay, let's add to the queue.

- [00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=2001) By the way, this mask may not be very well so let's see the result.

- [00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=2006) You need to play with denoise strength and mask to get good results, the better results.

- [00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=2011) We will see the generated image here in a moment.

- [00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=2014) Okay with inpainting currently 1.6 it per second.

- [00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=2018) I think Auto1111 will be much faster than this.

- [00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=2022) And we have inpainted image.

- [00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=2024) It is named as base output.

- [00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=2026) Let's save the image.

- [00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=2027) Okay it is saved.

- [00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=2029) And here in painted image this was the original image.

- [00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=2032) This is the inpainted image.

- [00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=2034) Of course we need to do more inpainting to get better result.

- [00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=2037) But I already see some serious improvements.

- [00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=2041) Maybe the.

- [00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=2042) Yeah since we have made the mask bigger I think it increased the face size so it may

- [00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=2049) not look very natural.

- [00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=2051) But this is the strategy of obtaining very high quality images with inpainting of SDXL.

- [00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=2058) So what if if you don't have 24GB GPU.

- [00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=2061) You have 8 GB.

- [00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=2063) You can do the training on RunPod.

- [00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=2065) I already have tutorial for how to install and use on RunPod.

- [00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=2069) I already have automatic installer script for RunPod.

- [00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=2073) Do the training on RunPod.

- [00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=2076) Everything is same.

- [00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=2077) Watch this video.

- [00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=2078) You will learn.

- [00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=2079) Then download the generated checkpoints and use your own computer.

- [00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=2082) What if if you don't even have any gpu, you can use RunPod both for ComfyUI and for training.

- [00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=2091) Also in my referred tutorial I show how to use ComfyUI on Google Colab free account as

- [00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=2096) well.

- [00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=2097) So it will be very easy for you to use.

- [00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=2100) Just watch the other tutorial that will be linked here when you are watching and then

- [00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=2105) watch this tutorial and it will help you tremendously.

- [00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=2107) So we got amazing realistic quality.

- [00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=2111) But what about styling?

- [00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=2115) Realism and styling are actually conflicting because for realism you need to have more

- [00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=2119) details.

- [00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=2120) That means that it is lesser generalized model.

- [00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=2124) However, let's try this.

- [00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=2125) Portrait photo of ohwx man in gta 5 style.

- [00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=2130) Let's queue prompt.

- [00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=2131) Let's drag and drop the image output here so we can test it.

- [00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=2135) Currently it is going to generate 2 images.

- [00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=2137) We can see the progress here.

- [00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=2139) It is still loading.

- [00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=2140) Yes, the model is loaded.

- [00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=2142) It is generating 2 images with 1.15 second per it.

- [00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=2146) By the way, these are not the best it per second because I am recording video.

- [00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=2150) Moreover, I think there will be more optimizations soon.

- [00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=2154) Okay, we got the result.

- [00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=2157) You see it is still not good enough stylized.

- [00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=2160) So what you need to do is reduce the strength of the ohwx token.

- [00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=2166) So let's try like this with 90 percent strength instead of 100 percent for this ohwx token.

- [00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=2173) And here the results.

- [00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=2174) We can see that it is starting to look more like the GTA5 as you are seeing right now.

- [00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=2181) When I double click on the images it shows them.

- [00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=2185) You see it is becoming more like GTA5 style.

- [00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=2187) We can add more prompts like a game character like this, perhaps digital drawing, digital

- [00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=2195) artwork.

- [00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=2197) You see, you know when you add more prompts it will become more like that.

- [00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=2201) Let's try like this, but certainly there is some stylizing as a GTA5.

- [00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=2206) Okay, now we are more like a game character.

- [00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=2209) A digital drawing.

- [00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=2211) You see.

- [00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=2212) Let's reduce the strength of the ohwx token and try one more time.

- [00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=2217) But certainly we are getting closer to a game character style as you are seeing right now.

- [00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=2223) It is still perfectly keeping my face.

- [00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=2226) This is a thing that I have discovered while doing experimentation.

- [00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=2230) There will be whole new area of SDXL prompting because it is different than SD 1.5 version.

- [00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=2237) That is for sure.

- [00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=2239) We need to figure out how to do prompting.

- [00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=2242) And here now we are seeing almost completely as a GTA5 character based on my picture.

- [00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=2249) This is another one.

- [00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=2250) This is not as much as stylized like that, but this one is certainly.

- [00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=2254) So this is the way of getting stylized images.

- [00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=2258) If your image is too realistic, reduce the weight here and hopefully I will make a new

- [00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=2263) tutorial for how to get amazing stylized images.

- [00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=2267) It requires different workflow that is for sure.

- [00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=2271) I have got some other previous testing as well.

- [00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=2274) You see this is another stylized image.

- [00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=2276) Let's load also this one to see the prompt.

- [00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=2279) Photo of ohwx man as a pixar character.

- [00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=2282) This was using my previous safetensors file with strength of the LoRA model reduced.

- [00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=2289) So I will copy this prompt.

- [00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=2292) So I will open another tab here.

- [00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=2295) Okay, load the latest generated image, copy the prompt like this, copy the negatives like

- [00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=2301) this and try again with our best checkpoint.

- [00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=2304) Then I will reduce the token strength to see.

- [00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=2308) Okay, here we got the result.

- [00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=2310) Now let's reduce the weight of the token like this and try again.

- [00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=2315) Okay, now we got a very good stylized image with 90 percent strength.

- [00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=2320) You see it is completely stylized as Pixar as me and this is not a cherry pick.

- [00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=2326) This is the first try I did make so this is amazing.

- [00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=2330) I added these prompts to our readme file as well.

- [00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=2333) So as I said, this readme file will be your number one source for this tutorial.

- [00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=2338) You see the prompts are here.

- [00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=2340) This is all for today.

- [00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY6DMBCIZ3A&t=2342) I hope you have enjoyed.
