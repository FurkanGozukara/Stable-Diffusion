### Video Transcription


- [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=0) Greetings, everyone. In this video, I am going to&nbsp; show you how to one-click install Magic Animate,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=6) Temporarily Consistent Human Image&nbsp; Animation using Diffusion Model.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=10) You might have seen their demos online and&nbsp; couldn't make it install, so in this video,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=16) I will show you how to install and use it with&nbsp; plus features. So, with one-click installation,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=22) you will be able to run the demo. Moreover,&nbsp; with unchecking "Merge input image, video,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=28) and output into single video," you will be able&nbsp; to generate single videos like this. I am also&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=34) going to provide you DensePose generator from any&nbsp; video. What I mean is, turn your any video into&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=40) DensePose video as you are seeing right now with&nbsp; one-click installer and very easy process. I will&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=47) explain all of that. Moreover, by using DaVinci&nbsp; Resolve, I will show you how to crop properly,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=54) zoom in, and export any real video footage so&nbsp; that you can convert that real video footage&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=61) into DensePose video footage. Moreover, I am going&nbsp; to share with you one-click installer and a Gradio&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=67) application for CodeFormer face restore. This&nbsp; Gradio application is taking a video as input,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=74) and it is going to restore face as you are seeing&nbsp; right now with 2x video upscaling. Actually,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=80) it supports more upscaling as well, so both the&nbsp; video and the face will get improved by using&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=87) this amazing Gradio application. So, if you wanted&nbsp; to learn and test and see yourself Magic Animate,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=94) this is the video you are looking for. I will&nbsp; also show how to install on RunPod, both the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=100) Magic Animate, the CodeFormer, and DensePose Video&nbsp; Maker. So, if you are a Linux user or if you don't&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=107) have a strong GPU, strong computer, by following&nbsp; this tutorial, you will be able to use everything&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=114) and do everything on RunPod. If you are only&nbsp; interested in RunPod installation, you can look&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=120) at the video chapters and jump to that part, but&nbsp; I do not suggest it because I will be explaining&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=125) a lot of stuff in the first chapter as well. So,&nbsp; all of the instructions and scripts that you are&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=131) going to need to follow this tutorial is shared&nbsp; in this Patreon post. To follow this tutorial,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=137) you need to have Python installed, you need&nbsp; to have Visual C++ tools installed, and you&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=142) need to have FFmpeg installed. Just for showing&nbsp; how to install these, I have recorded an amazing&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=150) tutorial video. The link is here; you can also&nbsp; find this in the description of the video. So,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=155) in this tutorial video, I have shown how&nbsp; to install all of the necessary libraries&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=161) and the programs that you need. This is a very&nbsp; detailed tutorial. In the details of the video,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=167) you can see all of the chapters. So, if you need&nbsp; anything, just look at the chapter, find it,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=172) and install it. Once you have installed all of&nbsp; these, then all you need to do is download the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=178) latest Magic Animate version 4 zip file. This&nbsp; could get updated when you are watching this&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=183) video because whenever something gets broken, I&nbsp; update it. All of the instructions are also shared&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=190) in this post as text, so you don't need to watch&nbsp; this video entirely. Moreover, in the very bottom,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=196) you will see the attachment. I prefer download&nbsp; from attachments. Let's download it, move the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=201) attachment into a folder that you want to install.&nbsp; Let's install it into our G drive. So, let's make&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=208) Magic Video. When you are making folders, do&nbsp; not have any special characters or do not have&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=214) any space characters because some of the libraries&nbsp; are not working when you have space character. So,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=219) I will extract here. Everything is extracted.&nbsp; Let's delete this zip folder. So, you see, these&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=226) are the folder names. Let's begin with installing&nbsp; the Magic Animate. So, enter inside, compose Magic&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=232) Animate, click Install MagicAnimate.bat file. It&nbsp; will install everything fully automatically for&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=239) you. It will also download the necessary models&nbsp; into the accurate folders. And you see there is&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=244) also Install.sh file which is made for Linux&nbsp; users. We will use it to install automatically&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=251) on a RunPod machine. The RunPod tutorial will be&nbsp; in the second section of this video, so you can&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=257) look at the chapters and jump into that section&nbsp; if you are interested in, but watching the entire&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=262) tutorial is better because I will show many stuff&nbsp; here as well. Meanwhile installing, let me show&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=268) you my Python and my FFmpeg. So, I typed Python,&nbsp; and you see, this is my Python version. This&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=275) is the default Python in my system. Please use&nbsp; 3.10.6 or 8 or 9 or 11, but do not use 3.9 or do&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=285) not use 3.11 or do not use 3.12 because you will&nbsp; likely encounter problems. And when I type FFmpeg,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=293) you see FFmpeg is set on my system and ready to be&nbsp; used by any application, any library, or from the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=299) Python applications. So, the installation has been&nbsp; completed. It also downloaded all of the models,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=306) as you are seeing right now, into the&nbsp; accurate folders. Before proceeding,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=311) scroll to the up and check out whether there are&nbsp; any errors or any warnings or anything else. Be&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=318) sure that there are no errors so that you will be&nbsp; sure that everything is installed accurately. This&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=325) is also a very important part, as you are seeing&nbsp; right now; there are no errors in my installation.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=331) It is installing so many stuff, so I have worked&nbsp; a lot to make this installer for you. Then,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=337) press any key to close. Let's return back into our&nbsp; folder. Now we are ready to use the application.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=343) To use it, double-click Run GradioApp.bat file. It&nbsp; will automatically start the Compose Magic Animate&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=351) web UI for you, and this web UI is improved&nbsp; compared to the official released repository. The&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=359) web UI has started, as you are seeing right now.&nbsp; This is an improved version. Why? Because you see,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=364) we have "Merge input image, video, and plus output&nbsp; into a single video" option. So, let's use the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=372) demo example they put. You see motion sequence&nbsp; and the reference image. So, let's animate. When&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=378) you click animate, you will see it will start&nbsp; processing. Watch here. This duration, the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=385) processing speed totally depends on your duration&nbsp; of the input sequence video, the DensePose video,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=394) and also depends on your GPU. The longer your&nbsp; input DensePose video, it will take longer,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=400) even though it will display 25 steps here, so each&nbsp; step will become much longer. Moreover, how much&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=408) VRAM it is going to use totally depends on the&nbsp; duration of the DensePose video input. There is no&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=415) limit; you can even process 30 seconds video, one&nbsp; minute video. However, as you use longer video,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=420) it will use more VRAM and it will take more&nbsp; time. So, currently, while I am recording, it is&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=425) processing this short video this fast, as you are&nbsp; seeing right now. Okay, all merged into one video,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=431) and we got the output. Let's play it. So, this&nbsp; is the output of the video. So, what happens if&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=437) you uncheck this option? It will only give you the&nbsp; output video, nothing else. Moreover, you can use&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=443) our pre-shared DensePose videos. There are several&nbsp; DensePose videos here, as you are seeing. You can&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=448) use any of them, and you can use any image. The&nbsp; application requires 512 to 512, both image and&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=456) video input. So, as a next step, let's generate&nbsp; our own DensePose video from another video. This&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=464) is a frequently asked question. So, to be&nbsp; able to generate our own DensePose video,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=470) enter inside Compose DensePose, and in here,&nbsp; you need to double-click Install Detectron.bat&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=477) file. To be able to install Detectron, you need&nbsp; to have installed C++ tools. This is really,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=484) really important because it is going to compile&nbsp; some wheels. Also, this DensePose will make its&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=490) own virtual environment. All the scripts that I&nbsp; make and share on Patreon make their own virtual&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=497) environment, so they will not conflict with any&nbsp; other of your installations, such as Comfy UI,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=502) such as Automatic1111 Web UI. So, whichever the&nbsp; other AI applications that you use, they will&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=508) not get conflicted. So, the installation has been&nbsp; completed. Verify that you do not have any errors,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=515) and the most important part of this installation&nbsp; is where it builds the wheel of the Detectron.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=524) You see, it has built the Detectron wheel, and we&nbsp; have no errors. Everything is set up. Now, I will&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=531) find a demo video from Pexels to show you how to&nbsp; generate DensePose video. Let's say "man walking,"&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=539) and let's try this video, whether it will be&nbsp; good or not. Okay, let's free download. First,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=545) you should extract it with 512 to 512 resolution.&nbsp; So, for editing this video into 512 and 512 with&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=554) cropping, I will use DaVinci Resolve free-edition.&nbsp; Open it. If you don't know how to use DaVinci&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=559) Resolve edition, you can watch my amazing tutorial&nbsp; on our channel. Just type DaVinci Resolve. Okay,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=566) let's open a new project. Let's say create.&nbsp; It doesn't matter. Before importing video into&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=572) the timeline, go to settings here, and set it as&nbsp; 512, 512. Also, set the frame rate to 25 because&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=579) the Magic Animate works with 25. So, these are&nbsp; mandatory, and very importantly, in the image&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=586) scaling, change this mismatched resolution files&nbsp; to center crop with no resizing. Then, save. Then,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=593) go to the Edit tab. Go back to your downloads.&nbsp; So, I will import again. Don't change the frame&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=598) rate. Okay, this is important. Okay, now we are&nbsp; going to crop it as we want, so we will have the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=604) maximum quality of our video. Okay, let's make&nbsp; like this, maybe zoom out a little bit more,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=611) like this center. Okay, looking decent. You can&nbsp; zoom out and change the position as you wish&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=618) from these options. So how you made the video&nbsp; will affect your output. Let's make it like six&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=626) seconds. So for cutting it, you can use this icon&nbsp; and cut, then let's delete the selected part. Let&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=632) me show you. So, when you click this, it will cut&nbsp; where your cursor is set. Then let's right-click&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=638) and delete the selected. Then go to the export&nbsp; tab and let's export as example. Let's select&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=644) the format, MP4 H265. Resolution is 512, 512,&nbsp; frame rate is set. Okay, everything is looking&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=653) good. So select where you want to save. Let's&nbsp; save it inside Magic Video, Compose DensePose,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=660) Example.mp4. Okay, and render all. Since this&nbsp; is a small file, it will get rendered. Okay,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=666) now we are ready. We have done the installation&nbsp; of Compose DensePose. To run this, you need to&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=672) edit MakeDensePoseVideo.py file. Open it. So&nbsp; what you need to change is the video path. So,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=679) the video path is right now Example.mp4. Let's&nbsp; change it as Example.mp4. Then change your output,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=687) currently, it is like this. Let's make it as Magic&nbsp; Test. Okay, and you are ready. Then all you need&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=693) to do is double-click GenerateDenseVideo.bat file.&nbsp; It will extract the frames and process them. For&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=700) extracting, it is using FFmpeg, so FFmpeg is&nbsp; really mandatory for this tutorial or in many&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=708) other AI applications that you are going to use.&nbsp; And it is done. So you see, it has generated Dense&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=714) frames, and our Dense video is generated. Let's&nbsp; look at the Dense video, which is Magic Test.mp4.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=722) When I open it, you see this is a DensePose&nbsp; video of the input video. It also has some&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=729) minor noise unfortunately. When we enter inside&nbsp; the Dense frames, you see the noise are here. You&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=736) can manually edit them and fix them, like this.&nbsp; Save it, and it is fixed. Also, in here, I see,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=743) unfortunately, this is happening even though we&nbsp; are using the very best Detectron model available.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=749) This is a limitation of DensePose video. So you&nbsp; can fix all of the errors manually like this and&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=755) reconstruct the video. For reconstructing the&nbsp; video, you can use FFmpeg, or I made another&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=762) Reconstructor alone file. Now, I will show in&nbsp; a moment. Okay, I don't see any other erroneous&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=769) output. You see there is ReCompileDenseVideo.py&nbsp; file. Just fix the output name. So it will use&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=777) the DensePose input frames which we fixed. Double&nbsp; click ReCompileDenseVideo.bat file. It will ask&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=786) you to override. Click yes, and it will fix&nbsp; the Magic Test output, which is our output,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=792) and no more such noise here. Of course, there are&nbsp; still some other noises, but we can't do anything&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=798) with DensePose. This is what we got. Okay, now&nbsp; we can test the new video from here. So let's&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=804) go to Compose DensePose. Magic Test video is&nbsp; uploaded. This is the new one. And this time,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=811) I won't merge input image, video, output. Let's&nbsp; animate. Okay, we got an error, because. Because,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=817) I have to pick another image. We were using the&nbsp; reference image, so it wants me to upload again.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=824) So let's try this image, for example. Okay,&nbsp; let's animate, and now it started. The error&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=831) you just seen was because in the beginning, we had&nbsp; clicked here, therefore when we changed the video,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=838) it didn't see the image uploaded, so we had&nbsp; to re-upload the image. Now it is processing.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=844) You see, this time it is much slower because the&nbsp; DensePose motion sequence we uploaded is longer&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=851) than the previous one, so it will take longer. By&nbsp; the way, it will not try to replicate your input&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=857) image. It is recognizing it with Stable Diffusion&nbsp; terms, and it is generating the output based on&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=865) that recognition. Unfortunately, it will not try&nbsp; to match the face exactly, or the demos you've&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=872) seen, they will not be as good as those demos.&nbsp; All right, we got the output. Let's see. So,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=879) this is the output. You see, it is not looking&nbsp; very good. It's looking terrible, actually. So,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=885) it is totally depending on your input sequence.&nbsp; You need to find a good sequence input to get good&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=893) results. Unfortunately, there is no other way. It&nbsp; will not work good with every input. Now, I will&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=899) run this with one of the pre-shared demo sequences&nbsp; because they are working best, probably because of&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=905) the training dataset, they are over-trained. Okay,&nbsp; here, their pre-shared DensePose, I will try with&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=912) Running Two. It is also a five-second. You see,&nbsp; this is the running, they shared. Let's see the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=918) results. Okay, so we got the results. Let's check&nbsp; it out. It is much better, much better than our&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=924) used DensePose. Now, I will show you how to use&nbsp; CodeFormer to improve the face and upscale the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=932) video. You can use this CodeFormer on any video.&nbsp; If you need CodeFormer alone to use on videos,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=940) you can just use this part of the scripts. So, to&nbsp; use it, first, we will install. Double-click the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=948) Install CodeFormer.bat file. It will generate its&nbsp; own virtual environment and install the necessary&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=954) packages. The installation has been completed.&nbsp; Make sure that there are no errors, and right now,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=960) I am checking, and there are no errors. Okay,&nbsp; everything looks like installed. This is also&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=966) requiring a lot of libraries, unfortunately. All&nbsp; right, then we will run the app by double-clicking&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=973) this, and the app has started. Okay, I don't want&nbsp; to input my camera. This is weird; it shouldn't&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=981) ask for my camera, or because the camera option&nbsp; was selected. Wow, okay, let's say awllow. No,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=987) okay, let's go to here. I don't know why&nbsp; default it is trying to use this. It shouldn't,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=992) but it is trying. All right, then we will give&nbsp; our input video. So, let's download this video&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=1000) from here. The videos are also saved in a default&nbsp; folder where you might wonder, inside Compose&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=1007) Magic Animate, inside Demo, inside Outputs. You&nbsp; see all the videos are saved by default. Okay,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=1015) we downloaded the video. Let's upload it from&nbsp; here. So, this is our video. Now, there is&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=1021) one option that you can play with, balance the&nbsp; quality and fidelity. So, which side you want,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=1028) quality or fidelity. Let's go with the quality.&nbsp; Let's upscale into 2x. You can also upscale to&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=1036) more. I will just go with 2x and submit. So, what&nbsp; will this application do? It will download the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=1043) Real-ESRGAN upscaler, then it will download the&nbsp; CodeFormer. I have coded this myself, this Gradio,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=1050) and of course, all of the installation scripts.&nbsp; Then it is going to extract every frame of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=1056) input video. It will do upscale and face restore,&nbsp; then it will recombine the final video output for&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=1063) us. It's also pretty fast, as you are seeing&nbsp; right now. So, if you need this, then you can&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=1068) use this script alone. Okay, the output is&nbsp; ready. Now, I will run both of them at the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=1074) same time so you can see the quality improvement.&nbsp; The face improvement is significant. For example,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=1080) let's go to the same scene, almost the same&nbsp; scene, and let's see the difference. You see,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=1087) the face improvement is significant. However,&nbsp; since the input video is not that great,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=1092) we will not get a very consistent face, but still,&nbsp; we will get a much better face than before when&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=1099) you consider the face in the input video. So,&nbsp; CodeFormer face improvement will significantly&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=1106) improve depending on the input video you have. And&nbsp; the best part is, you can use this for any video&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=1114) that you have, not just for Magic Animate. If you&nbsp; have a low-resolution video, you can use this to&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=1119) upscale the video and improve the face because&nbsp; this is also doing a video upscale automatically&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=1125) for you. Okay, now I will show you how to install&nbsp; everything on RunPod. If you are a Linux user,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=1131) this is also how you are going to install. On our&nbsp; Patreon post, everything is step by step written.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=1138) So, let's go to our RunPod from this link. If&nbsp; you're another RunPod user, you can register from&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=1143) there. Let's go to the community cloud. Select&nbsp; extreme speed from here. I will use RTX 3090.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=1151) However, you can also go with higher VRAM having&nbsp; GPUs. With that way, you will be able to process&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=1157) longer videos with longer DensePose input. Let's&nbsp; deploy. You really need to follow the instructions&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=1164) here. Select the PyTorch template. So, let's&nbsp; type PyTorch, and let's select any of them,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=1169) for example, this one. Then customize and set the&nbsp; volume disk to 50 gigabytes. So, customize volume&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=1176) disk to 50 gigabytes. Override, continue, deploy.&nbsp; This should get deployed very quickly. Okay,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=1184) the pod is ready. Click connect. Click Jupyter&nbsp; Lab. Connect to Jupyter Lab. Then, following&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=1190) instructions here are really important. We need&nbsp; to upload install.sh file and downloader.py file&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=1196) because it will use both of them. So, you can use&nbsp; this upload icon, click here, go to the folder&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=1203) where the files are located, select both files&nbsp; like this, and upload. You can also upload all&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=1209) of them; it is fine. Let's click terminal, then&nbsp; let's copy this entire command lines from here,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=1217) paste it, hit enter. It will set the Hugging Face&nbsp; default download repository into the workspace,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=1225) so all the models will be permanently saved&nbsp; in your pod in your workspace, and it will&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=1230) install everything automatically for you. The&nbsp; installation has been completed. The model files&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=1236) are downloaded. Also, verify that there are no&nbsp; errors in the installation. If you are a Linux&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=1241) user and if you are installing manually, make sure&nbsp; that all the paths are accurate in the files that&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=1249) we are installing. So, open a new terminal&nbsp; from here. Then we are going to follow the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=1254) instructions here. After the installation has been&nbsp; completed, each time when you are going to run it,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=1259) copy this command, paste it, hit enter. It will&nbsp; start the Gradio application with Gradio sharing&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=1266) for us. Unfortunately, last time when I was using&nbsp; the proxy feature of RunPod, it wasn't working&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=1274) because of a bug or something in the Gradio. I&nbsp; reported it, and hopefully, it will get fixed in&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=1279) future versions of the Gradio. Okay, it is loading&nbsp; everything, downloading the missing models, when&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=1286) you run it the first time. You will also get such&nbsp; warnings and other messages when you are running&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=1292) it. The local app started. Now we are waiting&nbsp; Gradio live, share. Okay, here the Gradio live,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=1298) let's open it. And now we are running on RunPod.&nbsp; So, let's try the demo. Okay, the demo loaded.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=1305) Let's animate. You can watch the progress here. It&nbsp; should be pretty fast. Yes, under 1.5 minutes. You&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=1313) can also see the memory usage. Let's see the GPU&nbsp; utilization. Okay, GPU utilization is 100%, memory&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=1320) usage is 40%. If you use a longer DensePose, then&nbsp; it will use more VRAM, as I said many times in&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=1329) this tutorial. So, be careful with that. And we&nbsp; got the video output, as you are seeing right now.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=1335) We can click here and download the video. So, now&nbsp; let's install the second part, which is DensePose&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=1342) Maker. To install it, we need to upload the sh&nbsp; file again. So, let's click here. Let's go to the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=1349) DensePose, Compose. So, what we need to upload&nbsp; is install_detectron.sh file. Then, do we need&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=1358) anything else? Okay, we need to upload everything.&nbsp; So, let's make it like this. Let's make a new&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=1364) folder here, and say DensePose, like this. Let's&nbsp; enter inside it. Let's return, make the DensePose.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=1372) Except this folder, we upload everything. So,&nbsp; let's upload everything to be sure. Alright,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=1377) let's open a new terminal. Let's copy, paste this&nbsp; command. This will install everything inside this&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=1384) folder. So, when we are going to run it, we will&nbsp; enter inside this folder and run it. Alright,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=1390) the installation has been completed. So, let's&nbsp; upload our example video, which we shared inside&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=1397) Compose DensePose, and Example. Then, to run it&nbsp; again, we will edit the MakeDenseVideo.py file.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=1406) We have the Example.mp4, so let's change this&nbsp; to Example. Actually, the input will be Example,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=1415) and the output will be DensePoseExample, any name&nbsp; you wish. Save it. After we saved, the file name,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=1423) start a new terminal, go back, the instructions,&nbsp; and in here, you need to run these two commands&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=1430) one time after you start your pod. This is&nbsp; necessary, and just copy-paste everything.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=1437) Once you made it, you don't need to copy these two&nbsp; again and again. So, let's just execute these two&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=1443) first. Why these two are necessary only one time?&nbsp; Because apt commands are system-wide commands and&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=1450) they need to be executed once after you start your&nbsp; pod for the first time. Okay, it is done. Then,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=1457) let's open a terminal and copy-paste the entire&nbsp; command here. And then, it will start processing&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=1463) the file for us. The output will be inside this&nbsp; DensePose folder where we have uploaded and&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=1470) installed. Make sure that the paths are matching&nbsp; when you are running on RunPod, wherever you have&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=1477) uploaded files. I updated these instructions:&nbsp; upload into the DensePose folder like this, then&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=1484) run the command. So, follow the instructions here.&nbsp; Okay, now we are inside DensePose folder, the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=1489) virtual environment of which one, the Detectron 2&nbsp; is activated, and the files are generated. Let's&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=1498) see the generated DensePose video, which is here,&nbsp; DensePoseExample.mp4. Let's download it. Okay, it&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=1505) is downloaded. Then, let's give it as an input, so&nbsp; I will give the new downloaded as an input here,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=1512) and we already seen that in the beginning of&nbsp; the video. Then, we need to give a new image,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=1518) any image you can give. It will try to match it,&nbsp; so let's try something wild. Okay, everything&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=1524) is uploaded, and animate. So, this is how you&nbsp; can generate DensePose. You can also watch the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=1531) progress of your generation in the web UI. Compose&nbsp; Magic Animate web UI started, terminal in here,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=1540) in this case. The processing speed of the RTX&nbsp; 3090 is really good. This is how many seconds&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=1547) file. This is a six seconds file, and you see the&nbsp; speed of six seconds Magic Animate composition is&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=1555) 13.91 seconds per iteration, and it is going&nbsp; to take 25 iterations to generate the output&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=1565) video. All right, now let's install CodeFormer&nbsp; on RunPod. So instructions are clearly written.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=1574) Let's generate a CodeFormer folder to upload and&nbsp; install files. Let's go back to the workspace,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=1579) new folder, CodeFormer. Enter inside it,&nbsp; click the upload icon. Let's go to our files,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=1586) which are here, CodeFormer, and upload everything&nbsp; like this. If you use different path folder paths,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=1594) you need to change the commands. So, let's copy&nbsp; the command, open a terminal, copy-paste it. It&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=1600) will install everything into here with a virtual&nbsp; environment. Meanwhile, let's also upload one of&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=1606) the videos we have had previously. For example,&nbsp; let's fix the face of this video. Let's upload&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=1612) it into this directory. It is uploaded pretty&nbsp; fast. The installation has been completed. Again,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=1619) verify any errors or not. Now let's start&nbsp; the CodeFormer Gradio application. So,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=1625) let's copy the entire message here. By the way,&nbsp; again, be careful with the folder paths. If you&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=1631) upload into a different folder, then you need to&nbsp; change this path, or in your Linux machine. So,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=1637) let's start a new terminal, or paste the entire&nbsp; thing. You should also join our Discord channel,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=1643) so if you encounter any problem, you can message&nbsp; us there from our Discord channel, and when I look&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=1650) at your error, I can see your error reason. Okay,&nbsp; the Gradio app has started. Let's open it. Okay,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=1656) it's still wanting this. I don't know why. This&nbsp; is probably since I am recording a video. So,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=1661) let's upload our video. Okay, it is uploaded,&nbsp; I think. Yes, I can see it. So, this time,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=1668) let's try 50 percent instead of zero percent,&nbsp; and let's upscale 2x. Okay, there are also other,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=1677) you see, face detection models. I will go with&nbsp; RetinaFace. I think this is the best one. You&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=1683) can see the progress here. First time, it&nbsp; will download the necessary models. Okay,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=1687) the processing has been completed. It was&nbsp; pretty fast. You can also see the results in&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=1692) this folder. It is automatically saved, as you are&nbsp; seeing. And the Gradio result is also here. So,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=1698) let's look at it. Okay, this time the face quality&nbsp; is lower than before, but it is more similar. So,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=1705) if you want the best quality, make this&nbsp; zero. If you want the best resemblance,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXknItbMM8&t=1709) make this one. This is how it works. This is&nbsp; its logic. I hope you have enjoyed. Please like,&nbsp;&nbsp;
