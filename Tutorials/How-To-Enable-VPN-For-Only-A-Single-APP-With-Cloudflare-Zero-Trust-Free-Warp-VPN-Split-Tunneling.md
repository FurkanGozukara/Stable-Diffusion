Discord is blocked and you don't want to use VPN for your entire computer. So in this tutorial I will show you how to use the very best free VPN Cloudflare Warp but only for certain applications you want like Discord. So you will learn how to install and use Warp VPN for free on your computer which will make your entire computer to run through VPN. Then I will show how to register for free to Cloudflare Zero Trust and setup Include Split Tunnels for free to make only certain applications in your computer or in your device to use the VPN. This way, VPN will be used only for your certain applications and IP addressed and domain names that you decided. The rest of the internet traffic will flow from your normal Internet. So all applications will use your regular internet except the ones you decided to use with VPN.

In this tutorial, I will show Windows Discord APP as an example but the logic applies to all of the applications that you want to secure with VPN.

Türkçe açıklama:

Discord engellendi ve tüm bilgisayarınızda VPN kullanmak istemiyorsunuz. Bu nedenle, bu eğitimde en iyi ücretsiz VPN olan Cloudflare Warp'ı yalnızca Discord gibi belirli uygulamalar için nasıl kullanacağınızı göstereceğim. Böylece, bilgisayarınıza Warp VPN'ı ücretsiz olarak kurup kullanmayı öğrenerek tüm bilgisayarınızın VPN üzerinden çalışmasını sağlayacaksınız. Ardından, Cloudflare Zero Trust'a ücretsiz olarak nasıl kayıt olacağınızı ve sadece bilgisayarınızdaki veya cihazınızdaki belirli uygulamaların VPN kullanmasını sağlamak için ücretsiz Split Tunnels'ı nasıl kuracağınızı göstereceğim. Bu şekilde, VPN sadece belirlediğiniz belirli uygulamalar, IP adresleriniz ve alan adlarınız için kullanılacak. İnternet trafiğinizin geri kalanı normal internetiniz üzerinden akacak. Yani, VPN ile kullanmaya karar verdiğiniz uygulamalar dışında tüm uygulamalarınız normal internetinizi kullanacak.

Russian:

Discord заблокирован, и вы не хотите использовать VPN для всего компьютера. В этом руководстве я покажу вам, как использовать лучший бесплатный VPN — Cloudflare Warp — но только для определённых приложений, например, Discord. Вы научитесь устанавливать и использовать Warp VPN бесплатно на вашем компьютере, что позволит всему компьютеру работать через VPN. Затем я покажу, как бесплатно зарегистрироваться в Cloudflare Zero Trust и настроить функцию Split Tunnels бесплатно, чтобы только определённые приложения на вашем компьютере или устройстве использовали VPN. Таким образом, VPN будет использоваться только для выбранных вами приложений, IP-адресов и доменных имён. Остальной интернет-трафик будет проходить через ваше обычное подключение к интернету. То есть все приложения, кроме тех, которые вы решили использовать с VPN, будут использовать ваше обычное интернет-соединение.

- [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RSaYlmmblc&t=0) Greetings, everyone. Today I am going to&nbsp; show you how to install and use the very&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RSaYlmmblc&t=5) best free-to-use VPN on your Windows computer. It&nbsp; is from Cloudflare Warp VPN. It is not only free,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RSaYlmmblc&t=15) but also it allows you to run only certain applications&nbsp; that you want to use the VPN. Such as in this&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RSaYlmmblc&t=25) case, in today's case, I am going to show you&nbsp; Discord. Currently, I am not able to connect&nbsp;

- [00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RSaYlmmblc&t=30) Discord because of the blockade in my Internet&nbsp; Service Provider. So I will show you how to&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RSaYlmmblc&t=36) install Warp VPN and make only Discord to&nbsp; use this VPN. So you may be wondering why&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RSaYlmmblc&t=43) you should trust Warp VPN, how it is free. It&nbsp; is provided by Cloudflare and currently 25%&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RSaYlmmblc&t=52) of the entire Internet traffic, website's&nbsp; traffic is running through Cloudflare.&nbsp;

- [00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RSaYlmmblc&t=58) So it is the most trustworthy VPN service that&nbsp; you can find. It is not only a VPN service,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RSaYlmmblc&t=65) but their VPN service is the top quality and the&nbsp; most secure one. So how we are going to use it?&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RSaYlmmblc&t=72) This is the address of the Warp VPN. You only need&nbsp; to type Warp VPN to Google and enter its website.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RSaYlmmblc&t=80) Then download according to your operating&nbsp; system. I am on Windows 11, so I am going&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RSaYlmmblc&t=85) to select Windows from here. Click it to download. After downloading, click it to run. So this is the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RSaYlmmblc&t=91) installation. When you install and run it, it is&nbsp; so straightforward, but it will make your entire&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RSaYlmmblc&t=97) traffic to run through VPN. Let me show you. So when you install the Warp VPN, it will tell&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RSaYlmmblc&t=103) you that there is a newer version. Download&nbsp; and install it. This is a reported issue,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RSaYlmmblc&t=108) so their website is still not the latest version. Always use the latest version of the VPN client.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RSaYlmmblc&t=114) And then install and relaunch. You see&nbsp; it is installing the latest version.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RSaYlmmblc&t=118) It is getting installed. And you see&nbsp; it appeared here. Click Next. Accept.&nbsp;

- [00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RSaYlmmblc&t=123) And it is going to start. But before starting it,&nbsp; let me show you something. This is speedtest.net.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RSaYlmmblc&t=128) And you see this is my IP address. So&nbsp; currently my internet is running through&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RSaYlmmblc&t=133) my own internet service provider. If I click&nbsp; go, it will make a test. Let's make a test.&nbsp;

- [00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RSaYlmmblc&t=139) So this is my speed as you are seeing.&nbsp; And this is my IP address. Now I am going&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RSaYlmmblc&t=143) to start the Warp VPN. However, this is going&nbsp; to make entire traffic to go through the VPN,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RSaYlmmblc&t=149) which is not what I am wanting right now. So I want to make only certain applications&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RSaYlmmblc&t=155) to use the VPN. So currently I am going&nbsp; to show you first how to make everything&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RSaYlmmblc&t=160) run through the VPN. Then I will show you how&nbsp; you can limit it to only certain applications.&nbsp;

- [00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RSaYlmmblc&t=167) Okay, let's just wait until it fixes&nbsp; itself. It is going to make some DNS&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RSaYlmmblc&t=171) lookup. You see. And yes, it is connected.&nbsp; Let's refresh the page. And now you see&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RSaYlmmblc&t=177) it shows that I am using Cloudflare Warp VPN. Let's test its speed. This is the fastest free&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RSaYlmmblc&t=184) VPN that you can find. I assure you that. Because&nbsp; Cloudflare is a giant in the internet. And you&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RSaYlmmblc&t=191) see it is providing me 400 megabits per second&nbsp; free VPN traffic. This is just mind-blowing.&nbsp;

- [00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RSaYlmmblc&t=198) For example, when you have a problem when&nbsp; installing libraries, Python libraries,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RSaYlmmblc&t=203) other libraries, I suggest people to use the Warp&nbsp; VPN because sometimes internet service providers&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RSaYlmmblc&t=210) are blocking installation of Python libraries,&nbsp; AI libraries, and Warp VPN is fixing them.&nbsp;

- [00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RSaYlmmblc&t=216) Okay, so this was so straightforward&nbsp; part. So how we are going to make only&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RSaYlmmblc&t=220) certain applications run through the Warp&nbsp; VPN. This is the tricky part. When you&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RSaYlmmblc&t=225) click here, there is the Cloudflare Warp VPN. And when I click here, there is preferences. Now&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RSaYlmmblc&t=230) in the preferences, when you go to the advanced,&nbsp; there is split tunnels. However, there is no&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RSaYlmmblc&t=237) inclusive split tunnels in this interface. So what we need to do is we need to go to&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RSaYlmmblc&t=244) the account. And in here we need to&nbsp; log in with Cloudflare Zero Trust.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RSaYlmmblc&t=249) Click that part. Now you see this page&nbsp; appeared. Click next. Then click accept.&nbsp;

- [00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RSaYlmmblc&t=254) Then it will ask you to enter your team name. So&nbsp; you need to register the Cloudflare Zero Trust,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RSaYlmmblc&t=261) which I am going to show you right now. So how we&nbsp; are going to get an account on Cloudflare Zero?&nbsp;

- [00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RSaYlmmblc&t=266) Type Cloudflare Zero Trust to Google and go to&nbsp; the website. And in here click login. It will get&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RSaYlmmblc&t=273) you the login. So you can log in with Google&nbsp; or you can register with email and anything.&nbsp;

- [00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RSaYlmmblc&t=278) So I am going to log in with my Gmail account.&nbsp; You see continue. And it is going to register&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RSaYlmmblc&t=284) and log into the Cloudflare Zero. So this&nbsp; is our dashboard. This is the dashboard.&nbsp;

- [00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RSaYlmmblc&t=291) First of all, what we need to do is go to the Zero&nbsp; Trust here. So this is what we are going to do.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RSaYlmmblc&t=298) For Zero Trust, you need to continue registration. Enter a name here. secourses is my previously&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RSaYlmmblc&t=306) registered name. So enter your name. Any unique&nbsp; name that you want like mynewaccount00. Don't&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RSaYlmmblc&t=313) forget this name. So save it anywhere you wish. Next. Then you see there are bundles. You need&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RSaYlmmblc&t=320) to select a bundle. Currently I am on&nbsp; free bundle because you see it is going&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RSaYlmmblc&t=324) to allow me to use up to 50 devices which&nbsp; I have only one device and it is for free.&nbsp;

- [00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RSaYlmmblc&t=332) So you see it is for free. You don't pay&nbsp; anything and this is permanently free. Not&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RSaYlmmblc&t=336) like a trial or not like a 1 month, 2 month, 3&nbsp; month. This is permanently free up to 50 devices.&nbsp;

- [00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RSaYlmmblc&t=343) So select your plan as a free plan from here. Then&nbsp; you see it shows the payment. It is totally free,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RSaYlmmblc&t=351) permanently free until you decide to upgrade. So proceed to payment. Don't worry. Now you&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RSaYlmmblc&t=358) need to add a payment. I used my virtual&nbsp; credit card. You can use your own credit card,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RSaYlmmblc&t=364) whatever or PayPal. But don't worry. It is&nbsp; not going to take any money from your account.&nbsp;

- [00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RSaYlmmblc&t=370) So enter your every information and click next&nbsp; and your registration will be completed. So&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RSaYlmmblc&t=376) after that how we are going to set up is&nbsp; now I will log in my registered account.&nbsp;

- [00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RSaYlmmblc&t=380) So this is our dashboard. In this dashboard,&nbsp; in here what we need to do is go to the zero&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RSaYlmmblc&t=386) trust. Then in the zero trust. So first of all&nbsp; we need to go to the access and access groups.&nbsp;

- [00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RSaYlmmblc&t=392) Yes. So you need to add a group here. Currently&nbsp; I have a group. Let's add a group. Let's say test&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RSaYlmmblc&t=398) like this and you can set it as a default&nbsp; group and then there is including. I can&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RSaYlmmblc&t=404) include like email and you can enter your email. The registered email and save it. So this will be&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RSaYlmmblc&t=410) the my default group. I can delete them later if I&nbsp; want. It is fine. After you set the access groups.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RSaYlmmblc&t=417) Then the most important part comes how you are&nbsp; going to log in to your team. To be able to log&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RSaYlmmblc&t=424) in your team, you need to go to the settings&nbsp; and you need to go to the warp client here.&nbsp;

- [00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RSaYlmmblc&t=429) And you see there is device enrollment. In the&nbsp; device enrollment you need to go to the manage&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RSaYlmmblc&t=436) and add a policy. So let me delete this policy to&nbsp; show you. Add a rule here. Now give any name to&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RSaYlmmblc&t=442) here. Rule action allow. This is what is supposed&nbsp; to work like this. Let me show you email and enter&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RSaYlmmblc&t=449) your email and save. However this didn't work&nbsp; for me. I reported this to the Cloudflare team.&nbsp;

- [00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RSaYlmmblc&t=456) When you make like this you don't get activation&nbsp; email no matter what I have done. So currently&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RSaYlmmblc&t=462) what is working is bypass. And after bypass you&nbsp; need to make it everyone. I will show you don't&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RSaYlmmblc&t=467) worry how you can secure your account after&nbsp; this. Select everyone and you see there is the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RSaYlmmblc&t=472) assignment groups here. So it will be default and&nbsp; save. After you set this rule enrollment rules you&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RSaYlmmblc&t=478) are ready to log in to here. So this was my team name.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RSaYlmmblc&t=482) So this was my team name secourses. Click&nbsp; OK. And it will tell me I am successfully&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RSaYlmmblc&t=487) registered. Open the Cloudflare warp. And then I&nbsp; am currently disconnected. Let's connect to the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RSaYlmmblc&t=495) zero trust. It is connecting right now. So let's&nbsp; just patiently wait. Let it fix itself. OK. Yes I&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RSaYlmmblc&t=502) am connected. Now when I go to the preferences. In the in the advanced tab now there is include&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RSaYlmmblc&t=508) split tunnels. You see and here how I am going&nbsp; to include certain things. So to set these things&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RSaYlmmblc&t=516) you need to go to the settings back. And in&nbsp; here you need to go to the warp client. And&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RSaYlmmblc&t=523) in here go to the device settings. Add a profile.&nbsp; Currently there is default profile. Click edit.&nbsp;

- [00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RSaYlmmblc&t=528) And in here you will see that split tunnels. Click&nbsp; manage. And you see currently I am at the include.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RSaYlmmblc&t=536) So this is how you are adding things here from&nbsp; the selector. Select IP address and add the IP&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RSaYlmmblc&t=542) address that you want to allow. Select domain and&nbsp; add the domain that you want to allow. So how you&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RSaYlmmblc&t=547) can know which IP address an application uses. When you go to the task manager. When you go to&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RSaYlmmblc&t=551) the task manager. And let me show you. So I will&nbsp; just disconnect from the Warp right now to show&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RSaYlmmblc&t=557) you. OK. I have disconnected. And in the processes&nbsp; go to the performance tab. This is on Windows 11&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RSaYlmmblc&t=565) but same thing exists on Windows 10. To go to the&nbsp; resources monitor. And in here you see there is&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RSaYlmmblc&t=571) network tab. You will see the application images&nbsp; here. So whichever the application that you want&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RSaYlmmblc&t=577) to allow. Select it. For example Discord. When I click the Discord. When I click the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RSaYlmmblc&t=580) Discord. It will show the Discord trying&nbsp; IP addresses. So you need to add these IP&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RSaYlmmblc&t=587) addresses to there. And I used another strategy.&nbsp; So this is how you can find the IP addresses that&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RSaYlmmblc&t=593) it is trying to connect. You can also click the&nbsp; TCP and you can see the IP address. So this is&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RSaYlmmblc&t=599) the IP address. So I need to add this IP&nbsp; address to my allowed list. Let's see if it&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RSaYlmmblc&t=605) is matching to the here this one. OK. 195. OK. Currently it is not&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RSaYlmmblc&t=612) matching. Yes. It is not matching currently.&nbsp; But you can add this IP address. So how did I&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RSaYlmmblc&t=619) come up with this IP address? I looked&nbsp; for this: Discord IP addresses list.&nbsp;

- [00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RSaYlmmblc&t=625) And when you go to the IP addresses lookups. I think it was some&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RSaYlmmblc&t=629) of this. Yes. So you see it is also already&nbsp; on the Cloudflare I copied this from here.&nbsp;

- [00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RSaYlmmblc&t=635) NS lookup. Then I went to here and I added&nbsp; IP address and typed like this. You see it&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RSaYlmmblc&t=641) also adds the 32 as an IP address list and&nbsp; any description and add it. So this way you&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RSaYlmmblc&t=647) can add the inclusive IP addresses and domains. After you add everything you will see&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RSaYlmmblc&t=655) them here. Once you logged into your Cloudflare&nbsp; Zero and currently I won't be able to login

- [00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RSaYlmmblc&t=661) to my Discord because it is blocked right now. So when I enable the Zero Trust I will be able to&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RSaYlmmblc&t=669) connect it. Let me show you. Yes. I'm connected.&nbsp; Now this screen should load in a minute. We&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RSaYlmmblc&t=675) can also see the resources monitor. Yes. You can see now it is starting to be able&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RSaYlmmblc&t=681) to connect more IP addresses. You can see&nbsp; them here. You see it is getting connected.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RSaYlmmblc&t=686) Just wait a little bit until it fixes itself. I can see the Discord exe is making connections&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RSaYlmmblc&t=691) and I can see that this IP address is the same&nbsp; as the this added one. You see now it appeared&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RSaYlmmblc&t=698) since it is allowed to run through the VPN. And yes, my Discord has been loaded as you are&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RSaYlmmblc&t=704) seeing right now. And currently only Discord is&nbsp; running through the VPN. Let's verify it. Let's go&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RSaYlmmblc&t=710) back to the speed test and let's go to speed test. Now we should get my IP here. Yes. You see this is&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RSaYlmmblc&t=717) my original IP address and it is not running&nbsp; through the VPN. So currently only Discord&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RSaYlmmblc&t=723) application is running through the VPN and not any&nbsp; other application that I have like my browser or&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RSaYlmmblc&t=730) if I playing a game, whatever I am doing. This is how you limit it to the single or&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RSaYlmmblc&t=736) any number of applications. So what about the&nbsp; security? Now, after you logged into your device,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RSaYlmmblc&t=743) what you need to go to do? Go back to&nbsp; settings, go back to Warp Client device&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RSaYlmmblc&t=748) enrollment and just delete this. After you&nbsp; deleted it, no one else will be able to&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RSaYlmmblc&t=754) join again, but you will be kept as logged in. So this is how you can use the Cloudflare Zero.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RSaYlmmblc&t=761) Thank you very much for watching and hopefully&nbsp; amazing tutorial is coming for FLUX Fine Tuning.&nbsp;

- [00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RSaYlmmblc&t=766) I am doing huge amount of experimentation.&nbsp; Let me show you what I mean. So you see,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RSaYlmmblc&t=772) I have so many grid testing, so many&nbsp; experimentation, best configurations, training&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RSaYlmmblc&t=777) logs, even I am logging the training logs. So you will see the entire training logs,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RSaYlmmblc&t=782) how much time it taken, which checkpoints I&nbsp; found best with which number of images. So it&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RSaYlmmblc&t=788) will be hopefully amazing. So keep watching,&nbsp; subscribing and hopefully see you later.
