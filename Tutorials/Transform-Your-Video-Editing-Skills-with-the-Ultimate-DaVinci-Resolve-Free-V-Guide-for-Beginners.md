### Video Transcription


- [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-yYRGKyz8E&t=0) Greetings everyone. In this video I will demonstrate the use of DaVinci Resolve 18 for editing

- [00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-yYRGKyz8E&t=6) my video recordings prior to publication. DaVinci Resolve is a highly regarded free

- [00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-yYRGKyz8E&t=12) tool for professional video editing and the free version is more than sufficient for even

- [00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-yYRGKyz8E&t=17) experienced users. I will be editing a recent tutorial video recording in this demonstration

- [00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-yYRGKyz8E&t=23) so you can see the actual editing process in action.

- [00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-yYRGKyz8E&t=28) If you are new to video editing and interested in learning how to use DaVinci Resolve, this

- [00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-yYRGKyz8E&t=32) tutorial will serve an excellent guide for you.

- [00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-yYRGKyz8E&t=36) So you can go to DaVinci Resolve website as you can see the URL here, I will also put

- [00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-yYRGKyz8E&t=41) it into the description and then go to bottom and download the free version here. You see

- [00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-yYRGKyz8E&t=47) free download now and then install it and then start it with DaVinci Resolve here. Okay,

- [00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-yYRGKyz8E&t=58) it is getting open it. Okay, this is the beginning screen of the DaVinci Resolve. I am going

- [00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-yYRGKyz8E&t=63) to open an untitled project, a new project. You can give it any name. I will name it as

- [00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-yYRGKyz8E&t=70) SSD Speed Test because I am going to edit my SSD Speed Test video. Okay, so this is

- [00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-yYRGKyz8E&t=81) the beginning screen of a new project. So let's begin with the project features. You

- [00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-yYRGKyz8E&t=86) go to the right bottom tab and in here you see there is an icon. So you see there is

- [00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-yYRGKyz8E&t=92) timeline resolution, pixel aspect ratio, timeline frame rate and other things. Okay, and let's

- [00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-yYRGKyz8E&t=99) begin with adding our video files. So we go to file and import media and in here I am

- [00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-yYRGKyz8E&t=107) selecting the video files that I want to edit. Okay, it is asking me to change project frame

- [00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-yYRGKyz8E&t=112) rate, because the project frame rate by default was 24, but my videos have 60. So I am clicking

- [00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-yYRGKyz8E&t=119) change. Okay, now I will drag and drop them into the timeline, like this. So I click it,

- [00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-yYRGKyz8E&t=128) this button. It went to the end of the first video and I am adding the other one, like this,

- [00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-yYRGKyz8E&t=135) with dragging and dropping. Okay, and let's go to the edit screen. For going edit screen,

- [00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-yYRGKyz8E&t=142) we are going to this icon here. It is edit screen and when I click it, you see now I am

- [00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-yYRGKyz8E&t=148) in the edit screen. Okay, it is very important for you to know that when you are working

- [00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-yYRGKyz8E&t=153) with 4k resolution timeline resolution it will work very slow. So for editing purposes meanwhile

- [00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-yYRGKyz8E&t=161) editing you should change this to a smaller resolution, unless you have a very strong computer

- [00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-yYRGKyz8E&t=167) or you will have lag. So I am going to change it to this resolution. Okay, it will make

- [00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-yYRGKyz8E&t=174) it much faster. And there are two other tricks that you can improve your editing speed. Go

- [00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-yYRGKyz8E&t=181) to playback and, in here, change timeline proxy resolution to quarter. It will make the video

- [00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-yYRGKyz8E&t=190) lesser quality, but these are only effective meanwhile you are editing. When we export

- [00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-yYRGKyz8E&t=196) our final video, it will be full resolution and full quality. This will only make our

- [00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-yYRGKyz8E&t=201) job easier to work with our editing process. It will make it much faster. Okay, and there

- [00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-yYRGKyz8E&t=208) is one another thing. You see there is render cache. I am going to make render cache smart.

- [00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-yYRGKyz8E&t=213) So it will take all of the video into the cache while working on. If you have a such

- [00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-yYRGKyz8E&t=220) strong computer like mine, with a lot of memory, it will help you tremendously to improve speed.

- [00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-yYRGKyz8E&t=227) Okay, so let me quickly introduce you to the buttons. So this is the playback button. Greetings

- [00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-yYRGKyz8E&t=234) everyone. Today I am going to test two of my M2. Okay, this is how we stop it. You can

- [00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-yYRGKyz8E&t=240) change the speed of the playback from just press L button, L key on the keyboard, double times.

- [00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-yYRGKyz8E&t=247) When hit L double times now you see it is 2x playback, so you can change the playback speed like that.

- [00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-yYRGKyz8E&t=255) You can also go here and show timecode overlay like this, so it will show you the timecode

- [00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-yYRGKyz8E&t=261) overlay when you are not playing back it like this. Okay, and you can zoom and zoom in and

- [00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-yYRGKyz8E&t=272) zoom out with mouse wheel like this, and also you can change the zoom in and zoom out from

- [00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-yYRGKyz8E&t=277) here, as you can see. So I am going to set it fit. You can also change the, let's say,

- [00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-yYRGKyz8E&t=286) sensitivity of your tracker from here. For example, if I make it like this, it will be

- [00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-yYRGKyz8E&t=293) much more sensitive. You can check, you can see the time location of how fast it is changing.

- [00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-yYRGKyz8E&t=301) Or I can zoom out and now you see it is much faster changing. So this is pretty useful.

- [00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-yYRGKyz8E&t=308) Okay, this is called as Jog Wheel. You can also do very sensitive changing from here,

- [00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-yYRGKyz8E&t=318) as you can see. You can also jump to the video points from here, this scroll bar, very useful.

- [00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-yYRGKyz8E&t=328) So let's say, you want to speed up to turn 4x or 8x, just keep hitting L key on the keyboard

- [00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-yYRGKyz8E&t=336) like this, as you can see, now it is 4x. You can also see the shortcut icons here. You see

- [00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-yYRGKyz8E&t=348) play reserve, stop, play forward. So when we hit play forward multiple times, it plays faster

- [00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-yYRGKyz8E&t=355) and there is also pause, start playback and play again. You can zoom in and zoom out your

- [00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-yYRGKyz8E&t=362) master objects from here, as you can see, which you can add into your timeline.

- [00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-yYRGKyz8E&t=369) Okay, now I will show you how to cut video. This is the what may be the most important

- [00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-yYRGKyz8E&t=374) part. First, find out where you want to start your cutting. Okay, here, this is the place

- [00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-yYRGKyz8E&t=383) where I want to cut. Then I go to this razor blade icon and I click the line so it starts

- [00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-yYRGKyz8E&t=389) the cutting. Then I need to cut where I want to and cutting and remove the part.

- [00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-yYRGKyz8E&t=412) Okay, this is the point where I want cut to end. So I am clicking here. Now this part is

- [00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-yYRGKyz8E&t=417) cutted. So I am going to click selection mode and when I click it it will both select the

- [00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-yYRGKyz8E&t=423) video and audio, because they are currently linked and in here you can do delete selected.

- [00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-yYRGKyz8E&t=428) If you make delete selected, it will be like this: there will be an empty gap. So what

- [00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-yYRGKyz8E&t=435) we want to do is we select it and then we click delete key on our keyboard and it will

- [00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-yYRGKyz8E&t=441) automatically merge them as well. This is really important part to be careful. Also. DaVinci

- [00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-yYRGKyz8E&t=450) Resolve automatically saves every action you do. So. If you want to disable automatic

- [00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-yYRGKyz8E&t=456) saving, then you need to go to the preferences and in here you will see automatic saving

- [00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-yYRGKyz8E&t=465) in user tab and in here you see project save and load and it will have live save. This is

- [00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-yYRGKyz8E&t=470) really important because let's say you have made mistakes and it will get automatically

- [00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-yYRGKyz8E&t=476) saved. So be careful with that. I am going to close automatic save for my session. Okay,

- [00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-yYRGKyz8E&t=484) we can also set our clip play speed to certain value from here. For example, let's make it

- [00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-yYRGKyz8E&t=491) like this: 8.0.4 x 64 version. The versions are important. As you can see, now it is going

- [00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-yYRGKyz8E&t=499) faster. You don't have to necessarily make it 2x or other thing. You can set certain speed

- [00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-yYRGKyz8E&t=506) up from here. It, as you see, like this: these are the values. I think it is pretty decent.

- [00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-yYRGKyz8E&t=513) Okay, as you can see, like this. So I will reset it back to 100 by clicking here. Also, you see,

- [00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-yYRGKyz8E&t=521) now there are two windows displayed like this. It is about if you add some other video to

- [00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-yYRGKyz8E&t=528) here to show that, how will be the effect be, I will show that. But so if you want to see

- [00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-yYRGKyz8E&t=538) only single window, click here and you see, now you will see single window. It is about

- [00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-yYRGKyz8E&t=543) that. If you make a mistake while editing, just hit ctrl-Z and it will take your last action

- [00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-yYRGKyz8E&t=552) back, and where you can see actions are. Just go to edit button here in the tabs menu and

- [00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-yYRGKyz8E&t=561) in here you will see history and in here you can see all of the actions that I am doing.

- [00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-yYRGKyz8E&t=566) And if you open history window you can see all of the actions you have made. Also, in edit

- [00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-yYRGKyz8E&t=573) menu you see there is undo and redo, so you can do both of them as well. And one another

- [00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-yYRGKyz8E&t=580) thing: when you go back to this tab here, there is one another option. When you click this

- [00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-yYRGKyz8E&t=588) tools button, there are several options that you can do. For example, you can zoom height to

- [00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-yYRGKyz8E&t=594) see. You can zoom out, like this, and you can do cropping certain part of the video like

- [00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-yYRGKyz8E&t=604) this, and I am going to reset all. You can also do dynamic zoom. Or you can change the composite

- [00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-yYRGKyz8E&t=613) or the speed, like this, and so it will be different speed when playing. I am going to reset as

- [00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-yYRGKyz8E&t=621) well. So these are other useful tools that you can play with. Ok, actually I just needed

- [00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-yYRGKyz8E&t=629) to test out the history. So for history going, you just click the point where you want to

- [00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-yYRGKyz8E&t=635) go. If you go that point, it will move to that historical part. Unfortunately, look like there

- [00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-yYRGKyz8E&t=642) are certain limitation how much you can go back. So you see, I can go back to each history

- [00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-yYRGKyz8E&t=649) like this. It will be effective. It is pretty useful and I am going to back where I was

- [00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-yYRGKyz8E&t=655) here. So now I am at that point in the actions history. Ok, I have done the editing of first

- [00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-yYRGKyz8E&t=664) clip. Now I am going to append second clip of it. You can also make several channels like

- [00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-yYRGKyz8E&t=670) this. So the DaVinci Resolve works as from top to bottom. And let's say, if I also add

- [00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-yYRGKyz8E&t=677) part one here, however, it will only show the upper part, then the below part. Since the upper

- [00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-yYRGKyz8E&t=683) part is full screen, it is not transparent or anything. We won't see the lower part. Let

- [00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-yYRGKyz8E&t=691) me show you. Greetings everyone. So it is playing both of the sounds, but only the first part

- [00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-yYRGKyz8E&t=701) of the screen is visible. Let me, let's unlink them first. So you see there are link clips.

- [00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-yYRGKyz8E&t=708) Now I have unlinked them. Now I can select only sound of it and I can delete the selected.

- [00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-yYRGKyz8E&t=717) Ok, now let me play again. Ok, now I have. So you see, now I am only seeing the part two.

- [00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-yYRGKyz8E&t=724) How can I show you? So if I move it to the top? now let's play again. Ok, so you see the

- [00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-yYRGKyz8E&t=733) only the above part is now visible. I will also delete this and I will delete them again.

- [00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-yYRGKyz8E&t=739) Since I am just starting, I am going to drag and drop like this, and ok. Ok, now I will show

- [00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-yYRGKyz8E&t=747) you how you can add text to your timeline. But there is one very important thing that

- [00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-yYRGKyz8E&t=753) you need to be careful: if I select the added text and if I hit click, it will also delete

- [00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-yYRGKyz8E&t=759) the other part of the video. This is very dangerous because your video will get deleted along

- [00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-yYRGKyz8E&t=764) with the text or other objects. So I am doing control Z and I am selecting text only, and

- [00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-yYRGKyz8E&t=772) then I am right clicking and I am clicking delete selected. So let's add a text. So there

- [00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-yYRGKyz8E&t=778) are many text options in the toolbox menu. You see, you click the titles and from here

- [00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-yYRGKyz8E&t=786) there are titles, background reveal and other things. If you go your mouse hover like this,

- [00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-yYRGKyz8E&t=791) it will show you the animation that you are going to get, something like this. And if I

- [00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-yYRGKyz8E&t=797) make this like this, let's see, no, it's still not showing, ok, anyway. So I am going to adjust

- [00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-yYRGKyz8E&t=804) at basic text and I am dropping it upper, the video in the timeline, so it will be visible.

- [00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-yYRGKyz8E&t=814) Ok, I have added the text and written the text. So you see, now it is almost invisible. To fix

- [00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-yYRGKyz8E&t=821) it, you can either change the color of the text from here, and also there are many other

- [00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-yYRGKyz8E&t=828) options like size and other things. It's all up to you, to your taste. There is line spacing

- [00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-yYRGKyz8E&t=835) and tracking, and let's see, there is also drop shadow background color. Currently, there is

- [00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-yYRGKyz8E&t=843) background and its color is black, but its opacity is not much. So I am going to first

- [00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-yYRGKyz8E&t=852) change its height, like this, and change its width, like this, and the opacity I can change

- [00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-yYRGKyz8E&t=858) like this, as you can see, and I am going to change the position of the text to higher

- [00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-yYRGKyz8E&t=864) position. How am I gonna do that? Ok, I can just drag and drop the text, like this, so I don't

- [00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-yYRGKyz8E&t=871) want it to take the entire space. I am going to change its width, like this: outline width,

- [00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-yYRGKyz8E&t=880) ok. So we also need to change the text size, like this, for example, let's make it 60, ok,

- [00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-yYRGKyz8E&t=891) and let's move it to do like here. Let's also fix the width and height, ok, like this. Ok, I

- [00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-yYRGKyz8E&t=901) think it is now fine. Let's also increase the opacity, like this, ok. So it is totally up to

- [00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-yYRGKyz8E&t=909) you. The text design. It is not very easy actually, it is about your artistic skills and let's

- [00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-yYRGKyz8E&t=917) play it overall, ok. So I have opened the correct version of crystal disk mark. Ok, as you can

- [00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-yYRGKyz8E&t=926) see, now it is working. Ok. There is one another important thing with text and other stuff

- [00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-yYRGKyz8E&t=934) that is requiring positioning. If you change your resolution to higher resolution, the text

- [00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-yYRGKyz8E&t=942) may get out of proportion, so make sure that it is not becoming like that. So I am changing

- [00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-yYRGKyz8E&t=948) the resolution to test it out. I have saved it and now I will. It is much better overall.

- [00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-yYRGKyz8E&t=955) Ok, so I have. Ok, it is still looking good with higher resolution, so we can return back to

- [00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-yYRGKyz8E&t=961) our editing resolution to obtain higher performance. Meanwhile, we are editing the project. You can

- [00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-yYRGKyz8E&t=969) also change the text duration from here and you see it is showing me the preview. Yeah,

- [00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-yYRGKyz8E&t=981) it is showing us how longer it will appear. Ok, not exactly showing, though. I was expecting

- [00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-yYRGKyz8E&t=989) better, but you can understand it. Ok. So how much you want the text to be visible, you can

- [00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-yYRGKyz8E&t=996) just change the duration and I will make it. Yeah, this is fine point. Ok, now I am going

- [00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-yYRGKyz8E&t=1004) to add a cool text animation to certain part of the video. You can see digital glitch or

- [00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-yYRGKyz8E&t=1011) other things, and if you wonder where I am opening this toolbox. You can click here to

- [00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-yYRGKyz8E&t=1018) see, and in here titles. Ok, in here I am going to, I think, add: let's see this, or? Yeah, this

- [00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-yYRGKyz8E&t=1028) one looks cool, so let's add it to our video where we want. Ok, now I will show you another

- [00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-yYRGKyz8E&t=1035) very important thing. This kind of text effects and other things are really slow when you

- [00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-yYRGKyz8E&t=1041) execute them. Let me show. Ok, this is all for this video. I am going to upload a video about

- [00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-yYRGKyz8E&t=1048) how did I clone and verify the files in. But this time it was fast. Why? Because we did cache

- [00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-yYRGKyz8E&t=1055) them. Let me show you without cache and you will understand. So I am setting render cache

- [00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-yYRGKyz8E&t=1060) to none. Ok, the cache is gone. All for this video. I am going to upload a video about how did

- [00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-yYRGKyz8E&t=1069) I clone and verify the. Ok, I think, since I did cache, it was fast. So make sure that you

- [00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-yYRGKyz8E&t=1076) are setting cache from playback options and from here smart or user. I think smart is the

- [00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-yYRGKyz8E&t=1085) best option, I am not sure about. So you see, now, as soon as I set the cache, now cache icon

- [00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-yYRGKyz8E&t=1092) has appeared. I was having a lot of problem previously I knew this cache feature and, believe

- [00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-yYRGKyz8E&t=1100) me, you will understand that as well. All for this video. I am going to upload a video about

- [00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-yYRGKyz8E&t=1107) how. Ok, ok, now I have found a way to show you how caching matters. So I am deleting this another

- [00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-yYRGKyz8E&t=1118) text file. Make sure that you are deleting it with delete selected, otherwise it will

- [00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-yYRGKyz8E&t=1122) also cut the below video. I am going to use this one. Ok, I will expand its duration and

- [00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-yYRGKyz8E&t=1130) let's it's. Let's set its text and now see how slow it is. Ok, I will. You can keep it much

- [00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-yYRGKyz8E&t=1140) better with the new SSD, ok, ok, this is all for this video. I am going to upload a video

- [00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-yYRGKyz8E&t=1149) about how did I clone and verify the files integrity. So if you wonder how did. So you

- [00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-yYRGKyz8E&t=1157) see how it was slow. Ok, now I will show another thing. For changing the position of this text,

- [00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-yYRGKyz8E&t=1164) we need to go this tab and in here: Ok, for selecting text. You see there is ScaleUp_LowerThird.

- [00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-yYRGKyz8E&t=1171) We double click it and here we have the text. Now there is this icon, as you can

- [00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-yYRGKyz8E&t=1178) see, which will allow us to change the text position like this. Ok, this is the way to change

- [00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-yYRGKyz8E&t=1184) the objects position. And now we return back and the text is now there, as you can see. Ok,

- [00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-yYRGKyz8E&t=1190) now I will show you how you can precisely set the position of the element after I have

- [00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-yYRGKyz8E&t=1196) selected it. You see, I am able to change the position of elements from here. This menu is

- [00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-yYRGKyz8E&t=1203) much, much easier. I can also select the width and height like this. It is much, much easier

- [00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-yYRGKyz8E&t=1211) to do from this interface. As you can see, here I am doing like this. Ok, let me play it a little

- [00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-yYRGKyz8E&t=1221) bit, ok. Ok, this is all for this. Ok, it looks great. Ok, the main editing has been done. Now

- [00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-yYRGKyz8E&t=1230) I will show you another cool feature: that you how to add different clips from different

- [00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-yYRGKyz8E&t=1236) projects. To do that, we are going to home button here at the right bottom, and in here I am

- [00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-yYRGKyz8E&t=1244) going to open my another video. But before opening, you make sure that you have enabled

- [00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-yYRGKyz8E&t=1250) the dynamic project switching. I am opening, so now I can switch between both of the projects

- [00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-yYRGKyz8E&t=1257) easily. As you can see from here, in this project I am going to copy and paste a certain object

- [00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-yYRGKyz8E&t=1265) which I use. Let me show you. Ok, I think it was this one. Ok, so I am going to copy and

- [00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-yYRGKyz8E&t=1273) paste this object. I am selecting both objects with clicking control. I am clicking right

- [00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-yYRGKyz8E&t=1279) click and copy and I am returning back to my original project in here. Then I am going

- [00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-yYRGKyz8E&t=1286) to move to certain position. How? In here in my mouse cursor, you see there is a timing.

- [00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-yYRGKyz8E&t=1296) The time code starts from 01 in the DaVinci, so it is like starting from the hour one so

- [00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-yYRGKyz8E&t=1304) 01, and I am going to minute 2, so 02 0000. You see now it is 01, 02 0000. 01 is the hour, but

- [00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-yYRGKyz8E&t=1315) it starts from one hour by default. 02 is the minute and this is the second and millisecond.

- [00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-yYRGKyz8E&t=1321) So now you can see that I am positioned exactly at the minute 2 and in here I am going to

- [00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-yYRGKyz8E&t=1328) paste it with control V and now it is pasted. It is pasted at video 3, but it's fine. Now

- [00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-yYRGKyz8E&t=1334) let's play it. You see it is unallocated. I am going to set a simple volume and with this.

- [00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-yYRGKyz8E&t=1345) Ok, it is working great. By the way, I made this animation from an online website that I don't remember

- [00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-yYRGKyz8E&t=1351) the name. It was for free, ok. There is one another thing that I want to show you. Let's say, you

- [00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-yYRGKyz8E&t=1357) want to speed up certain part of the video. Ok, for example, I am making a cut in the let's

- [00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-yYRGKyz8E&t=1366) make in here and in here, so I want this part of the video. Right click the selected part

- [00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-yYRGKyz8E&t=1375) and in here you are going to click change clip speed. Ok, so currently it is 28 seconds

- [00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-yYRGKyz8E&t=1384) and you can speed up as much as you want. For example, let's speed up to 200. Ok, now you should

- [00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-yYRGKyz8E&t=1392) also click ripple timeline, so it will merge timeline and it will speed up that part like

- [00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-yYRGKyz8E&t=1399) this. Ok, now let's play this part as regular speed. If you wonder, now let's move to our

- [00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-yYRGKyz8E&t=1405) next test, which is auto disk benchmark 4.00.0 f2. Let's start. So you see, this part is now

- [00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-yYRGKyz8E&t=1412) double speed. One another cool thing is that after you make a save, if you go to history,

- [00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-yYRGKyz8E&t=1420) you will see that it is starting from the original point, like this it could. So it is

- [00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-yYRGKyz8E&t=1426) good to make disabling automatic save and taking saves time to time. There is also an

- [00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-yYRGKyz8E&t=1435) option in here, you see: revert to last saved version. When I click it, it will reload the

- [00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-yYRGKyz8E&t=1440) project into the last saved point. Ok, because I made some changes and now I wanted to revert

- [00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-yYRGKyz8E&t=1448) them back, and now I am back in the time. That is one another reason why you should disable

- [00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-yYRGKyz8E&t=1454) automatic save before you make experimental tests like, as just I have shown, speeding up

- [00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-yYRGKyz8E&t=1461) to certain part of the video. One another thing is that you can lock the clips and tracks.

- [00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-yYRGKyz8E&t=1467) If you lock them, then you won't be able to make changes on them. For example, I am locking

- [00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-yYRGKyz8E&t=1473) the track one and now if I go to cut, you see it won't be cut. Ok, it is a great feature. Once

- [00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-yYRGKyz8E&t=1480) you are sure that you are done with it, you can lock it and you can prevent accidental

- [00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-yYRGKyz8E&t=1486) changes on the tracks. You can also go to next part of the video with like here. It will go

- [00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-yYRGKyz8E&t=1494) to the sections where you make adds or cuts like this. It is pretty useful to navigate

- [00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-yYRGKyz8E&t=1503) between different clips in the timeline. Now I will show you how you can generate a watermark

- [00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-yYRGKyz8E&t=1509) and add it to your video. I am using these website, which is a free website, and it has

- [00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-yYRGKyz8E&t=1515) so many cool text like this, for example: let's say you want to generate a Software Engineering

- [00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-yYRGKyz8E&t=1529) Courses Channel. Let's say this will be our watermark text and you can copy it. This is

- [00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-yYRGKyz8E&t=1537) another text, another cool website, free website that centers your text like this. I am copying

- [00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-yYRGKyz8E&t=1544) it and I am pasting it to this website, as you can see, and it generates me a cool looking

- [00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-yYRGKyz8E&t=1551) text. You can pick other styles like this: ok. To center the text you need to set up different

- [00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-yYRGKyz8E&t=1565) spaces like this. Once you have generated your text, all you need to do is so simple: open

- [00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-yYRGKyz8E&t=1572) an example video like this one. Make it full screen. Take a screenshot with print screen. Then open

- [00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-yYRGKyz8E&t=1582) your favorite image editor. I am using Paint .NET, I am pasting it. Ok, I am going to cut the necessary

- [00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-yYRGKyz8E&t=1593) size, which is my native resolution, like this. Open in another window. Then add a layer like

- [00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-yYRGKyz8E&t=1604) this and copy and paste the image like this: set its position. If it is too big, then you

- [00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-yYRGKyz8E&t=1614) can resize it. Ok, resize the image, original image. Actually, let me resize it from here.

- [00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-yYRGKyz8E&t=1623) Let's say like this: or alternatively, you can change the text size here, for example, like

- [00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-yYRGKyz8E&t=1630) this: ok, let's say this will be our text size. Add it, set the position, for example, like this:

- [00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-yYRGKyz8E&t=1641) and then delete the first layer. Ok, and it becomes like this, with transparent background.

- [00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-yYRGKyz8E&t=1647) Save it. I will save as into my desktop, for example: test. Ok, oh, it did enter there, so let's

- [00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-yYRGKyz8E&t=1660) save it as logoTest, ok. Then let's return back to our editor and I am opening our edit

- [00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-yYRGKyz8E&t=1674) window. I am adding it, importing the media as the logo that we just generated from the

- [00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-yYRGKyz8E&t=1684) desktop here, and then I will drop, drag and drop it as the video 4. Ok, let's play the video.

- [00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-yYRGKyz8E&t=1694) Greetings everyone. Today I am going. So you see it is there. You can set a transparency

- [00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-yYRGKyz8E&t=1701) to it so it won't be like this. Let me do so. In paintnet, when I double click it, there

- [00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-yYRGKyz8E&t=1709) is a opacity. I am setting it like 200 and it becomes like this: let's save it. Ok and

- [00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-yYRGKyz8E&t=1717) done. Now I need to reimport it. Import media. Ok, and in here, logotest, I will delete this

- [00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-yYRGKyz8E&t=1729) one. Make sure that you don't hit delete button and right click and delete selected, so it

- [00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-yYRGKyz8E&t=1735) won't delete your video. Ok, now we have opacity and we can. We need to set its duration to

- [00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-yYRGKyz8E&t=1744) equal to our video duration. Ok, timeline duration. So our timeline duration is written here you

- [00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-yYRGKyz8E&t=1754) see: 10 minutes 13 seconds and 13 milliseconds. So I am going to right click the logo and

- [00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-yYRGKyz8E&t=1761) in here I am going to change clip duration. I am going to change it to equal to my video

- [00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-yYRGKyz8E&t=1766) duration, which is 10 minutes, ok, 13 seconds and 13 milliseconds. And now let's go to the

- [00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-yYRGKyz8E&t=1778) tab. Since it has a transparent background, it won't affect the rest of the video. Let

- [00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-yYRGKyz8E&t=1785) me show here. You see, it is unallocated. I am going to set a simple volume and with this.

- [00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-yYRGKyz8E&t=1795) Ok, as you can see. And let's check out the end of the video. And yes, it is exactly as

- [00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-yYRGKyz8E&t=1802) we wanted. Ok, finally, we are ready to export our video. This part is also really important.

- [00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-yYRGKyz8E&t=1811) First, let's fix back our timeline resolution to original resolution that we wanted: ultra

- [00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-yYRGKyz8E&t=1817) HD and 60 frame rates. Ok, save it. Then for exporting, we are going this tab you see, it

- [00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-yYRGKyz8E&t=1826) is Deliver tab. And in here we are going to set our project name. Ok, SSD test. I am going

- [00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-yYRGKyz8E&t=1833) to select the position from my drive. Ok, I have opened it, save. And in here I am going

- [00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-yYRGKyz8E&t=1843) to change format for mp4 and codec for h265. I find I found these are working very well

- [00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-yYRGKyz8E&t=1852) with YouTube. YouTube is processing this format faster and I am setting, restricting the maximum

- [00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-yYRGKyz8E&t=1859) kilobytes as I wish and other things I am not touching, and then we are clicking add

- [00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-yYRGKyz8E&t=1866) to render Queue. And then we are clicking render all. This is all for today. I hope you have
