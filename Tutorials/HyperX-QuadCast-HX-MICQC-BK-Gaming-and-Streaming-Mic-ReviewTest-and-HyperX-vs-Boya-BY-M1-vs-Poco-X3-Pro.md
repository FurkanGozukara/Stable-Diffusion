In this video, I am doing a box opening of my new #HyperX #QuadCast HX-MICQC-BK #gaming & #streaming #mic that I have purchased to improve my sound quality in my programming / lecture videos.

I have used my Phone Poco X3 Pro and Boya BY M1 mic to record the first part of the video where I do box opening.

Later I do test with the sound of my Poco X3 Pro phone.

Finally I move HyperX QuadCast sound testing on the computer.

=================================================

The HyperX QuadCast HX MICQC BK gaming and streaming mic is a high-quality microphone designed specifically for gaming and streaming. With its sleek design, versatile features, and exceptional sound quality, the QuadCast is a top choice for gamers and streamers looking to take their audio to the next level.

One of the standout features of the QuadCast is its four selectable polar patterns: cardioid, omnidirectional, bidirectional, and stereo. This allows you to choose the best pickup pattern for your specific needs, whether you're streaming a solo game, recording a group, or capturing ambient sounds. The cardioid pattern is ideal for streaming or recording vocals, as it focuses on the sound directly in front of the microphone while rejecting sounds from the sides and rear. The omnidirectional pattern is great for recording a group or capturing ambient sounds, as it picks up sound evenly from all directions. The bidirectional pattern is perfect for recording interviews or duets, as it picks up sound from the front and rear but rejects sound from the sides. And the stereo pattern is ideal for capturing a wide, immersive soundscape.

In addition to its versatile polar patterns, the QuadCast also has a built-in shock mount to reduce noise and vibrations from your desk or other surfaces. This helps to ensure that your audio is clean and clear, free from distracting background noise. The QuadCast also has a built-in pop filter to reduce plosives (hard "p" and "b" sounds) and sibilance (excessively sharp "s" and "t" sounds), further improving the clarity of your audio.

Another great feature of the QuadCast is its tap-to-mute sensor. This allows you to quickly and easily mute the microphone simply by tapping on the top of the mic. This is a convenient feature that can come in handy during gaming or streaming sessions, allowing you to quickly mute the mic when you need to take a break or have a private conversation.

In terms of sound quality, the QuadCast is top-notch. It has a high-quality condenser capsule that provides clear and accurate audio, with a wide frequency response and high sensitivity. This makes it great for recording vocals, instruments, or any other sound source. The QuadCast also has a built-in headphone jack, allowing you to monitor your audio in real-time. This can be a valuable tool for ensuring that your audio is coming through loud and clear.

One potential downside of the QuadCast is its price. At around $140, it's not the most affordable microphone on the market. However, its exceptional sound quality and versatile features make it well worth the investment for serious gamers and streamers.

Overall, the HyperX QuadCast HX MICQC BK gaming and streaming mic is a top-notch microphone that is perfect for gamers and streamers who are looking to improve their audio quality. Its versatile polar patterns, built-in shock mount, pop filter, and tap-to-mute sensor make it easy to use and deliver exceptional sound quality. While it may be on the pricier side, its high-quality performance makes it well worth the investment.

- [00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2-SeLW_Mko&t=1) Hello everyone. I am Dr. Furkan Gözükara.&nbsp; Today I am going to make a box opening and&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2-SeLW_Mko&t=6) review of HyperX Quadcast USB Microphone. This&nbsp; is a new microphone that I have purchased to&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2-SeLW_Mko&t=14) improve sound quality of my further videos&nbsp; that I am going to publish in this channel.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2-SeLW_Mko&t=19) So hopefully you will enjoy more from&nbsp; my videos with better sound quality in&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2-SeLW_Mko&t=27) future. The exact model of the microphone is&nbsp; HX-MICQC-BK. So let's start with opening it.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2-SeLW_Mko&t=56) I will also make a comparison with my current&nbsp; microphone as you can see here. It is Boya&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2-SeLW_Mko&t=64) By-M1 model. I will also put a link of it in the&nbsp; description so you can compare it. I will also&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2-SeLW_Mko&t=71) compare with the sound of my phone which I am&nbsp; recording right now. It is Xiaomi POCO X3 Pro.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2-SeLW_Mko&t=87) So this is what comes out of the box.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2-SeLW_Mko&t=104) They have made a sturdy box.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2-SeLW_Mko&t=115) As you can see it is a pretty big&nbsp; microphone. It looks solid, high quality.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2-SeLW_Mko&t=122) It has the necessary items to connect to a desk&nbsp; handler. I suppose. It is the product of Kingston.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2-SeLW_Mko&t=135) Alright. The features it has is listed in&nbsp; the behind of the box. Let me show you.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2-SeLW_Mko&t=147) Alright. We can say that it has&nbsp; stereo mode for vocal instruments,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2-SeLW_Mko&t=156) voice instruments. It has omnidirectional mode&nbsp; for multi-person podcasts, conference calls.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2-SeLW_Mko&t=165) It has cardioid mode for podcasts,&nbsp; streaming, voice-overs and instruments.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2-SeLW_Mko&t=172) It has bi-directional mode for face-to-face&nbsp; interviews. You can change the mode from&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2-SeLW_Mko&t=181) here very easily. Alright. It has&nbsp; USB connection and jack connection.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2-SeLW_Mko&t=195) It comes with a USB cable like this.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2-SeLW_Mko&t=205) Alright. Now I will try to connect this&nbsp; microphone into my phone. Then we will see&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2-SeLW_Mko&t=219) the sound quality of it. If I cannot connect&nbsp; it to my phone. Then I will continue from&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2-SeLW_Mko&t=228) recording in my computer. Before connecting the&nbsp; new microphone, let's try with the sound of my&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2-SeLW_Mko&t=239) phone itself. How does it sound? Currently I am&nbsp; recording sound with my phone itself. This is how&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2-SeLW_Mko&t=250) it sounds. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. And now&nbsp; we are going to see the sound recording with the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2-SeLW_Mko&t=260) new microphone that I have just purchased. Okay&nbsp; everyone. It turns out that this microphone is&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2-SeLW_Mko&t=266) not supporting mobile phones. Therefore, I will&nbsp; continue from my PC. It is compatible with PC,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2-SeLW_Mko&t=276) PS5, PS4 or Mac and such devices. It has a jack&nbsp; input where you could put AUX cable, male-to-male&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2-SeLW_Mko&t=287) AUX cable and connect it to your mobile phone.&nbsp; This is not working. This jack input is for only&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2-SeLW_Mko&t=294) hearing your own sound through an earphone.&nbsp; I have tried this kind of AUX cable.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2-SeLW_Mko&t=302) Currently I am recording without any filters&nbsp; or noise suppression or such things with OBS&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2-SeLW_Mko&t=309) Studio. You can compare this sound with my&nbsp; previous recording with BOYA by M1 model&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2-SeLW_Mko&t=318) microphone or with my phone's own sound recording&nbsp; which is POCO X3 Pro. Now I will open the noise&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2-SeLW_Mko&t=329) suppression filter and let's see how it works.&nbsp; Okay now I have enabled noise suppression as I&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2-SeLW_Mko&t=337) am showing right now in this picture so my sound&nbsp; will be much more clear and easier to hear.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2-SeLW_Mko&t=346) I hope you have enjoyed this video. Hopefully my&nbsp; future videos in programming will be much better,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2-SeLW_Mko&t=355) will have much better sound quality. I have a&nbsp; lot of courses in my mind such as .NET Core Web&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2-SeLW_Mko&t=365) API or Fully Entity Framework or MSSQL queries&nbsp; and such. We also now have a new Patreon page so&nbsp;&nbsp;
