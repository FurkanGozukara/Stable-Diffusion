SHOCKING: Tesla's Humanoid Robots Unveiled - Your Job Could Be Next! Tesla's Optimus robots (Tesla Bot) made their jaw-dropping debut at yesterday's Tesla Live event, and the world will never be the same! These real-life androids aren't just science fiction anymore - they're here to revolutionize everything you thought you knew about work and daily life. Imagine a world with no chores, but also... no jobs? As these metal marvels take over, millions could find themselves unemployed overnight! Will this usher in an age of abundance, or spell doom for humanity as we know it? You won't believe what's coming next. Are you prepared for the robot takeover? Watch to learn how to survive in this brave new world!

Full event video : [https://www.youtube.com/live/6v6dbxPlsXs?si=L0BcKI0R1gMbyMS2](https://www.youtube.com/live/6v6dbxPlsXs?si=L0BcKI0R1gMbyMS2)

Speech of Elon Musk:

Speaking of robots, everything we've developed for our cars, the batteries, power electronics, the advanced motors, gearboxes, the software, the AI inference computer, it all actually applies to a humanoid robot.

It's the same techniques, it's just a robot with arms and legs instead of a robot with wheels.

And we've made a lot of progress with Optimus, and as you can see, we started with someone in a robot suit, and then we've progressed dramatically year after year.

So if you extrapolate this, you're really going to have something spectacular, something that anyone could own.

So you could have your own personal R2-D2-C3PO.

And I think, at scale, this would cost something like, I don't know, $20,000, $30,000.

Probably less than a car, is my prediction, long term.

Now, you know, take us a minute to get to the long term, but fundamentally, at scale, the Optimus robot, you should be able to buy an Optimus robot for, I think, probably $20,000 to $30,000 long term.

So.

And what can it do? It'll be able to do anything you want.

So it can be a teacher, babysit your kids, it can walk your dog, mow your lawn, get the groceries, just be your friend, serve drinks.

Whatever you can think of, it will do.

And, yeah, it's going to be awesome.

And I think this will be the biggest product ever of any kind.

Because I think everyone, of the 8 billion people of Earth, I think everyone's going to want their Optimus buddy.

And there's going to be maybe two.

And then they'll be producing products and services.

I predict, actually, provided we address risks of digital superintelligence, 80% probability of good, a good outcome.

Look on the bright side.

The cup is 80% full.

The cost of products and services will decline dramatically.

And basically, anyone will be able to have any products and services they want.

It will be an age of abundance.

The likes of which people have not, almost no one has envisioned.

It will be something special.

So, and one of the things we wanted to show tonight was that Optimus is not a canned video.

It's not walled off.

The Optimus robots will walk among you.
