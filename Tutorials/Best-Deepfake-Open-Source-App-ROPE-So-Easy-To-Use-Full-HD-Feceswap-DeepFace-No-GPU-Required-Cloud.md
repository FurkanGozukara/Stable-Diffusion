### Video Transcription


- [00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLWLSszHwEc&t=21) So, in this video, I am going to show you how&nbsp; to use this amazing Rope application on Massed&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLWLSszHwEc&t=28) Compute with an amazing staggering 20 threads&nbsp; speed very fast very cheap. If you are following&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLWLSszHwEc&t=36) my tutorials, I have published the Windows&nbsp; tutorial of this application like two days ago. I&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLWLSszHwEc&t=42) have explained a lot of stuff there, so you should&nbsp; watch it, but in this tutorial, I will show you&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLWLSszHwEc&t=47) how to install and use this amazing application on&nbsp; Massed Compute. So if you don't have a GPU on your&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLWLSszHwEc&t=54) computer, you will be able to use this application&nbsp; with the maximum speed available. So as usual, we&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLWLSszHwEc&t=60) will download our installer zip files from here;&nbsp; the link of this post will be in the description&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLWLSszHwEc&t=64) of the video. Then let's move it into any folder&nbsp; where we want; let's move it into R drive and&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLWLSszHwEc&t=70) extract it into our R drive. You can extract&nbsp; it anywhere; after extraction, enter inside&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLWLSszHwEc&t=76) the folder and we have the installer scripts and&nbsp; all the instructions. Let's open the instructions&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLWLSszHwEc&t=82) readme file. So this is the readme file.&nbsp; First of all, you need to register the Massed&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLWLSszHwEc&t=87) Compute. If you register by using this link, I&nbsp; appreciate that. Also, we have a coupon code,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLWLSszHwEc&t=92) so registering from this link may be more helpful.&nbsp; Once you registered and added your billing details,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLWLSszHwEc&t=99) we are going to go deploy from this menu. Now&nbsp; this is super important; we are going to select&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLWLSszHwEc&t=105) RTX A6000 GPU because for this GPU, we have a&nbsp; super special coupon code. From the category,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLWLSszHwEc&t=113) select the creator; from image, select SECourses.&nbsp; Now you see, currently, this is 62 cents per hour,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLWLSszHwEc&t=121) but we are going to apply our coupon like&nbsp; this: SECourses, verify. After you did that,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLWLSszHwEc&t=127) you will get a price of 31 cents per hour. This&nbsp; is super amazing; this is much more cheaper than&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLWLSszHwEc&t=134) RunPod and Massed Compute is working many&nbsp; times better than RunPod. After doing this,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLWLSszHwEc&t=139) you can also set multiple GPUs, but I am going to&nbsp; use a single GPU and deploy. Once you deployed, just&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLWLSszHwEc&t=144) wait for it to be initialized. I also have this&nbsp; another instance, so I am going to terminate it&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLWLSszHwEc&t=149) and just wait the initialization. Moreover, when&nbsp; you are deploying, do not select this RTX A6000&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLWLSszHwEc&t=156) alt config; alt config has lesser RAM, you see, 24&nbsp; gigabytes. Also, our coupon code will not work on&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLWLSszHwEc&t=164) that, so RTX A6000 is the very best GPU. With RTX&nbsp; A6000, you will be able to use 20 threads. I am&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLWLSszHwEc&t=172) going to show you and it will be super fast. This&nbsp; is the fastest DeepFake, Face Swapping application&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLWLSszHwEc&t=179) available on the open source community right now.&nbsp; It will be super fast to change the entire movie,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLWLSszHwEc&t=187) video, or image into a deepfaked, face swapped image. So let's check out the running instance,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLWLSszHwEc&t=194) still initializing. Meanwhile, let me show you&nbsp; how we are going to connect to this machine. To&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLWLSszHwEc&t=199) connect this machine, we are going to use ThinLinc&nbsp; client. So type ThinLinc; the link of this will&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLWLSszHwEc&t=205) be in the description of the video. So let's go&nbsp; to the ThinLinc from here. If you are using Mac,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLWLSszHwEc&t=211) download Mac; if you are using Linux, download&nbsp; Linux. I am using Windows, so therefore I am&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLWLSszHwEc&t=216) going to download Windows. After downloaded,&nbsp; just click it; it will ask you permission,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLWLSszHwEc&t=221) accept by yes, then click next, accept terms and&nbsp; license agreement, install into default folder,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLWLSszHwEc&t=229) and just wait for the install to be completed.&nbsp; Then run the ThinLinc client. In the ThinLinc&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLWLSszHwEc&t=234) client, before we start, we are going to set up a&nbsp; synchronization folder. This is super important.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLWLSszHwEc&t=239) If you don't see these advanced settings, click&nbsp; here and then click options. In the options menu,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLWLSszHwEc&t=245) go to the local devices and disable other devices;&nbsp; we don't need them, just enable the drives. Click&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLWLSszHwEc&t=251) details. In the details, we are going to add&nbsp; a folder path from our computer which will be&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLWLSszHwEc&t=257) synchronized with the remote server. Now I am&nbsp; going to add the path again so you will see. I&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLWLSszHwEc&t=262) am going to add a path from my R disk drive; it is&nbsp; named as Massed Compute. Mass Compute. You can add any folder,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLWLSszHwEc&t=270) and just set it. If you want this folder to be&nbsp; only one side, make it read-only, but I want it&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLWLSszHwEc&t=276) to be double side, so I will download the files&nbsp; from the remote server as well, so it is read&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLWLSszHwEc&t=282) and write. Click OK and click OK. Now just wait&nbsp; for initialization to be completed; the machine&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLWLSszHwEc&t=289) is initialized, you see status running. Now we can&nbsp; connect. To connect, click here to copy the login&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLWLSszHwEc&t=296) IP, then paste it. You see we just paste the IP,&nbsp; not the HTTP part or the port part. Username is&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLWLSszHwEc&t=303) ubuntu and ubuntu and copy the password and paste&nbsp; it, then click connect. Then you will get this&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLWLSszHwEc&t=310) message; click connect. You see there is also end existing session option; if you select it, it will&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLWLSszHwEc&t=316) restart the machine, so do not select it unless&nbsp; you need it, like the synchronization is broken or&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLWLSszHwEc&t=322) something. On this screen, do not wait; just click&nbsp; start, and after a few seconds, you will get to&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLWLSszHwEc&t=328) this screen. So this is the machine that we have&nbsp; rented from the Massed Compute. It is running on a&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLWLSszHwEc&t=333) cloud remote server, so it is not related to our&nbsp; computer; whatever we do will be running on the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLWLSszHwEc&t=340) remote server. So this server has 48 gigabyte&nbsp; RAM memory and also 48 gigabyte GPU memory.

- [00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLWLSszHwEc&t=348) To see the GPU, let's type "nvitop" like&nbsp; this, and it will show us the GPU. You see, we&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLWLSszHwEc&t=353) have a 48-gigabyte GPU. Okay, so how are we going&nbsp; to install it? Double-click the home icon here; it&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLWLSszHwEc&t=359) will open the home menu. In here, scroll down and&nbsp; go to the Thin Drives. This is the folder where we&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLWLSszHwEc&t=365) will see our synchronization folder using Massed&nbsp; Compute. So these files are from my computer. When&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLWLSszHwEc&t=371) you get this software updater, just click cancel,&nbsp; and then you see these are the folders from my&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLWLSszHwEc&t=378) own computer. So my installer file is not here&nbsp; yet. Let's move the installer files into there.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLWLSszHwEc&t=385) So these are our installers. I am copying it and&nbsp; pasting it into my Massed Compute synchronization&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLWLSszHwEc&t=391) folder. After I copy-paste it, just refresh here,&nbsp; and it should arrive here in a moment. You see,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLWLSszHwEc&t=398) it is loading, and yes. Now do not install into&nbsp; the synchronization folder. Where to install? Just&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLWLSszHwEc&t=405) drag and drop it into the desktop like this, so&nbsp; it will be moved and copied to the desktop. Yes,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLWLSszHwEc&t=412) it is copied into the right bottom of the screen,&nbsp; so I moved it to here, you see. And you see,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLWLSszHwEc&t=418) all file operations have been completed now. Open&nbsp; the folder, and inside this folder, all you need&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLWLSszHwEc&t=425) to do is open "Massed Compute Instructions&nbsp; Read.txt" file. Just copy this installation&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLWLSszHwEc&t=432) command with Ctrl+C, then go back to the folder,&nbsp; you see, Home / Desktop / Rope_V4, in here click&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLWLSszHwEc&t=441) this three dots icon and open in terminal. Now in&nbsp; this terminal, you see, we are inside Desktop / Rope_V4

- [00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLWLSszHwEc&t=448) just right-click and paste and hit&nbsp; enter. You see, I copy-pasted this installation&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLWLSszHwEc&t=454) command, and nothing else you need. It will&nbsp; install everything automatically, download all of&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLWLSszHwEc&t=460) the models automatically, then we will just start&nbsp; the application after the installation has been&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLWLSszHwEc&t=465) completed. So the installation has been completed;&nbsp; it is pretty fast, under five minutes. The Massed&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLWLSszHwEc&t=471) Compute is working super fast, you see, virtual&nbsp; environment made and installed properly. So how&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLWLSszHwEc&t=477) are we going to start it? Let's enter inside the&nbsp; folder where we have installed. You see, it is&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLWLSszHwEc&t=482) installed here. Let's open back the instructions&nbsp; and just copy this, this command, Ctrl+C, return&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLWLSszHwEc&t=490) back to the folder, and on this folder, open a new&nbsp; terminal. You see, Desktop / Rope_V4, paste&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLWLSszHwEc&t=497) and hit enter, and that's it. This will start the&nbsp; application, and it will be ready to use. Yes,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLWLSszHwEc&t=503) it is started. Now I suggest you watch the Windows&nbsp; tutorial, why because I have explained everything&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLWLSszHwEc&t=510) in this tutorial about how to use, and how to&nbsp; use is totally the same. So I am first going to&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLWLSszHwEc&t=515) select the videos folder. You see, it started from&nbsp; here, and I have example videos inside, example&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLWLSszHwEc&t=521) face video. This is automatically downloaded for&nbsp; you with my script, but you can use your videos,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLWLSszHwEc&t=528) of course. So how you can use your own videos,&nbsp; put them into your synchronization folder,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLWLSszHwEc&t=534) then when you click this "select videos" folder&nbsp; from here, and when you go to the top like this&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLWLSszHwEc&t=541) and go to the Thin Drives here and go to inside&nbsp; your synchronization folder, your video files&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLWLSszHwEc&t=548) will appear here. So you can select here to list&nbsp; all the available videos inside that folder. When&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLWLSszHwEc&t=555) you select the folder, it will scan the folder&nbsp; and refresh the videos content. Currently, it is,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLWLSszHwEc&t=563) I think, still scanning. Let's see. Okay,&nbsp; it is trying to find whether there are any&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLWLSszHwEc&t=569) videos inside that folder. Yes, it found one&nbsp; file there. So let's return back to our examples&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLWLSszHwEc&t=577) which are inside. Let's go to the directory&nbsp; here. Okay, let's go to the home directory,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLWLSszHwEc&t=585) Ubuntu. This is where we are. It may be a little&nbsp; bit confusing in the first time when you are using&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLWLSszHwEc&t=591) inside Desktop inside Rope_V4 inside example&nbsp; face video and okay, and you see it's scanned the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLWLSszHwEc&t=598) folders. Then let's select the faces folder.&nbsp; So let's just click the faces folder selection,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLWLSszHwEc&t=603) and you see, same folder selected. This is&nbsp; where my files are, so I'm just going to okay,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLWLSszHwEc&t=609) and it will list me all the example faces as&nbsp; well. Let's select the "Test Video.mp4" file and&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLWLSszHwEc&t=616) let's click the "Find Faces". Let's select this&nbsp; face, then which faces I will use in the Windows&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLWLSszHwEc&t=623) tutorial I have shown how to use just a single&nbsp; face. So let's just select the first face. Okay,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLWLSszHwEc&t=629) it is selected, then we need to click "Swap&nbsp; Faces" and just wait for this face to be updated&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLWLSszHwEc&t=636) first. When you are waiting for an update, do not&nbsp; click anything else, just wait for the operation&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLWLSszHwEc&t=641) to completed. Unfortunately, the interface is&nbsp; not displaying the status. Yes, you see, it is&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLWLSszHwEc&t=648) changed. Then let's select the swapper resolution.&nbsp; Okay, it is applied. You see, it is significantly&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLWLSszHwEc&t=654) improved. Then let's also use the restorer.&nbsp; I use GPEN512; this is the best. Original.

- [00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLWLSszHwEc&t=660) Let's enable it from here. The interface is not&nbsp; working as good as on Windows, but it is working.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLWLSszHwEc&t=666) Yes, you see it is applied. However, it may be&nbsp; too strong, so let's make it 30 percent. And yes,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLWLSszHwEc&t=673) it is better. I also use strength, and I make&nbsp; this 20. I explained all of this in the Windows&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLWLSszHwEc&t=679) tutorial. Let's make the strength like 120.&nbsp; Once you change the numbers, hit enter. Let's&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLWLSszHwEc&t=686) also enable Occluder, Face parser to fix the mouth.&nbsp; So, I will make the mouth 1 like this, and yes,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLWLSszHwEc&t=695) it is all ready for this character. You see,&nbsp; as I move, it will get updated. You can also&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLWLSszHwEc&t=702) select multiple faces; it will average them.&nbsp; So, let's say I select this face like this,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLWLSszHwEc&t=708) and then I am going to select this face like&nbsp; this. So, it is going to use both of these&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLWLSszHwEc&t=713) faces' averages. The mouth is still not looking&nbsp; very good, so let's make the mouth 10, and it&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLWLSszHwEc&t=719) should fix it after we hit enter. Yes, you see,&nbsp; you need to hit enter so the slider will change;&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLWLSszHwEc&t=727) until that time, it won't work. Okay, 1 is&nbsp; working perfectly. Then let's also fix the face&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLWLSszHwEc&t=733) for this character as well. Let's select it from&nbsp; here. Okay, after we selected it, you see it will&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLWLSszHwEc&t=738) become red. Just wait because ThinLinc client&nbsp; is a little delayed. Then which one replaces it&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLWLSszHwEc&t=745) with this person? Okay, let's just wait, and then&nbsp; let's also average with this face. So, I am going&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLWLSszHwEc&t=752) to use these two faces. To select more than one&nbsp; face, keep pressing the control key, so it will&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLWLSszHwEc&t=758) allow you to select multiple faces. Okay, let's&nbsp; see, yes, both faces are now selected. There is&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLWLSszHwEc&t=766) a little bit of delay when you are using with the&nbsp; ThinLinc client, but it is working fine. And yes,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLWLSszHwEc&t=772) everything is set. So, how are we going to save&nbsp; it? Let's go to the very beginning or click here,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLWLSszHwEc&t=778) and we need to select the output folder. I&nbsp; am going to output it into my synchronization&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLWLSszHwEc&t=783) folder so that I can immediately download it from&nbsp; my own computer. Let's go to the thin drives,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLWLSszHwEc&t=790) mass compute, and okay, and that's it. We&nbsp; did set everything. Now on Massed Compute&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLWLSszHwEc&t=797) we have a huge amount of VRAM. You see, I&nbsp; used the nvitop command, and it is displaying&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLWLSszHwEc&t=804) VRAM usage. It is only using 4 gigabytes&nbsp; right now; therefore, I am going to increase&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLWLSszHwEc&t=809) this thread count to 20, so it will process 20&nbsp; frames at a time. Then let me show you the real-time&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLWLSszHwEc&t=815) speed of this and the VRAM usage. It is just&nbsp; mind-blowingly fast. There is no such application&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLWLSszHwEc&t=821) fast as this one. So, click record from here, and&nbsp; click play, and then let's return back to here,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLWLSszHwEc&t=827) and let's watch it. It is going to use over 30&nbsp; gigabytes VRAM, and let's see the speed once&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLWLSszHwEc&t=834) it starts. Yes, just look at this speed. This&nbsp; is the real-time speed, real-time processing&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLWLSszHwEc&t=839) speed. You see the speed; it is just mind-blowing.&nbsp; It is already over 30 frames. It is processing;&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLWLSszHwEc&t=845) this is real-time speed. It is using over 30&nbsp; gigabytes VRAM. So, with the Massed Compute,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLWLSszHwEc&t=851) only 31 cents per hour, we are able to use 20&nbsp; threads. This is the demo video that I have shown&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLWLSszHwEc&t=859) at the beginning. So, you see, this is how we use&nbsp; Massed Compute; it is just mind-blowingly fast,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLWLSszHwEc&t=865) and it is also super cheap. If you use RunPod, it&nbsp; will be much more pricey. It is 69 cents on RunPod&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLWLSszHwEc&t=873) for the same GPU. Moreover, on RunPod, there is no&nbsp; such desktop virtual machine. We did set up this&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLWLSszHwEc&t=881) virtual machine so that this application will work&nbsp; perfectly. We did install the necessary libraries,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLWLSszHwEc&t=887) necessary drivers. Moreover, if you are a Linux&nbsp; user and you are using Linux Ubuntu on your own&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLWLSszHwEc&t=895) PC, then you can use this script exactly there.&nbsp; Just make sure that you have installed CUDA 11.8.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLWLSszHwEc&t=903) What I mean by that, let's open a new window.&nbsp; This is just for local users, not the users&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLWLSszHwEc&t=907) that are going to use Massed Compute. nvcc --version So, you should get CUDA 11.8. And&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLWLSszHwEc&t=917) when you type Python 3, you should get 3.10.12. If&nbsp; you have installed Python, not Python 3, you can&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLWLSszHwEc&t=924) modify my installer script and then just use the&nbsp; installer as it is. It should work. Okay, we are&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLWLSszHwEc&t=932) almost done. Okay, video is rendered and saved,&nbsp; but I noticed two errors. You see, even though&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLWLSszHwEc&t=938) we have written 30 here, the slider is not changed&nbsp; because we couldn't hit the enter accurately. When&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLWLSszHwEc&t=944) you hit enter, you need to see the slider changed;&nbsp; you see the face change; so, it wasn't accurate&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLWLSszHwEc&t=949) rendering. And also, this was also not changed,&nbsp; so I hit enter, and you see the slider changed,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLWLSszHwEc&t=957) and I hit enter; you see, slider changed. You&nbsp; need to be careful with the enter keyboard and&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLWLSszHwEc&t=962) make sure that it is working. I'm going to take&nbsp; another render, then I will show you the result,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLWLSszHwEc&t=969) and we will end the tutorial. Okay, I click&nbsp; play. So, you first click the record, then you&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLWLSszHwEc&t=976) click the play to make it played. If you want to&nbsp; just replace an image, you use this image tab.

- [00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLWLSszHwEc&t=982) I have shown how to use it in the Windows&nbsp; tutorial. You really should watch the Windows&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLWLSszHwEc&t=987) tutorial because a lot of information is explained&nbsp; in this tutorial. Okay, new video rendering is&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLWLSszHwEc&t=994) also completed. Let's go to our synchronization&nbsp; folder. This is on my computer, you see. Then&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLWLSszHwEc&t=1001) let's double click and see the video. Yes, it&nbsp; is working amazing. It is synchronized with my&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLWLSszHwEc&t=1009) computer, so I can use it. Moreover, my installer&nbsp; script is also installing a video file player,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLWLSszHwEc&t=1016) so you can also use the Massed Compute to watch&nbsp; the videos. Let's go to the synchronization folder&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLWLSszHwEc&t=1024) inside home, inside thin drives, Mass Compute,&nbsp; and in here, you can just double click the video&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLWLSszHwEc&t=1031) files. By the way, not the temporary files, but&nbsp; the full files, and you will be able to play the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLWLSszHwEc&t=1037) video inside the Massed Compute as well. I hope&nbsp; you have enjoyed. Please also consider supporting&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLWLSszHwEc&t=1067) the remote computer. You don't even need to have&nbsp; a GPU to run this, just the computer where you can&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLWLSszHwEc&t=1072) install the ThinLinc client. It can be Mac, Linux,&nbsp; Windows, whatever, and then use it to connect to&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLWLSszHwEc&t=1079) the remote Massed Compute cloud server. Before you&nbsp; terminate your Massed Compute instance, make sure&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLWLSszHwEc&t=1087) that you have downloaded every file because once&nbsp; you terminate, all the data will be permanently&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLWLSszHwEc&t=1093) deleted. You won't be able to recover them. You&nbsp; see, selecting terminate will delete all data on&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLWLSszHwEc&t=1099) this VM, virtual machine, and recycle the machine.&nbsp; So, make sure that you have saved everything,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLWLSszHwEc&t=1105) then just terminate, and that's it. Hopefully,&nbsp; see you in another more amazing tutorial. More&nbsp;&nbsp;
