### Video Transcription


- [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9CGm7rgilE&t=0) In all of this, we're lucky to have a partner who&nbsp; is instrumental in making it happen. So I'd like&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9CGm7rgilE&t=6) to bring out a special guest, Satya Nadella,&nbsp; the CEO of Microsoft. Good to see you. Thank&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9CGm7rgilE&t=16) you so much. Thank you. Satya, thanks so much for&nbsp; coming here. It's fantastic to be here and Sam,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9CGm7rgilE&t=23) congrats. I mean, I'm really looking forward to&nbsp; Turbo and everything else that you have coming.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9CGm7rgilE&t=27) It's been just fantastic partnering with you guys.&nbsp; Two questions, I won't take too much of your time.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9CGm7rgilE&t=32) How is Microsoft thinking about the partnership&nbsp; currently? First, we love you guys. No, look,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9CGm7rgilE&t=43) it's been fantastic for us. In fact, I remember&nbsp; the first time I think you reached out and said,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9CGm7rgilE&t=48) hey, do you have some Azure credits? We've come&nbsp; a long way from there. Thank you for those, that&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9CGm7rgilE&t=53) was great. You guys have built something magical.&nbsp; I mean, quite frankly, there are two things for us&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9CGm7rgilE&t=58) when it comes to the partnership. The first is&nbsp; these workloads. And even when I was listening&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9CGm7rgilE&t=62) backstage to how you're describing what's coming&nbsp; even, it's just so different and new. I've been&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9CGm7rgilE&t=66) in this infrastructure business for three decades.&nbsp; No one has ever seen infrastructure like this. And&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9CGm7rgilE&t=72) the workload, the pattern of the workload, these&nbsp; training jobs are so synchronous and so large and&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9CGm7rgilE&t=78) so data parallel. And so the first thing that we&nbsp; have been doing is building in partnership with&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9CGm7rgilE&t=84) you, the system, all the way from thinking from&nbsp; power to the DC, to the rack, to the accelerators,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9CGm7rgilE&t=90) to the network. And just really the shape of Azure&nbsp; is drastically changed and is changing rapidly in&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9CGm7rgilE&t=99) support of these models that you're building.&nbsp; And so our job number one is to build the best&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9CGm7rgilE&t=104) system so that you can build the best models&nbsp; and then make that all available to developers.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9CGm7rgilE&t=109) And so the other thing is we ourselves are&nbsp; developers. So we're building products. In fact,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9CGm7rgilE&t=114) my own conviction of this entire generation&nbsp; of foundation models completely changed the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9CGm7rgilE&t=119) first time I saw GitHub Copilot on GPT. And so&nbsp; we want to build our Copilot, GitHub Copilot,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9CGm7rgilE&t=127) all as developers on top of OpenAI APIs. And so&nbsp; we are very, very committed to that. And what&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9CGm7rgilE&t=133) does that mean to developers? Look, I always think&nbsp; of Microsoft as a platform company, a developer&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9CGm7rgilE&t=139) company, and a partner company. And so we want to&nbsp; make, for example, we want to make GitHub Copilot&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9CGm7rgilE&t=145) available at the end of the year. first enterprise&nbsp; edition available So we want to make the to all&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9CGm7rgilE&t=148) the attendees here so that they can try it out.&nbsp; That's awesome. Yeah, we're very excited about&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9CGm7rgilE&t=152) that. And you can count on us to build the best&nbsp; infrastructure in Azure with your API support and&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9CGm7rgilE&t=163) bring it to all of you and then even things like&nbsp; the Azure marketplace. So for the developers who&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9CGm7rgilE&t=167) are building products out here to get to market&nbsp; rapidly. So that's sort of really our intent here.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9CGm7rgilE&t=173) Great. And how do you think about the future?&nbsp; Future of the partnership or future of AI? Yeah,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9CGm7rgilE&t=177) there are a couple of things for me that I think&nbsp; are going to be very, very key for us. One is I&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9CGm7rgilE&t=188) just described how the systems that are needed&nbsp; as you aggressively push forward on your roadmap&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9CGm7rgilE&t=197) requires us to be on the top of our game. And we&nbsp; intend fully to commit ourselves deeply to making&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9CGm7rgilE&t=203) sure you all, as builders of these foundation&nbsp; models. Have not only the best systems for&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9CGm7rgilE&t=209) training and inference, but the most compute&nbsp; so that you can keep pushing forward on the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9CGm7rgilE&t=215) frontiers. Because I think that that's the way&nbsp; we're going to make progress. The second thing&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9CGm7rgilE&t=219) I think both of us care about, in fact, quite&nbsp; frankly, the thing that excited both sides to&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9CGm7rgilE&t=224) come together is your mission and our mission.&nbsp; Our mission is to empower every person and every&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9CGm7rgilE&t=228) organization on the planet to achieve more. And to&nbsp; me, ultimately, AI is only going to be useful if&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9CGm7rgilE&t=234) it truly does empower, right? I mean, I saw the&nbsp; video you played. I mean, that was fantastic to&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9CGm7rgilE&t=240) hear those voices describe what AI meant for them&nbsp; and what they were able to achieve. So ultimately,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9CGm7rgilE&t=245) it's about being able to get the benefits of&nbsp; AI broadly disseminated to everyone, I think,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9CGm7rgilE&t=251) is going to be the goal for us. And then the&nbsp; last thing is, of course, we're very grounded in&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9CGm7rgilE&t=254) the fact that safety matters. And safety is not&nbsp; something that you'd care about later, but it's&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9CGm7rgilE&t=258) something we do shift left on. And we are very,&nbsp; very focused on that with you all. Great. Well,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9CGm7rgilE&t=263) I think we have the best partnership in tech.&nbsp; I'm excited for us to build AGI together. No. I'm&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9CGm7rgilE&t=266) really excited. Have a fantastic. Thank you very&nbsp; much for coming. Thank you so much. See you. OK.
