- [00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTE0diuotmw&t=71) When I was done dying.

- [00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTE0diuotmw&t=94) When I was done dying.

- [00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTE0diuotmw&t=101) When I was done dying.

- [00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTE0diuotmw&t=113) When I was done dying.

- [00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTE0diuotmw&t=125) When I was done dying.

- [00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTE0diuotmw&t=128) When I was done dying.

- [00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTE0diuotmw&t=130) When I was done dying.

- [00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTE0diuotmw&t=133) When I was done dying.

- [00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTE0diuotmw&t=136) When I was done dying.

- [00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTE0diuotmw&t=139) When I was done dying.

- [00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTE0diuotmw&t=142) When I was done dying.

- [00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTE0diuotmw&t=145) When I was done dying.

- [00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTE0diuotmw&t=147) When I was done dying.

- [00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTE0diuotmw&t=150) When I was done dying there at night in the dark in unseated rooms, so I thought maybe

- [00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTE0diuotmw&t=158) we could all just try to do a guided visualization so we can all get on the same place.

- [00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTE0diuotmw&t=164) I'm sure a lot of you traveled here today.

- [00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTE0diuotmw&t=166) So let's just fully relax our shoulders, feel our bodies in the seats, our feet on the floor.

- [00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTE0diuotmw&t=174) I used BARD and I was like, how can I structure a guided visualization for this event?

- [00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTE0diuotmw&t=181) They gave me some suggestions.

- [00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTE0diuotmw&t=185) So let's envision now that we're slowly, slowly lifting up from our seats, floating into the

- [00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTE0diuotmw&t=192) air, and let's imagine the air is not really cold.

- [00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTE0diuotmw&t=196) Let's imagine the air is a wonderful, wonderful temperature.

- [00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTE0diuotmw&t=200) We're floating here above the Shoreline Amphitheater.

- [00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTE0diuotmw&t=203) We see everyone else below.

- [00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTE0diuotmw&t=205) They're floating up with us.

- [00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTE0diuotmw&t=207) We're becoming mist, vapor, and there we see a beautiful, beautiful entity come towards

- [00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTE0diuotmw&t=214) us.

- [00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTE0diuotmw&t=215) And what is it?

- [00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTE0diuotmw&t=216) It's a bird, a bird with lips.

- [00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTE0diuotmw&t=221) Don't pay too much attention to the lips, but the bird has lips.

- [00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTE0diuotmw&t=224) And the bird says to you, hey, I just got a two-bedroom apartment.

- [00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTE0diuotmw&t=229) I'm looking for a roommate.

- [00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTE0diuotmw&t=230) And you think, wow, I never thought about relocating, but what neighborhood is it in?

- [00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTE0diuotmw&t=235) And the bird says, it's in this neighborhood that you've always wanted to live in.

- [00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTE0diuotmw&t=239) You say, that sounds great.

- [00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTE0diuotmw&t=240) Do you live with anybody else?

- [00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTE0diuotmw&t=242) You're like, no, but I have a lot of friends over.

- [00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTE0diuotmw&t=243) We played board games.

- [00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTE0diuotmw&t=244) Do you like board games?

- [00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTE0diuotmw&t=245) And you're like, yes, I do love playing board games.

- [00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTE0diuotmw&t=247) I have friends over.

- [00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTE0diuotmw&t=249) We play board games.

- [00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTE0diuotmw&t=250) They're like, great.

- [00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTE0diuotmw&t=251) Maybe my friends can become your friends and we'll start a whole community.

- [00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTE0diuotmw&t=253) And the bird's like, great.

- [00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTE0diuotmw&t=254) The only thing is it's kind of a small kitchen.

- [00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTE0diuotmw&t=256) So I don't like that many kitchen appliances.

- [00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTE0diuotmw&t=258) And you're like, that's wonderful.

- [00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTE0diuotmw&t=259) I normally eat out, but I'm trying to cook more at home.

- [00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTE0diuotmw&t=262) They're like, that's wonderful.

- [00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTE0diuotmw&t=263) We can make meals together.

- [00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTE0diuotmw&t=265) So now that we're all on the same page, we're re-centered here.

- [00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTE0diuotmw&t=271) Let's just think of how beautiful the world would be if there was a bird with lips that

- [00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTE0diuotmw&t=275) invited us to live with them and we could make wonderful, wonderful meals together.

- [00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTE0diuotmw&t=278) And that's sort of where this whole process has felt like.

- [00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTE0diuotmw&t=280) It's felt like being a bird with lips and finding a new roommate and making work with

- [00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTE0diuotmw&t=285) them.

- [00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTE0diuotmw&t=286) So if that makes any sense, I'll explain more.

- [00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTE0diuotmw&t=290) As a composer, it's always interested me in that composing music is an endless and evolving

- [00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTE0diuotmw&t=295) system of finding ways of communicating ideas about how to make sounds.

- [00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTE0diuotmw&t=299) Music has always been expanding with ways to share ideas and about how to make sounds

- [00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTE0diuotmw&t=304) while exploring what sounds are available to us that can be called music.

- [00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTE0diuotmw&t=309) Another thing that fascinates me as a composer is that throughout music's history, advancements

- [00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTE0diuotmw&t=313) in technology have always led to and coincided with advancements in musical thinking.

- [00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTE0diuotmw&t=318) New tools lead to new instruments, which lead to new musics, which leads to new boundaries

- [00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTE0diuotmw&t=322) to break, which leads to a restart for new tools.

- [00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTE0diuotmw&t=325) At one point in time, the trombone was a reflection of cutting edge musical technology.

- [00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTE0diuotmw&t=330) And like many technologies, when the first trombones entered the scene, they were viewed

- [00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTE0diuotmw&t=334) as highly controversial pieces of music tech.

- [00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTE0diuotmw&t=337) The same could be said for player pianos, synthesizers, synchronizing sound with film,

- [00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTE0diuotmw&t=342) home recording studios, and MIDI.

- [00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTE0diuotmw&t=343) I love all these things.

- [00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTE0diuotmw&t=345) And when I started getting into making computer music as a teenage nerd on my family computer,

- [00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTE0diuotmw&t=350) all of those tools were readily established and antiquated, but they were there for people

- [00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTE0diuotmw&t=354) to make music with.

- [00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTE0diuotmw&t=356) And ever since those early days of me playing with toy keyboards and primitive MIDI software,

- [00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTE0diuotmw&t=360) I've been trying to explore new ways of making new sounds.

- [00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTE0diuotmw&t=364) So when Google invited me to come meet with some of their AI researchers and talk about

- [00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTE0diuotmw&t=368) what they've been working on, I was pretty ecstatic to get the chance to be one of the

- [00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTE0diuotmw&t=371) first people to use these tools and see how they're being shaped and to meet with them

- [00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTE0diuotmw&t=375) and get a chance to make new music with them.

- [00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTE0diuotmw&t=378) Last month, I was pretty lucky to spend a few days with the researchers at MusicLM,

- [00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTE0diuotmw&t=382) Finacki, and Bard.

- [00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTE0diuotmw&t=383) They showed me the tools that they've been making and explained the concepts behind how

- [00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTE0diuotmw&t=387) they worked and allowed me to experiment with making sounds, music, and visuals with them.

- [00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTE0diuotmw&t=391) It felt a lot like those early days of sitting in front of a computer and having no idea

- [00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTE0diuotmw&t=396) what I'm doing or taking out a Casio keyboard and hitting buttons and see what happens.

- [00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTE0diuotmw&t=400) I had no idea what happened, and that was sort of the fun part, just mashing it and

- [00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTE0diuotmw&t=404) seeing what it is and making something new with it.

- [00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTE0diuotmw&t=406) It reminded me a lot of being a child again.

- [00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTE0diuotmw&t=409) So you'd hear that drum beat, and that would start, and the autocords would start, and

- [00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTE0diuotmw&t=415) the outputs from AI felt the same way.

- [00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTE0diuotmw&t=416) They would spark new ideas, they created building blocks to make new songs with.

- [00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTE0diuotmw&t=421) So the music that accompanied our guided visualization about becoming roommates was Duck with Lips.

- [00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTE0diuotmw&t=425) That was generated using the text prompt in text to music using sad, moody, new age music,

- [00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTE0diuotmw&t=431) simple piano, and synthesizer.

- [00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTE0diuotmw&t=434) Once we found an output that we liked, we started experimenting with it and processing

- [00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTE0diuotmw&t=437) it with Sing Song to create new variations to accompany the text to music outputs.

- [00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTE0diuotmw&t=442) We fed those results into themselves countless times, making dozens of iterations to explore,

- [00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTE0diuotmw&t=447) and those results were the song you heard again while I was rambling on about the bird

- [00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTE0diuotmw&t=449) with lips.

- [00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTE0diuotmw&t=451) The text to music model output is available as part of the AI Test Kitchen.

- [00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTE0diuotmw&t=454) You can sign up for the waitlist now.

- [00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTE0diuotmw&t=457) We also made a new track that we're about to play using a single word prompt, Chiptune.

- [00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTE0diuotmw&t=463) The name of the band is Chiptune, and our album is Chiptune, and if you'd like to also

- [00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTE0diuotmw&t=468) join the band, you're welcome to join the band.

- [00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTE0diuotmw&t=469) This is our first show.

- [00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTE0diuotmw&t=470) We're all members of the band, so thanks for joining the band.

- [00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTE0diuotmw&t=472) You can also quit the band at any time, and let's see how it goes.

- [00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTE0diuotmw&t=482) So we put the word Chiptune in, and this is the output that we got.

- [00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTE0diuotmw&t=489) We realized we needed another section of the song, so we fed it back into itself.

- [00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTE0diuotmw&t=496) And that gave us this B section.

- [00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTE0diuotmw&t=501) We knew it needed to be a full song.

- [00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTE0diuotmw&t=503) It couldn't just be these two riffs, but as you know, every song needs a chorus, so we

- [00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTE0diuotmw&t=507) made the opening part our refrain.

- [00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTE0diuotmw&t=509) And here we are back at it.

- [00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTE0diuotmw&t=511) We're like, all right, well, it's a Chiptune song, so maybe we should add some sort of

- [00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTE0diuotmw&t=517) adventure theme.

- [00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTE0diuotmw&t=518) So we're like, all right, well, now we know what's got to come up after this.

- [00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTE0diuotmw&t=523) So what came after this?

- [00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTE0diuotmw&t=525) It was the breakdown, because every song needs a breakdown.

- [00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTE0diuotmw&t=529) We're like, all right, we're going to be at the shoreline.

- [00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTE0diuotmw&t=536) People are going to be going nuts in their seats.

- [00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTE0diuotmw&t=537) There's going to be mosh pits everywhere, a crowd surfer, so when the breakdown's done,

- [00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTE0diuotmw&t=539) it's just going to be, we need this part, the full-on release.

- [00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTE0diuotmw&t=546) So this part came as kind of an unexpected little gift.

- [00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTE0diuotmw&t=562) We didn't really know that we'd be getting this.

- [00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTE0diuotmw&t=565) And that was the fun part of this discovery, being like, what we would put in would be

- [00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTE0diuotmw&t=571) like, finding a new sound that we didn't even expect to create.

- [00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTE0diuotmw&t=573) But then of course, we go back to our beautiful refrain, which we fell in love with at the

- [00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTE0diuotmw&t=586) beginning.

- [00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTE0diuotmw&t=588) Thank you very much.

- [00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTE0diuotmw&t=598) That was our first show for our band Chiptune.

- [00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTE0diuotmw&t=605) Some of the other band members are here in the audience, and some of our band members

- [00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTE0diuotmw&t=610) don't exist in the physical realm.

- [00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTE0diuotmw&t=612) I've never been in a band where the band members aren't physical entities.

- [00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTE0diuotmw&t=615) So all right, now that we've been basking in the Chiptune, let's return to our guided

- [00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTE0diuotmw&t=622) meditation.

- [00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTE0diuotmw&t=623) We've got a long day of Google ahead of us, and now let's place ourselves in a beautiful

- [00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTE0diuotmw&t=630) woods where our roommate's house is.

- [00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTE0diuotmw&t=634) We're wandering through the woods.

- [00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTE0diuotmw&t=636) We're coming back from a long day, and we're thinking about all of the Google jokes that

- [00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTE0diuotmw&t=642) we could make.

- [00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTE0diuotmw&t=643) And you're excited to tell your roommate the joke that you came up with.

- [00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTE0diuotmw&t=647) And you're like, and then they appear.

- [00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTE0diuotmw&t=649) You're like, hey, duck with lips.

- [00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTE0diuotmw&t=650) Doing this event for Google, and I'm thinking about using this joke.

- [00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTE0diuotmw&t=653) The duck's like, what is it?

- [00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTE0diuotmw&t=656) You just get mesmerized by the feathers.

- [00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTE0diuotmw&t=659) You're pulled deeper and deeper into this ethereal realm of pure feathers.

- [00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTE0diuotmw&t=663) The duck says, hey, I'm sorry, but I finished the oat milk.

- [00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTE0diuotmw&t=666) And you're like, oh, I was really looking forward to having that with my cereal.

- [00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTE0diuotmw&t=670) Like, that's okay.

- [00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTE0diuotmw&t=671) I'll go out and get more.

- [00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTE0diuotmw&t=672) And you're like, no, that's fine.

- [00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTE0diuotmw&t=673) I have this joke I want to tell you.

- [00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTE0diuotmw&t=675) And they're like, it's this more serious matter.

- [00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTE0diuotmw&t=676) It's more that I know you've been making oat milk at home, and we talk specifically about

- [00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTE0diuotmw&t=681) not having so many kitchen appliances.

- [00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTE0diuotmw&t=682) It's a small kitchen.

- [00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTE0diuotmw&t=684) But the contractor we wanted has the waiting list open, and I think we can expand the kitchen.

- [00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTE0diuotmw&t=689) And your heart just fills with pure love of the idea of blowing out the kitchen, adding

- [00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTE0diuotmw&t=694) more walls, adding more cabinetry.

- [00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTE0diuotmw&t=696) So you can make almond milk at home, oat milk at home, maybe even build a little stable

- [00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTE0diuotmw&t=702) so you can have other sort of mammalian milks.

- [00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTE0diuotmw&t=704) And the bird is like, this is the best relationship I've ever had.

- [00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTE0diuotmw&t=707) And you're like, this is wonderful bird with lips.

- [00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTE0diuotmw&t=709) Thank you so much.

- [00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTE0diuotmw&t=711) And then you go back to the house, and you're trying so deeply to remember the joke that

- [00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTE0diuotmw&t=715) you were going to make.

- [00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTE0diuotmw&t=717) And then you remember in the streets, it's Google Maps, and in the sheets, it's Google

- [00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTE0diuotmw&t=722) Sheets.

- [00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTE0diuotmw&t=723) And the duck's like, I think if you delivered it earlier, it might have landed a little

- [00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTE0diuotmw&t=727) better.

- [00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTE0diuotmw&t=728) Why don't we just go relax back in our home, drift away into the ether, and then tomorrow,

- [00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTE0diuotmw&t=732) we'll find a new way to find that joke into our everyday life.

- [00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTE0diuotmw&t=735) And you just wish so badly that the duck with lips was real.

- [00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTE0diuotmw&t=740) So if we could all now just collectively, with all of our ability and all of our might,

- [00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTE0diuotmw&t=745) try to manifest a duck with lips.

- [00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTE0diuotmw&t=748) And if we think hard enough, perhaps we can put this creature into reality, and we can

- [00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTE0diuotmw&t=753) share this utopian life with this beautiful roommate, the duck with lips.

- [00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTE0diuotmw&t=758) So this will be my last song.

- [00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTE0diuotmw&t=759) And then I'm going to do a five-hour set later, so don't worry.

- [00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTE0diuotmw&t=764) This song is called Change Your Life.

- [00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTE0diuotmw&t=766) And it seemed like a good thing to do right before this talk, where I think all of our

- [00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTE0diuotmw&t=770) lives are going to drastically change.

- [00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTE0diuotmw&t=772) And thanks so much.

- [00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTE0diuotmw&t=774) Again, my name is Dan Deacon.

- [00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTE0diuotmw&t=777) And again, these visuals were generated using Pinaki.

- [00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTE0diuotmw&t=780) Tonight, tonight, tonight, you're gonna change your life.

- [00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTE0diuotmw&t=786) You're gonna change your life.

- [00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTE0diuotmw&t=789) Tonight, tonight, you're gonna change your life.

- [00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTE0diuotmw&t=792) Tonight, tonight, you're gonna change your life.

- [00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTE0diuotmw&t=794) Tonight, tonight, you're gonna change your life.

- [00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTE0diuotmw&t=796) Tonight, tonight, you're gonna change your life.

- [00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTE0diuotmw&t=798) Your life, your life, your life, your life, your life, your life.

- [00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTE0diuotmw&t=802) Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight, you're gonna change your life.

- [00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTE0diuotmw&t=805) You're gonna change your life.

- [00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTE0diuotmw&t=807) Yes, you can.

- [00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTE0diuotmw&t=808) You know you can.

- [00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTE0diuotmw&t=809) Yes, you can.

- [00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTE0diuotmw&t=810) You know you can.

- [00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTE0diuotmw&t=811) Yes, you can.

- [00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTE0diuotmw&t=812) Yes, you can.
