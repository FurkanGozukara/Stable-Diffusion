### Video Transcription


- [00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zP8j8lKIHPI&t=13) Thanks, Sundar. Large language models have captured the world's&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zP8j8lKIHPI&t=17) imagination, changing how we think about the future of computing.&nbsp;

- [00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zP8j8lKIHPI&t=21) We launched BARD as a limited access experiment&nbsp; on a lightweight large language model to get&nbsp;

- [00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zP8j8lKIHPI&t=27) feedback and iterate. And since then, the team has been working&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zP8j8lKIHPI&t=31) hard to make rapid improvements and launch them quickly.&nbsp;

- [00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zP8j8lKIHPI&t=35) With Palm 2, BARD's math, logic, and reasoning&nbsp; skills made a huge leap forward, underpinning&nbsp;

- [00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zP8j8lKIHPI&t=42) its ability to help developers with programming. BARD can now collaborate on tasks like code&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zP8j8lKIHPI&t=49) generation, debugging, and explaining code snippets.&nbsp;

- [00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zP8j8lKIHPI&t=53) BARD has already learned more than 20 programming&nbsp; languages, including C++, Go, JavaScript,&nbsp;

- [00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zP8j8lKIHPI&t=61) Python, Kotlin, and even Google Sheets functions. And we're thrilled to see that coding has quickly&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zP8j8lKIHPI&t=69) become one of the most popular things that people are doing with BARD.&nbsp;

- [00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zP8j8lKIHPI&t=73) So let's take a look at an example. I've recently been learning chess, and for fun,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zP8j8lKIHPI&t=79) I thought I'd see if I can program a move in Python.&nbsp;

- [00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zP8j8lKIHPI&t=83) How would I use Python to generate&nbsp; the scholar's move in chess?&nbsp;

- [00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zP8j8lKIHPI&t=91) Okay, here BARD created a script to&nbsp; recreate this chess move in Python.&nbsp;

- [00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zP8j8lKIHPI&t=96) And notice how it also formatted the&nbsp; code nicely, making it easy to read.&nbsp;

- [00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zP8j8lKIHPI&t=102) We've also heard great feedback from developers&nbsp; about how BARD provides code citations.&nbsp;

- [00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zP8j8lKIHPI&t=107) And starting next week, you'll&nbsp; notice something right here.&nbsp;

- [00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zP8j8lKIHPI&t=110) We're making code citations even more precise. If BARD brings in a block of code, just click this&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zP8j8lKIHPI&t=118) annotation and BARD will underline the block and link to the source.&nbsp;

- [00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zP8j8lKIHPI&t=123) Now BARD can also help me understand the code.&nbsp;

- [00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zP8j8lKIHPI&t=126) Could you tell me what&nbsp; chess.bored does in this code?&nbsp;

- [00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zP8j8lKIHPI&t=133) This is a super helpful explanation of what&nbsp; it's doing and makes things more clear.&nbsp;

- [00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zP8j8lKIHPI&t=137) All right, let's see if we can&nbsp; make this code a little better.&nbsp;

- [00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zP8j8lKIHPI&t=140) How would I improve this code?&nbsp;

- [00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zP8j8lKIHPI&t=147) Okay, let's see. There's a list comprehension,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zP8j8lKIHPI&t=149) creating a function, and using a generator. Those are some great suggestions.&nbsp;

- [00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zP8j8lKIHPI&t=154) Now could you join them into&nbsp; one single Python code block?&nbsp;

- [00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zP8j8lKIHPI&t=159) Okay, now BARD is rebuilding the&nbsp; code with these improvements.&nbsp;

- [00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zP8j8lKIHPI&t=164) Okay, great. How easy was that?&nbsp;

- [00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zP8j8lKIHPI&t=166) And in a couple clicks, I can&nbsp; move this directly into Colab.&nbsp;

- [00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zP8j8lKIHPI&t=171) Developers love the ability to bring code&nbsp; from BARD into their workflow, like to Colab.&nbsp;

- [00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zP8j8lKIHPI&t=177) So coming soon, we're adding the ability to&nbsp; export and run code with our partner Repl.it,&nbsp;

- [00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zP8j8lKIHPI&t=182) starting with Python.&nbsp;

- [00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zP8j8lKIHPI&t=192) We've also heard that you want dark theme. So starting today,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zP8j8lKIHPI&t=205) you can activate it right in BARD&nbsp; or let it follow your OS settings.&nbsp;

- [00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zP8j8lKIHPI&t=209) And speaking of exporting things, people often&nbsp; ask BARD for a head start drafting emails&nbsp;

- [00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zP8j8lKIHPI&t=214) and documents. So today, we are launching two more export&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zP8j8lKIHPI&t=219) actions, making it easy to move BARD's responses right into Gmail and Docs.&nbsp;

- [00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zP8j8lKIHPI&t=231) So we're excited by how quickly&nbsp; BARD and the underlying models are&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zP8j8lKIHPI&t=235) improving, but we're not stopping there.&nbsp;

- [00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zP8j8lKIHPI&t=238) We want to bring more capabilities to BARD&nbsp; to fuel your curiosity and imagination.&nbsp;

- [00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zP8j8lKIHPI&t=244) And so I'm excited to announce&nbsp; that tools are coming to BARD.&nbsp;

- [00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zP8j8lKIHPI&t=253) As you collaborate with BARD, you'll be able&nbsp; to tap into services from Google and extensions&nbsp;

- [00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zP8j8lKIHPI&t=260) with partners to let you do&nbsp; things never before possible.&nbsp;

- [00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zP8j8lKIHPI&t=264) And of course, we'll approach this&nbsp; responsibly in a secure and private way,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zP8j8lKIHPI&t=269) letting you always stay in control.&nbsp;

- [00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zP8j8lKIHPI&t=273) We're starting with some of the Google&nbsp; apps that people love and use every day.&nbsp;

- [00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zP8j8lKIHPI&t=278) It's incredible what BARD can already do with&nbsp; text, but images are such a fundamental part&nbsp;

- [00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zP8j8lKIHPI&t=284) of how we learn and express. So in the next few weeks, BARD will become&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zP8j8lKIHPI&t=290) more visual, both in its responses and your prompts.&nbsp;

- [00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zP8j8lKIHPI&t=294) So if you ask, what are some must-see sites&nbsp; in New Orleans, BARD's going to use Google&nbsp;

- [00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zP8j8lKIHPI&t=301) Search and the Knowledge Graph&nbsp; to find the most relevant images.&nbsp;

- [00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zP8j8lKIHPI&t=307) Okay, here we go. The French Quarter, the Garden District,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zP8j8lKIHPI&t=310) these images are really giving me a much better sense of what I'm exploring.&nbsp;

- [00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zP8j8lKIHPI&t=316) We'll also make it easy for&nbsp; you to prompt BARD with images,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zP8j8lKIHPI&t=319) giving you even more ways to explore and create.&nbsp;

- [00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zP8j8lKIHPI&t=324) People love Google Lens, and in the coming&nbsp; months, we're bringing in the powers of Lens&nbsp;

- [00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zP8j8lKIHPI&t=328) to BARD. So&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zP8j8lKIHPI&t=337) if you're looking to have some fun with&nbsp; your fur babies, you might upload an image&nbsp;

- [00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zP8j8lKIHPI&t=340) and ask BARD to write a funny&nbsp; caption about these two.&nbsp;

- [00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zP8j8lKIHPI&t=345) Lens detects that this is a photo of a goofy&nbsp; German Shepherd and a golden retriever, and&nbsp;

- [00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zP8j8lKIHPI&t=350) then BARD uses that to create some funny captions.&nbsp;

- [00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zP8j8lKIHPI&t=358) If you ask me, I think they're both good boys.&nbsp;

- [00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zP8j8lKIHPI&t=360) Okay, now let's do another one. Imagine I'm 18 and I need to apply to college.&nbsp;

- [00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zP8j8lKIHPI&t=368) I won't date myself with how long it's been,&nbsp; but it's still an overwhelming process.&nbsp;

- [00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zP8j8lKIHPI&t=373) So I'm thinking about colleges, but&nbsp; I'm not sure what I want to focus on.&nbsp;

- [00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zP8j8lKIHPI&t=377) I'm into video games, and what kinds&nbsp; of programs might be interesting?&nbsp;

- [00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zP8j8lKIHPI&t=384) Okay, this is a helpful head start. Hmm, animation looks pretty interesting.&nbsp;

- [00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zP8j8lKIHPI&t=389) Now I could ask, help me find colleges&nbsp; with animation programs in Pennsylvania.&nbsp;

- [00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zP8j8lKIHPI&t=399) Okay, great, that's a good list of schools.&nbsp;

- [00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zP8j8lKIHPI&t=401) Now to see where these are, I&nbsp; might now say, show these on a map.&nbsp;

- [00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zP8j8lKIHPI&t=406) Here BARD's going to use Google Maps&nbsp; to visualize where the schools are.&nbsp;

- [00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zP8j8lKIHPI&t=412) This is super helpful, and it's exciting&nbsp; to see that there's plenty of options not&nbsp;

- [00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zP8j8lKIHPI&t=422) too far from home.&nbsp;

- [00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zP8j8lKIHPI&t=423) Now let's start organizing things a bit. Show these options as a table.&nbsp;

- [00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zP8j8lKIHPI&t=430) Nice, structured and organized,&nbsp; but there's more I want to know.&nbsp;

- [00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zP8j8lKIHPI&t=434) Add a column showing whether&nbsp; they're public or private schools.&nbsp;

- [00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zP8j8lKIHPI&t=442) Perfect, this is a great start to build on. And now let's move this to Google Sheets so my&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zP8j8lKIHPI&t=454) family can jump in later to help me with my search.&nbsp;

- [00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zP8j8lKIHPI&t=464) You can see how easy it will be to get a&nbsp; jump start in BARD and quickly have something&nbsp;

- [00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zP8j8lKIHPI&t=468) useful to move over to apps like Docs&nbsp; or Sheets to build on with others.&nbsp;

- [00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zP8j8lKIHPI&t=474) Okay, now that's a taste of what's possible&nbsp; when BARD meets some of Google's apps, but&nbsp;

- [00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zP8j8lKIHPI&t=480) that's just the start. BARD will be able to tap&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zP8j8lKIHPI&t=483) into all kinds of services from&nbsp; across the web with extensions&nbsp;

- [00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zP8j8lKIHPI&t=487) from incredible partners like Instacart,&nbsp; Indeed, Khan Academy, and many more.&nbsp;

- [00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zP8j8lKIHPI&t=494) So here's a look at one coming&nbsp; in the next couple months.&nbsp;

- [00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zP8j8lKIHPI&t=497) With Adobe Firefly, you'll be able to&nbsp; generate completely new images from&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zP8j8lKIHPI&t=503) your imagination right in BARD.&nbsp;

- [00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zP8j8lKIHPI&t=507) Now let's say I'm planning a birthday party&nbsp; for my seven-year-old who loves unicorns.&nbsp;

- [00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zP8j8lKIHPI&t=512) I want a fun image to send&nbsp; out with the invitations.&nbsp;

- [00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zP8j8lKIHPI&t=516) Make an image of a unicorn&nbsp; and a cake at a kid's party.&nbsp;

- [00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zP8j8lKIHPI&t=521) Okay, now BARD is working with Firefly&nbsp; to bring what I imagined to life.&nbsp;

- [00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zP8j8lKIHPI&t=532) How amazing is that? This will unlock all kinds of ways that&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zP8j8lKIHPI&t=537) you can take your creativity further and faster, and we are so excited for this partnership.&nbsp;

- [00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zP8j8lKIHPI&t=544) BARD continues to rapidly improve and learn&nbsp; new abilities, and we want to let people around&nbsp;

- [00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zP8j8lKIHPI&t=550) the world try it out and share their feedback. So today, we are removing the wait list and&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zP8j8lKIHPI&t=557) opening up BARD to over 180 countries and territories,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zP8j8lKIHPI&t=569) with more coming soon. And in addition to becoming available in more&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zP8j8lKIHPI&t=573) places, BARD is also becoming available in more languages.&nbsp;

- [00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zP8j8lKIHPI&t=577) Beyond English, starting today, you'll be&nbsp; able to talk to BARD in Japanese and Korean.&nbsp;

- [00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zP8j8lKIHPI&t=589) Adding languages responsibly involves deep&nbsp; work to get things like quality and local&nbsp;

- [00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zP8j8lKIHPI&t=595) nuances right, and we're pleased to&nbsp; share that we're on track to support&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zP8j8lKIHPI&t=599) 40 languages soon.&nbsp;
