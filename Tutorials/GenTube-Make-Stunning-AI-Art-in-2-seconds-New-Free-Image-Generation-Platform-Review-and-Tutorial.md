### Video Transcription


- [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qPNjIOdpnc&t=0) Greetings everyone. Today I am going to introduce&nbsp; you a new service called GenTube. This is a free&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qPNjIOdpnc&t=6) service, therefore, I wanted to make a review of&nbsp; it, an honest review. So you may be wondering,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qPNjIOdpnc&t=12) why free? Because the developer said that they are&nbsp; looking for monetization later, but currently it&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qPNjIOdpnc&t=18) is free to use and they claim that it will remain&nbsp; free to use. So it is so easy to use. I will put&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qPNjIOdpnc&t=24) a link below in the description of the video&nbsp; and also in the comments section. After logging&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qPNjIOdpnc&t=29) in with your account, you can use any account.&nbsp; Let me demonstrate you. When you open the link,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qPNjIOdpnc&t=35) you will get to this page and click login&nbsp; and login with Google, Facebook, Discord,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qPNjIOdpnc&t=40) whatever you want. I used Google. Then we click the create button,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qPNjIOdpnc&t=43) and whatever you want to generate, just type a&nbsp; prompt. Let's try something simple: an amazing,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qPNjIOdpnc&t=48) expensive, luxury sports car. By the way, it is&nbsp; automatically generating as you type. For example,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qPNjIOdpnc&t=54) let me demonstrate you. Let's say the daytime.&nbsp; Okay, I just pause and it should update the image.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qPNjIOdpnc&t=62) Okay, we can see that yes, the daytime is night.&nbsp; And it will automatically update it, as you can&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qPNjIOdpnc&t=68) see. There is this draft mode, and what this does&nbsp; is that when draft mode is off, creations will be&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qPNjIOdpnc&t=74) auto-saved to your profile. And if you don't want&nbsp; your generations to be saved, just enable this,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qPNjIOdpnc&t=81) and it will not be automatically saved. Then&nbsp; you need to click this add to profile button to&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qPNjIOdpnc&t=86) save them if the draft mode is on. But if you&nbsp; turn it off, it will be automatically saved.&nbsp;

- [00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qPNjIOdpnc&t=92) So where you can see your saved generations?&nbsp; Go to this link. This is my username, and&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qPNjIOdpnc&t=98) all my generations are here. So I can quickly see&nbsp; them. There is also my likes. If I like anything,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qPNjIOdpnc&t=105) it will be seen here. For example, let's like&nbsp; one of them. Okay, this one I liked here.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qPNjIOdpnc&t=111) Then let's go to my likes and let's refresh.&nbsp; Okay, yes, you see one like. I have one like,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qPNjIOdpnc&t=117) and these are my current stats. This platform, I&nbsp; think, will be like a marketplace where you will&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qPNjIOdpnc&t=124) follow other artists, other people who&nbsp; want to share pictures and other stuff,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qPNjIOdpnc&t=130) but it is not done yet. So currently it is&nbsp; fully free to use. You see there is a share&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qPNjIOdpnc&t=136) icon. You can share it on Reddit, Facebook, X,&nbsp; wherever you want. And there is this regenerate&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qPNjIOdpnc&t=141) icon. When you click this, it will regenerate the&nbsp; image with a different seed, like this. So you can&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qPNjIOdpnc&t=146) use this icon to regenerate as many times as you&nbsp; want until you get the perfect picture you want.&nbsp;

- [00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qPNjIOdpnc&t=152) And then there is this hand icon. When you click&nbsp; it, it will prepare your swiping experience,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qPNjIOdpnc&t=158) and what does that mean? It will automatically&nbsp; change styles between arrows. You see? So this&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qPNjIOdpnc&t=164) was my original. If I click bottom, it will change&nbsp; a random style like this. You see? Dark fantasy,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qPNjIOdpnc&t=170) Bumpy style, Impressionist. You see, this is a&nbsp; really good one. So it will randomly pick a style&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qPNjIOdpnc&t=177) and generate an image. This is a really, really&nbsp; cool feature. There is also a lightning button.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qPNjIOdpnc&t=182) So you see this was selected. This is why this&nbsp; is changing styles. If you select lightning, then&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qPNjIOdpnc&t=187) it will change the lightning like this. You see?&nbsp; Silhouette, rainbow gel, candlelit. This is really&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qPNjIOdpnc&t=193) cool. When you go to layout and click it, it will&nbsp; change the layout like this. You see? Negative&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qPNjIOdpnc&t=198) space, tension geometry. So between these three,&nbsp; it will randomly generate something that you may&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qPNjIOdpnc&t=205) like. This is a really cool feature. Then you can&nbsp; like the generation or you can share it. And since&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qPNjIOdpnc&t=211) my draft mode is not on, it will be automatically&nbsp; saved. And in the bottom, I can see that there&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qPNjIOdpnc&t=217) is a gallery of generations. So I can quickly&nbsp; move between all my generations. Let me zoom in&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qPNjIOdpnc&t=222) to show you. So you see in the bottom, you will&nbsp; see a gallery of your generations like this. And&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qPNjIOdpnc&t=229) when you click the prompt, it will show you the&nbsp; prompts that it has added like this automatically.&nbsp;

- [00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qPNjIOdpnc&t=235) Okay, then there is another icon, which is this&nbsp; one, as you can see. When you click it, it will&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qPNjIOdpnc&t=240) show you how you want to change the image. So if&nbsp; I drag and drop to this area like this, it will&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qPNjIOdpnc&t=248) turn it into pixel art, as you can see right now.&nbsp; Or if I want to make it cyberpunk, so I drag and&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qPNjIOdpnc&t=254) drop it to here, and it becomes cyberpunk. You can&nbsp; of course change the options available here. So&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qPNjIOdpnc&t=261) let's say I want to make it something like this,&nbsp; pixel art and anime art, a composition of them,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qPNjIOdpnc&t=266) and it becomes pixel and anime art like this. Or&nbsp; if I want anime and watercolor, I drag and drop it&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qPNjIOdpnc&t=272) into here, and it becomes something like that. So&nbsp; this is a really cool feature. You can change the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qPNjIOdpnc&t=278) options from these selections and you can change&nbsp; the image as you can see right now. This service&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qPNjIOdpnc&t=286) is really fast. Probably they are using SDXL. I'm&nbsp; not sure, maybe some flash versions of the Flux,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qPNjIOdpnc&t=291) but it is working really well. So you can change&nbsp; between options, you can change the position. It&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qPNjIOdpnc&t=297) will try to match it like this. You see, it is&nbsp; generating and every generation will be saved in&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qPNjIOdpnc&t=302) my profile. Sometimes it may take a while, just&nbsp; be patient. And it is here. So if I click here,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qPNjIOdpnc&t=309) yeah, it doesn't show the final prompt here. And&nbsp; if I click this icon, what it will do is it will&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qPNjIOdpnc&t=315) generate another one with my selection. So this is&nbsp; like a regenerate button, but now it is appearing&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qPNjIOdpnc&t=322) in here. So as I click it, it will regenerate&nbsp; another one. And if you want to turn off this&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qPNjIOdpnc&t=326) screen, just click this and it will be turned off&nbsp; and you will be back to these icons available.&nbsp;

- [00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qPNjIOdpnc&t=332) So when you return back to your profile here, you&nbsp; can do some actions here. For example, this star&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qPNjIOdpnc&t=339) icon will star it and it will be starred in my&nbsp; profile. So someone else may look at my profile&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qPNjIOdpnc&t=345) and see my starred images. Moreover, if you click&nbsp; on the image like this, let's click on this one,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qPNjIOdpnc&t=351) there are some other options. From this three-dot&nbsp; icon here, you can add to channel, download, hide,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qPNjIOdpnc&t=358) or report. So this report option is obviously for&nbsp; other people. Hide means that it will delete it&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qPNjIOdpnc&t=363) from your profile, and when you click download,&nbsp; it will download it. When I open the image,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qPNjIOdpnc&t=368) I can see that it added a watermark here,&nbsp; GenTube.app. This is probably for security&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qPNjIOdpnc&t=374) reasons. The resolution is 896 to 1152 pixels. So there are some other options in the bottom,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qPNjIOdpnc&t=381) as you can see, fish eye. For example, let's&nbsp; click this fish eye and it is remixing with the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qPNjIOdpnc&t=386) fish eye. Let's see what we will get. And yes. So&nbsp; the image is now like a picture taken with a fish&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qPNjIOdpnc&t=393) eye. Let's try art baroque. I don't know what this&nbsp; is, but let's see. Yes, a really cool design. And&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qPNjIOdpnc&t=400) then there is this option. Let's see what this is.&nbsp; It is remixing with this freezing icon. Oh, nice,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qPNjIOdpnc&t=406) very nice. So you can remix it with these&nbsp; options. For example, like 3D cartoon. Uh,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qPNjIOdpnc&t=413) not much 3D cartoon, but it is decent. We can&nbsp; always create more. And you see there is this&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qPNjIOdpnc&t=419) icon and it will change it again. So let's&nbsp; close this and return back to our generations.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qPNjIOdpnc&t=424) Everything is automatically saved. This is really&nbsp; cool. You don't spend time to click and save.&nbsp;

- [00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qPNjIOdpnc&t=428) So for example, let's click this one and let's&nbsp; try something to change. Let's say 3D render.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qPNjIOdpnc&t=435) Magic edit in progress, adding your edits. Wow, it&nbsp; really kind of turned the image into a 3D render.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qPNjIOdpnc&t=441) So this is how we can make changes. And it shows&nbsp; that apply edit. Interesting. So as I click this,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qPNjIOdpnc&t=448) it will reapply my prompt again and again to the&nbsp; latest image like this. And if you don't like the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qPNjIOdpnc&t=454) output, you can click this and it will regenerate&nbsp; the image with a different seed. You see,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qPNjIOdpnc&t=459) like this, until you get your desired output. The&nbsp; generations are really fast. You are watching it&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qPNjIOdpnc&t=464) live right now. And I am just a regular user.&nbsp; I don't even have anything special. I just&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qPNjIOdpnc&t=470) registered it, and since it is free for everyone&nbsp; right now, I have the same account as you are&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qPNjIOdpnc&t=476) going to get, nothing different. And when you&nbsp; click this icon, it will show all the available&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qPNjIOdpnc&t=482) options that they have. And then there are these&nbsp; icons. For example, this one shows you different&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qPNjIOdpnc&t=488) ones, like crystal beaded necklace. Okay, what&nbsp; is this? Okay, it turned the image into something&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qPNjIOdpnc&t=494) like this. Then there is this one. Oh, this is for&nbsp; some other options, remixing with morning. Yeah,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qPNjIOdpnc&t=500) now it is morning. And then there is this one.&nbsp; This is mixing with icons, basically. Let's try&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qPNjIOdpnc&t=507) this one. Okay, this is I think a parrot. Yes,&nbsp; it added a parrot. Really nice. Then then there&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qPNjIOdpnc&t=512) is this one. This is styles. Yes, this icon.&nbsp; So you can of course see all the styles that&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qPNjIOdpnc&t=520) it has and it is using your latest picture and&nbsp; applying the remix. Okay, nice, really nice.&nbsp;

- [00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qPNjIOdpnc&t=528) And it shows the final prompt that it used. You&nbsp; see, 'in a serene meadow illuminated by a golden&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qPNjIOdpnc&t=534) morning sunrise with a photorealistic level of&nbsp; detail.' And now enhanced with a style 3D style,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qPNjIOdpnc&t=540) 3D style text flare, and also rendered in&nbsp; a highly realistic and detailed manner,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qPNjIOdpnc&t=544) and you can read everything from here. It is&nbsp; really cool. It shows the prompt as well. So&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qPNjIOdpnc&t=549) I can copy this prompt. And when I copied it, you&nbsp; notice that it went into the generate images tab.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qPNjIOdpnc&t=556) And the prompt is directly used like this. So I&nbsp; closed those windows with escape, and I will go&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qPNjIOdpnc&t=562) to create from here and I will type my prompt.&nbsp; Let's see the generation, and we got it. Yes,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qPNjIOdpnc&t=567) really cool. So in the generate tab, I can use&nbsp; the prompt and I can edit it as I want and I can&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qPNjIOdpnc&t=573) generate. Then there is this beautify your image.&nbsp; Let's click it and let's see what it will do. This&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qPNjIOdpnc&t=578) prompt is already an extremely lengthy prompt, a&nbsp; long prompt, so it may not work very well. Yes,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qPNjIOdpnc&t=584) it didn't work very well in my opinion. But if&nbsp; you have something like this, so I have a sports&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qPNjIOdpnc&t=589) car prompt and I will use this beautify your&nbsp; image prompt and let's see what happens. Okay,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qPNjIOdpnc&t=595) it tried to beautify. You see a really lengthy&nbsp; prompt right now. So they are combining their&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qPNjIOdpnc&t=600) service with some backend LLMs and also some&nbsp; image generations and serving you everything&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qPNjIOdpnc&t=607) for free right now. And when you click it,&nbsp; by the way, you don't need to drag and drop&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qPNjIOdpnc&t=611) as I have shown. You can click to move there&nbsp; as well. So just click, just click, and you&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qPNjIOdpnc&t=617) will move there like this. And it is decent. The&nbsp; currently trending option is not working very well&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qPNjIOdpnc&t=622) in my opinion, so I'm just going to skip there. And this is our profile. In our profile, you can&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qPNjIOdpnc&t=628) click here to generate right now like we do. It is&nbsp; the same as clicking create here. So both of them&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qPNjIOdpnc&t=635) are opening the same. And there are notifications&nbsp; and we can click create now and let's see what&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qPNjIOdpnc&t=641) happens. Okay, it is not working right now. So&nbsp; let's try to generate a channel here. You see,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qPNjIOdpnc&t=648) we don't have any channel yet. Let's create a&nbsp; channel and let's say SECourses. This channel&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qPNjIOdpnc&t=653) is about... is about teaching AI. And there&nbsp; is this enhance. So when we click this, okay,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qPNjIOdpnc&t=661) it is going to edit, but you see it added too&nbsp; many details, so they need to fix this as well,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qPNjIOdpnc&t=667) probably. Okay, let's create the channel. And now&nbsp; let's say an amazing view of a mountain. And while&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qPNjIOdpnc&t=675) I am thinking, it is automatically generating&nbsp; the image. This is really cool, and it is done.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qPNjIOdpnc&t=679) Now it is also saved. You can see it's saved here.&nbsp; And now these two images are saved in my channel,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qPNjIOdpnc&t=685) not in my images. So there are your profile images&nbsp; and there are also your channel images. So this&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qPNjIOdpnc&t=693) is the SECourses channel. It shows there is one&nbsp; creator, two images. I can add a channel picture&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qPNjIOdpnc&t=699) from here. So you see when you click here, you&nbsp; can set your channel picture. You can invite other&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qPNjIOdpnc&t=704) people to join your channel. I don't know if they&nbsp; can join, but probably they can join from this&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qPNjIOdpnc&t=710) link. You can share it. You can edit picture, edit&nbsp; channel profile. You see then there is also hide&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qPNjIOdpnc&t=715) channel from profile. So it is all done from here. There is find creators. So if you know anyone, you&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qPNjIOdpnc&t=721) can type, search their name. And then there is Gen&nbsp; OC. So this is the original character generation&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qPNjIOdpnc&t=728) screen. Let's try something like that. Okay, let's&nbsp; say SECourses and let's add a gender, male, age,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qPNjIOdpnc&t=736) let's say middle-aged, style. Okay, I will try&nbsp; my style myself. Body type, yeah, these are not&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qPNjIOdpnc&t=742) very important. So I will say that, okay, let's&nbsp; close this. Okay, as I type here something, the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qPNjIOdpnc&t=748) image is also automatically changing. He is a very&nbsp; advanced PhD having computer engineer, scientist,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qPNjIOdpnc&t=756) okay, teaching AI. Okay, scientist teaching AI. It&nbsp; is generating my original character picture. Yes,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qPNjIOdpnc&t=763) it is fine. I am okay with that. Okay, it changed&nbsp; it. You can also click here and it will change it&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qPNjIOdpnc&t=768) more. Okay, like this, change again. Okay, it is&nbsp; generating right now. Okay, let's use this one,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qPNjIOdpnc&t=775) save and continue. This is not very important.&nbsp; And we have our character. Oh, I see. This is&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qPNjIOdpnc&t=781) just generating a character. I wonder if we can&nbsp; do some chat here. No, this is just an original&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qPNjIOdpnc&t=788) character we have. Let's add new descriptive&nbsp; modifiers. Let's try something like that. He&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qPNjIOdpnc&t=792) owns a YouTube channel where he teaches AI to the&nbsp; masses. Okay, let's see what happens now. Okay,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qPNjIOdpnc&t=800) it is going to generate. I see. And then save. And&nbsp; we have a variant of our original character. So&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qPNjIOdpnc&t=807) when I go to Gen OC, no, let's go to my profile.&nbsp; Okay, I have my spotlight. I have my creates. I&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qPNjIOdpnc&t=814) have my channel. Okay, there are my blocks.&nbsp; Okay, I can also generate a block. Let's say&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qPNjIOdpnc&t=821) place. Let's say mountain waves. Amazing mountain&nbsp; waves. And let's also enhance it from here. Okay,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qPNjIOdpnc&t=830) create a place. Okay, it is creating a place.&nbsp; Let's see what the place will do. Okay, we got&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qPNjIOdpnc&t=836) a place. Then there is be the first one to create.&nbsp; Okay, let's generate some images in this place.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qPNjIOdpnc&t=842) Okay, it automatically generated something based&nbsp; on my description. Really cool. Let's generate&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qPNjIOdpnc&t=847) another one. You see in the bottom it shows it's&nbsp; saved. If I don't want it to automatically save,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qPNjIOdpnc&t=852) I need to turn on draft mode. Nice, pretty cool.&nbsp; Let's generate another one. As you can see, I am&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qPNjIOdpnc&t=857) on a free account and there is no limitation. I&nbsp; am able to generate as much as I want. And I know&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qPNjIOdpnc&t=863) this sounds really suspicious. It also sounded&nbsp; suspicious for me, but as far as I understood,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qPNjIOdpnc&t=870) they are trying to increase their user base&nbsp; and they are going to go to find some funding,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qPNjIOdpnc&t=876) as usual, and some other ways to monetize&nbsp; it later, but currently it is free to use,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qPNjIOdpnc&t=883) so you can use it as you want. And when I return back to my channel,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qPNjIOdpnc&t=886) now we have spotlight, my generations, my creates.&nbsp; Okay, my creates is my generations, I think. Let's&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qPNjIOdpnc&t=894) click it. Yes. And then there are my channels.&nbsp; And then there are my blocks. Yes, as you can see,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qPNjIOdpnc&t=900) and my likes, and my liked pictures. Really cool.&nbsp; All really cool. We can also select a cover photo.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qPNjIOdpnc&t=906) When I click the select cover photo, it lets&nbsp; me pick the image that I want, and yes, it is&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qPNjIOdpnc&t=912) done. Okay, there is this show blocks button.&nbsp; It's really cool. And it shows all the options&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qPNjIOdpnc&t=919) available here. I can also set new subjects.&nbsp; For example, let's add a subject. SECourses,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qPNjIOdpnc&t=925) majestic dragons. Okay. And I will enhance&nbsp; the prompt. You see, it says more details,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qPNjIOdpnc&t=931) better results. You can always edit. Okay, create&nbsp; subject. And the subject is being generated. So&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qPNjIOdpnc&t=937) you can use these subjects. I don't know, maybe&nbsp; these are made from other people as well. And&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qPNjIOdpnc&t=942) my subject is ready. Let's go to profile and click&nbsp; create and let's see if our subject is here. Okay,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qPNjIOdpnc&t=949) where is the majestic dragons? Okay, place, image,&nbsp; style, research, search. Okay, there is recent.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qPNjIOdpnc&t=955) Yes. You see in the recent I can see that. And&nbsp; then there is this my blocks, and it will show&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qPNjIOdpnc&t=960) the subject that I made. Okay. If you don't want&nbsp; to see other people, just click this my blocks&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qPNjIOdpnc&t=965) and click SECourses, and it is selected. Now it is&nbsp; applying my subject and it is generating. So you&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qPNjIOdpnc&t=973) can generate multiple subjects and apply them.&nbsp; So let's disable this and let's add something&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qPNjIOdpnc&t=978) like style, and from this style, I will add&nbsp; photorealistic to the subject that I have. So this&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qPNjIOdpnc&t=984) way you can combine multiple subjects and it will&nbsp; automatically apply them and generate. I wonder&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qPNjIOdpnc&t=991) if we can see the final prompt used for this&nbsp; one. Okay, it doesn't show here. And then there&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qPNjIOdpnc&t=997) is 4K real. So I am applying multiple subjects to&nbsp; regenerate images. Okay, it is generating. So you&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qPNjIOdpnc&t=1004) need to figure out what you like. Let's go back&nbsp; to our channel. And when I click the image here,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qPNjIOdpnc&t=1010) does it show the final prompt? Yes, you can&nbsp; see the final prompt in the profile history.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qPNjIOdpnc&t=1015) So this is really cool. When I go to my creates&nbsp; and when I click the image, I can see that the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qPNjIOdpnc&t=1022) final prompt is here. So based on this prompt,&nbsp; you can modify your subject, your prompt. You can&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qPNjIOdpnc&t=1028) copy this. When you copy it, it will automatically&nbsp; open the create and you can create a new subject&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qPNjIOdpnc&t=1033) or when you click here, it will generate a&nbsp; new image as well, or you can click here,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qPNjIOdpnc&t=1038) it will generate a new image, and it goes on. And then there is join Discord, so you can join&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qPNjIOdpnc&t=1043) their Discord channel from here. And it opened the&nbsp; Discord application and is asking me to join their&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qPNjIOdpnc&t=1050) GenTube Creation. As you can see, on Discord,&nbsp; they have 2,000 members, pretty good. Then&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qPNjIOdpnc&t=1054) when I go back to my Gen OC, there is view saved&nbsp; characters. So from here, I have my characters.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qPNjIOdpnc&t=1060) I can make creative variants and I can share&nbsp; my character. Maybe they will add a chatting&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qPNjIOdpnc&t=1065) feature in the future. I don't know, but this&nbsp; is the Gen OC character they have. And finally,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qPNjIOdpnc&t=1071) there is share feedback, so you can give your&nbsp; feedback to them. And on the bottom left, I see we&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qPNjIOdpnc&t=1077) are hiring. When I click that link, it opens here.&nbsp; So you can see more information regarding their&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qPNjIOdpnc&t=1083) application. It says we are building the best AI&nbsp; consumer experience in the world. Our founders&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qPNjIOdpnc&t=1087) previously scaled a 5 billion plus platform and&nbsp; led a 160 million AI exit to Microsoft. So this is&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qPNjIOdpnc&t=1095) how this service is funded. They are using their&nbsp; previous sale, and probably once this website gets&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qPNjIOdpnc&t=1102) to a large enough user base, they will sell this&nbsp; as well, probably. So you can also read here and&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qPNjIOdpnc&t=1107) see. Thanks so much for watching. Hopefully&nbsp; see you in another amazing tutorial video.
