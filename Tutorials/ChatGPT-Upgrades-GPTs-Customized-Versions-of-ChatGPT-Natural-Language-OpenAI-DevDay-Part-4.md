### Video Transcription


- [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk4v8yMJz8g&t=0) Even though this is a developer conference,&nbsp; we can't resist making some improvements&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk4v8yMJz8g&t=3) to ChatGPT. So a small one, ChatGPT now uses&nbsp; GPT-4 Turbo with all the latest improvements,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk4v8yMJz8g&t=11) including the latest knowledge cutoff, which we'll&nbsp; continue to update. That's all live today. It can&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk4v8yMJz8g&t=16) now browse the web when it needs to, write and&nbsp; run code, analyze data, take and generate images,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk4v8yMJz8g&t=22) and much more. And we heard your feedback,&nbsp; that model picker, extremely annoying,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk4v8yMJz8g&t=26) that is gone starting today. You will not have to&nbsp; click around the drop down menu. All of this will&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk4v8yMJz8g&t=30) just work together. ChatGPT, yeah. ChatGPT will&nbsp; just know what to use and when you need it. But&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk4v8yMJz8g&t=43) that's not the main thing. And neither was price,&nbsp; actually, the main developer request. There was&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk4v8yMJz8g&t=49) one that was even bigger than that. And I want&nbsp; to talk about where we're headed. And the main&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk4v8yMJz8g&t=54) thing we're here to talk about today. We believe&nbsp; that if you give people better tools, they will&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk4v8yMJz8g&t=60) do amazing things. We know that people want AI&nbsp; that is smarter, more personal, more customizable,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk4v8yMJz8g&t=65) can do more on your behalf. Eventually,&nbsp; you'll just ask a computer for what you need,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk4v8yMJz8g&t=71) and it will do all of these tasks for you. These&nbsp; capabilities are often talked in the AI field&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk4v8yMJz8g&t=77) about as agents. The upsides of this are going to&nbsp; be tremendous. At OpenAI, we really believe that&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk4v8yMJz8g&t=85) gradual iterative deployment is the best way to&nbsp; address the safety issues, the safety challenges&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk4v8yMJz8g&t=90) with AI. We think it's especially important to&nbsp; move carefully towards this future of agents.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk4v8yMJz8g&t=95) It's going to require a lot of technical work and&nbsp; a lot of thoughtful consideration by society. So,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk4v8yMJz8g&t=102) today, we're taking our first small step that&nbsp; moves us towards this future. We're thrilled&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk4v8yMJz8g&t=107) to introduce GPTs. GPTs are tailored versions&nbsp; of ChatGPT. You can build a GPT, a customized&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk4v8yMJz8g&t=120) version of ChatGPT, for almost anything with&nbsp; instructions, expanded knowledge, and actions,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk4v8yMJz8g&t=127) and then you can publish it for others to use.&nbsp; And because they combine instructions, expanded&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk4v8yMJz8g&t=133) knowledge, and actions, they can be more helpful&nbsp; to you. They can work better in many contexts,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk4v8yMJz8g&t=138) and they can give you better control. They'll make&nbsp; it easier for you to accomplish all sorts of tasks&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk4v8yMJz8g&t=143) or just have more fun. And you'll be able to use&nbsp; them right within ChatGPT. You can, in effect,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk4v8yMJz8g&t=150) program a GPT with language just by talking to&nbsp; it. It's easy to customize the behavior so that it&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk4v8yMJz8g&t=155) fits what you want. This makes building them very&nbsp; accessible, and it gives agency to everyone. So,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk4v8yMJz8g&t=162) we're going to show you what GPTs are, how to&nbsp; use them, how to build them, and then we're&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk4v8yMJz8g&t=167) going to talk about how they'll be distributed and&nbsp; discovered. And then after that, for developers,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk4v8yMJz8g&t=172) we're going to show you how to build these&nbsp; agent-like experiences into your own apps. So&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk4v8yMJz8g&t=177) first, let's look at a few examples. Our partners&nbsp; at Code.org are working hard to expand computer&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk4v8yMJz8g&t=184) science in schools. They've got a curriculum&nbsp; that is used by tens of millions of students&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk4v8yMJz8g&t=189) worldwide. Code.org crafted Lesson Planner&nbsp; GPT to help teachers provide a more engaging&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk4v8yMJz8g&t=195) experience for middle schoolers. If a teacher&nbsp; asks it to explain for loops in a creative way,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk4v8yMJz8g&t=201) it does just that. In this case, it will do it&nbsp; in terms of a video game character. Super easy&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk4v8yMJz8g&t=208) to understand for an eighth grader. As you can&nbsp; see, this GPT brings together Code.org's extensive&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk4v8yMJz8g&t=214) curriculum and expertise and lets teachers adapt&nbsp; it to their needs quickly and easily. Next,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk4v8yMJz8g&t=222) Canva has built a GPT that lets you start&nbsp; designing by describing what you want in&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk4v8yMJz8g&t=226) natural language. If you say make a poster for a&nbsp; Dev Day reception this afternoon, this evening,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk4v8yMJz8g&t=232) and you give it some details. It will generate&nbsp; a few options to start with by hitting Canva's&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk4v8yMJz8g&t=237) APIs. Now, this concept may be familiar to some&nbsp; of you. We've evolved our plug-ins to be custom&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk4v8yMJz8g&t=243) actions for GPTs. You can keep chatting with&nbsp; this to see different iterations, and when&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk4v8yMJz8g&t=249) you see one you like, you can click through&nbsp; to Canva for the full design experience. So,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk4v8yMJz8g&t=255) now, we'd like to show you a GPT live. Zapier&nbsp; has built a GPT that lets you perform actions&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk4v8yMJz8g&t=262) that you want to do daily life. You can use it&nbsp; in your to create custom actions across 6 ,000&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk4v8yMJz8g&t=263) applications to unlock all kinds of integration&nbsp; possibilities. I'd like to introduce Jessica,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk4v8yMJz8g&t=268) one of our solutions architects, who is going&nbsp; to drive this demo. Welcome, Jessica. Thank you,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk4v8yMJz8g&t=274) Sam. Thank you, all. Thank you all for being here.&nbsp; My name is Jessica Shea. I work with partners and&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk4v8yMJz8g&t=284) customers to bring their product to life. And&nbsp; today, I can't wait to show you how hard we've&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk4v8yMJz8g&t=289) been working on this. So, let's get started. So,&nbsp; let's get started. So, let's get started. So, to&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk4v8yMJz8g&t=292) start, where your GPT will live is on this upper&nbsp; left corner. I'm going to start with clicking on&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk4v8yMJz8g&t=298) the Zapier AI actions. And on the right-hand side,&nbsp; you can see that's my calendar for today. So,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk4v8yMJz8g&t=305) it's quite a day. I've already used this before,&nbsp; so it's actually already connected to my calendar.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk4v8yMJz8g&t=310) To start, I can ask what's on my schedule for&nbsp; today. We build GPTs with security in mind. So,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk4v8yMJz8g&t=318) before it performs any action or share data, it&nbsp; will ask for your permission. So, right here,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk4v8yMJz8g&t=324) I'm going to say allowed. So, GPT is designed to&nbsp; take in your instructions, make the decision on&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk4v8yMJz8g&t=332) which capability to call to perform that action,&nbsp; and then execute that for you. So, you can see&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk4v8yMJz8g&t=337) right here, it's already connected to my calendar.&nbsp; It pulls into my information. And then, I've also&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk4v8yMJz8g&t=344) prompted it to identify conflicts on my calendar.&nbsp; So, you can see right here, it actually was&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk4v8yMJz8g&t=349) able to identify that. So, it looks like I have&nbsp; something coming up. So, what if I want to let Sam&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk4v8yMJz8g&t=356) know that I have to leave early? So, right here,&nbsp; I say, let Sam know I got to go. Chasing GPUs. So,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk4v8yMJz8g&t=366) with that, I'm going to swap to my conversation&nbsp; with Sam. And then, I'm going to say, yes, please&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk4v8yMJz8g&t=373) run that. Sam, did you get that? I did. Awesome.&nbsp; So, this is only a glimpse of what is possible,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk4v8yMJz8g&t=390) and I cannot wait to see what you all will build.&nbsp; Thank you, and back to you, Sam. Thank you,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk4v8yMJz8g&t=402) Jessica. So, those are three great examples. In&nbsp; addition to these, there are many more kinds of&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk4v8yMJz8g&t=408) GPTs that people are creating and many, many&nbsp; more that will be created soon. Thank you.
