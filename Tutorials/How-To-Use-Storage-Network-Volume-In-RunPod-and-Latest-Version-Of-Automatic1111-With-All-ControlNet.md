### Video Transcription


- [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=0) Greetings, everyone.

- [00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1) In this tutorial, I will show you how to install and update the latest Automatic1111 Web UI

- [00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=7) on RunPod.

- [00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=8) This includes also Linux systems if you have a local Linux because RunPod uses Linux.

- [00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=14) You see version 1.7.0 with the latest libraries.

- [00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=19) Moreover, I will show how to install automatically TensorRT.

- [00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=23) I will show you how to also download and install all of the ControlNet models.

- [00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=29) Let me show you them.

- [00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=30) So when I select none here, let's say all and let's refresh.

- [00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=35) All of the models of ControlNet are automatically downloaded.

- [00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=39) Everything will be one click for you.

- [00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=41) So with following this tutorial, you will be able to use the latest Automatic1111 Web

- [00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=45) UI on RunPod or any Linux system, any cloud service that supports Linux with the convenience

- [00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=52) of downloading all of the ControlNets automatically, including even the InstantID and IP adapter.

- [00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=60) It will also install the necessary libraries for them to work or the InstantID.

- [00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=65) You will be able to use InstantID as well.

- [00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=69) Let me show you the model.

- [00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=70) Yes, here, for example, this one or this one.

- [00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=73) So this tutorial is the perfect tutorial that you need if you want to use cheap GPUs on

- [00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=80) RunPod with Automatic1111 Web UI.

- [00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=83) One another thing that I'm going to show you is how to have a permanent storage system

- [00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=88) like this with storage network volume, how to mount it, how to reuse it.

- [00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=92) This will be a super tutorial.

- [00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=95) So let's keep watching.

- [00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=96) So everything that you need is shared in this post.

- [00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=100) We will begin with logging in into our RunPod account.

- [00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=105) You can follow this link.

- [00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=106) This link will get me some credits and I can use those credits to do research and do more

- [00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=113) tutorials for you.

- [00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=114) So this is the newest interface that we have. To deploy your pod

- [00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=119) click this pod icon and then click GPU pod.

- [00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=123) In the newest interface, you will see that automatically secure cloud is selected.

- [00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=128) Secure cloud is better than the community cloud sometimes, not every time.

- [00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=133) However, it is also more expensive and the benefit of secure cloud comes from the storage.

- [00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=139) I will show that too.

- [00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=141) So let's open first our community cloud, which is cheaper.

- [00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=146) Select extreme speed from here.

- [00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=147) Then let's pick RTX 3090, which is one of the most affordable price-performance GPUs.

- [00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=155) You can pick anything you wish.

- [00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=157) I will go with this one.

- [00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=159) Okay, at this interface, we are going to select our template.

- [00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=162) This is super important. Type here Stable Diffusion because we want to use Automatic1111 Web UI.

- [00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=169) Therefore, I will use RunPod Stable Diffusion template.

- [00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=173) Then click customize deployment.

- [00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=175) We are going to increase volume disk.

- [00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=177) You can set it anything you wish according to your needs.

- [00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=180) Let's set for 150 gigabytes, set overrides.

- [00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=184) And we also need to give a name.

- [00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=187) Let's say test one is a container image name.

- [00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=190) Okay, everything is set up.

- [00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=192) You see it is how cheap.

- [00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=194) Continue to deploy.

- [00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=195) Okay, you see we got an error as this machine doesn't have so let's deploy again with another

- [00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=201) GPU.

- [00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=202) I think the same settings are deployed.

- [00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=205) All right, and it is getting started.

- [00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=207) This machine has 37 gigabytes RAM.

- [00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=210) And these are the upload and download speeds.

- [00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=213) Now this machine is not permanent, its GPUs may get used when we turn it off.

- [00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=220) Therefore, there is another approach which is storage.

- [00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=223) This storage mode will give you a deployable storage that you can deploy in any available

- [00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=230) pod unlike the other pod setup.

- [00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=233) So there are regions that you need to select and in regions you can see which GPUs are

- [00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=238) usually available.

- [00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=240) Before selecting your region, you can also go to the pods, click GPU pod, and in here

- [00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=247) select secure cloud and look for the data center regions that you are going to deploy.

- [00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=253) For example, US Orion 1.

- [00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=256) And in here I have RTX 4090 available RTX 6000 ADA available, and all others are not

- [00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=264) available as you are seeing.

- [00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=266) So you need to find a region that has available GPUs usually so that you can deploy anytime

- [00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=273) you wish.

- [00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=274) Currently, the available GPUs are getting scarce due to, you know, accelerated AI.

- [00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=281) Therefore, they need to purchase more GPUs.

- [00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=285) Okay, so. So look at the GPUs available and pick your region.

- [00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=290) For this tutorial, let's take a region as let's see, yeah, all is not available.

- [00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=297) Okay, A5000 is available here.

- [00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=301) I still prefer RTX 3090. Non available.

- [00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=304) I wonder if there are any other settings that we can know.

- [00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=308) Let's go with EU-SE-1.

- [00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=310) So to have a storage here, I click storage, click network volume, and I select this one,

- [00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=317) it says this is usually available.

- [00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=319) These are low available.

- [00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=321) Yeah, let's go with this one.

- [00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=323) Here you set your permanent storage.

- [00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=326) Let's set 150 gigabytes, you cannot reduce it, but you can expand it,

- [00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=330) if it be necessary. Give the name you want.

- [00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=333) Let's say test one create.

- [00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=335) Now, we will deploy it to the any available GPU.

- [00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=339) And you can do this anytime you wish.

- [00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=342) So you can also deploy it onto any available GPU.

- [00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=345) Okay, I will deploy it on RTX A5000, which is a decent GPU, you see this is 44 cents,

- [00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=352) and the community cloud was 26 cents.

- [00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=356) Okay, let's deploy.

- [00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=358) And also select your template here as this one because these will be used to continue

- [00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=363) deploy.

- [00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=364) The first deployment of the network storage may take more time.

- [00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=368) And you see this machine has 50 gigabytes RAM, the other one is only 26 cents.

- [00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=374) And it is still not.

- [00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=375) Yeah, looks like this didn't work.

- [00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=378) Maybe because we changed the name.

- [00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=380) So let's delete this one and deploy again.

- [00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=383) Let's go to the pods, GPU pod.

- [00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=386) And here let's select community cloud, from here RTX 3090.

- [00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=391) Maybe we shouldn't change this one.

- [00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=393) Yeah, probably this was the reason why it was failed.

- [00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=396) So we need to keep it as it is. Set the volume disk, set overrides.

- [00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=401) Okay, so they should match both.

- [00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=404) This was my mistake and deploy and it is getting deployed as you are seeing.

- [00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=410) Okay, so the private network started and you see secure cloud has much higher download

- [00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=416) speed and upload speed and the hard drive speed.

- [00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=419) But these may not be very dependable.

- [00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=421) Sometimes I saw that community cloud is working much faster than the secure cloud.

- [00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=426) So this machine has terminate option, because this is a private volume.

- [00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=432) So when you terminate it, it just close your pod and you can deploy it to any other machine.

- [00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=438) However, on community cloud, we have stop option, because when we stop our pod, it

- [00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=443) will just stopped.

- [00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=445) And then when there are available GPUs, we can start again.

- [00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=448) So this has two options.

- [00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=450) When I stop it, it will not get deleted, it will stay like this.

- [00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=454) And then I can terminate and this will delete my data permanently.

- [00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=459) However, on the secure cloud, when I click terminate, you see it is gone.

- [00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=464) However, my data is not gone.

- [00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=466) It is still inside here.

- [00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=468) And until I delete it, it will remain as it is.

- [00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=471) So let's deploy it again on any available GPU like this one again.

- [00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=476) So just deploy.

- [00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=477) Okay, now time to set up.

- [00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=480) So let's see, let's start this.

- [00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=482) By the way, you see these are the available GPUs.

- [00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=484) If this becomes zero, you have to move your data into another pod when you are using

- [00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=490) community cloud or non-storage secure cloud.

- [00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=494) So let's start it.

- [00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=495) Both are getting started. With storage

- [00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=498) another advantage is that you can also rent multiple GPUs if they are available.

- [00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=503) However, with the community cloud, you have to pick your maximum number of GPUs at the

- [00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=510) beginning.

- [00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=511) So you see, let's go back to the community cloud.

- [00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=513) And when I am going to first time deploy, I need to select my maximum number of GPUs

- [00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=518) because it is not getting increased at a later time, even if you stop your pod.

- [00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=522) Okay, both pods are started, let's connect to their Jupyter lab, you need to wait until

- [00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=528) Jupyter lab becomes available.

- [00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=530) Sometimes these may still show orange, but it may connect probably this is one of that

- [00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=535) times.

- [00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=536) So this was our community cloud.

- [00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=538) And this is our secure cloud. The setup and everything is exactly the same.

- [00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=543) It doesn't change. In here

- [00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=546) I have prepared an amazing scripts for you.

- [00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=550) So let's download the RunPod Auto11 version one zip file.

- [00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=555) And let's extract it into any folder you wish because we will just use the scripts inside

- [00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=560) them.

- [00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=561) And the scripts are here.

- [00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=562) As you are seeing, I have prepared RunPod instructions, you can also read this, and

- [00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=568) you will see everything here as well.

- [00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=570) So let's start the instructions.

- [00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=572) Okay, we got everything here.

- [00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=574) So okay, this still didn't start.

- [00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=576) Let's start it.

- [00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=577) First of all, this template permanently restarts the web UI.

- [00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=583) But we don't want that to happen.

- [00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=585) So therefore we will override the relauncher.py file.

- [00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=589) So let's upload the downloaded relauncher.py file.

- [00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=593) Okay, I go to the downloads, and I select relauncher.py file, and it will ask me to

- [00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=599) overwrite this is super important overwrite.

- [00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=601) After overwrite, if you double click, you will see that it becomes like this.

- [00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=606) After this operation, you need to restart your pod.

- [00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=609) Let's also do this to the other one as well.

- [00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=612) Okay, this is still not started.

- [00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=614) We can see the logs.

- [00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=616) Let's just wait a little bit more.

- [00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=618) Okay, it is also starting. Then how we are going to restart. You see in here just click

- [00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=623) and restart pod and it will restart the pod.

- [00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=626) This is just one time necessary.

- [00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=627) We will do this on the secure pod as well.

- [00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=630) So it is here, you can also alternatively drag and drop like this into this folder and

- [00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=636) overwrite it will do the same operation.

- [00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=638) Then we will also restart this one as well.

- [00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=641) So let's just restart it.

- [00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=643) Okay, this pod probably restarted.

- [00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=645) Now for installation, what we need to do is we need to just drag and drop files here like

- [00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=652) this, then open a new terminal.

- [00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=654) Now you can read this file very carefully.

- [00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=657) I have separate installers and updaters.

- [00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=660) For example, if you just want to update Automatic1111 web UI to the latest version, you just execute

- [00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=666) install latest auto 1111.sh file.

- [00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=670) However, if you want to install everything, then we have install everything file, this

- [00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=676) one just copy this, open a new terminal, you can click this plus icon terminal, copy paste

- [00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=682) and hit enter, and it will do everything automatically for you.

- [00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=686) What will this do?

- [00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=688) This will install latest Automatic1111 web UI.

- [00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=692) This will install the latest ControlNet extension.

- [00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=696) This will install the InsightFace library so you can use IP adapter Face ID, or you

- [00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=702) can use InstantID.

- [00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=703) This will download the models, which models?

- [00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=707) This will download realistic vision fp16 VAE fix, playground version two, hyper realism

- [00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=714) version three, and this will download all of the ControlNet models available, 52 models.

- [00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=720) This will also download 275 amazing focus styles.

- [00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=726) So this is an amazing secret that I have prepared.

- [00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=729) Just you execute that and you just wait.

- [00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=732) Let's do the same for the secure cloud as well like this.

- [00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=737) So the difference of secure cloud is once we set it we can deploy it to any pod we

- [00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=742) wish and just execute and just wait.

- [00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=745) You will also get this permission denied, it is not important, we are killing automatically

- [00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=750) started web UI.

- [00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=752) So you can see that GPU memory usage is dropped to zero percent.

- [00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=756) This is also important when you are doing training. You have to kill automatically started

- [00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=761) web UI.

- [00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=762) And for that to work, you need to change the relauncher.py file here. It is super important

- [00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=771) because if you don't make that change, even if you kill the web UI, it will automatically

- [00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=776) start again.

- [00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=777) So then just relax and wait for everything to be installed and downloaded.

- [00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=782) The download speeds are amazing, currently over 100 megabytes for the community cloud

- [00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=789) and over 200 megabytes for the secure cloud.

- [00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=792) When you look closely, it will show you how many models are automatically downloaded,

- [00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=798) 22 over 52.

- [00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=800) When we look at the secure cloud, we can see that 26 over 52.

- [00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=806) So this is extremely convenient for you to use.

- [00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=809) After all models downloaded, it will start installing the newest packages and the newest

- [00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=815) Automatic 1111 Web UI.

- [00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=817) You see it is also automatically installing the InsightFace, which is a library that is

- [00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=822) necessary for face transfer applications.

- [00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=826) If you also need additional extensions, just message me from Patreon, and hopefully, I

- [00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=831) will also include them into the installations.

- [00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=834) This is secure cloud.

- [00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=835) It is a little bit faster.

- [00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=837) The community cloud is still trying to catch up with the secure cloud.

- [00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=842) But remember, secure cloud is 44 cents and community cloud is 26 cents per hour.

- [00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=849) Okay, another option, which is even cheaper, is bidding in the community cloud.

- [00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=855) So let's click GPU pod. In here

- [00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=857) let's select community cloud extreme, and let's go.

- [00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=860) Let's say A6000 GPU or maybe 3090 GPU.

- [00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=867) Let's go with 3090. In here

- [00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=869) you see on-demand non-interruptible.

- [00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=872) If you make it spot bidding interruptible, it drops to 19 cents per hour.

- [00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=877) This is ultra-cheap.

- [00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=879) In this mode, if someone overbids you, let's say they selected on-demand, and there is

- [00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=886) no other available GPU, so they will take away your GPU, and you will be out of GPU on your

- [00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=893) pod, your pod will continue working.

- [00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=895) However without GPU, so you will get errors

- [00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=898) if you are doing a GPU-dependent work. You will not lose any data unless you are processing

- [00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=904) some data, and you have to save at that time or something.

- [00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=908) So this is another cheaper option.

- [00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=910) Okay, everything is getting installed on both of the pods.

- [00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=915) You see version 1.7.0 installing the latest requirements.

- [00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=919) The same is happening here as well.

- [00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=922) You will also get this dependency message.

- [00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=925) Don't worry, it will work.

- [00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=927) Currently, it is installing the necessary libraries for TensorRT.

- [00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=931) TensorRT is another amazing feature and it speeds up the image generation about 70% without

- [00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=939) any quality loss.

- [00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=941) 70%.

- [00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=942) However, for each model, you have to compile a TensorRT, but it worths if you are going

- [00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=948) to generate hundreds or thousands of images, it is extremely useful.

- [00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=952) I have a full tutorial for that the links are here and on the channel.

- [00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=957) Let's say you want to close your server and use it again.

- [00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=961) So to do that, first of all, if you are using the community cloud or private cloud without

- [00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=967) storage, you need to have a GPU available.

- [00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=971) So when I click stop, it will stop this server.

- [00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=975) This is the community cloud.

- [00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=976) Then if I want to start again, I just click here start and select the GPU if available.

- [00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=981) If not available, I won't be able to.

- [00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=983) If I want to completely delete it, I have to use terminate.

- [00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=986) If you use terminate on this pod, it will delete all of your data; all will be gone.

- [00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=992) What about the storage that we have?

- [00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=994) You will click this terminate, but it will not terminate the pod; it will not delete

- [00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1000) your data.

- [00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1001) It says this will remove your pod configuration.

- [00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1005) So let's click yes, and it is gone.

- [00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1007) But the all data remains here.

- [00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1009) Now I can deploy again into any available pod.

- [00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1012) I can also choose a better GPU from here.

- [00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1016) For example, I can deploy on an A6000 like this, and I will start using it with my all

- [00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1022) data.

- [00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1023) However, if I delete this pod, this is the community cloud, all the data will be gone

- [00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1029) forever.

- [00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1030) Let me show you; I will click terminate and gone.

- [00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1032) I cannot recover back any of my data.

- [00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1035) So this is the major difference between using the community cloud or secure cloud without

- [00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1042) storage; storage only works with the secure cloud.

- [00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1046) And how you will run it again.

- [00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1048) So I will connect to the Jupyter lab one more time, then to re-start it:

- [00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1054) when you go to the very bottom of the instructions, you will see that I have this command.

- [00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1059) This will kill the automatically started web UI and start a new one.

- [00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1064) So let's copy this.

- [00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1065) Let's just wait for the Jupyter lab to load because we moved our data, so it will take

- [00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1071) some time for our data to be synchronizing with the new pod, new machine.

- [00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1078) So this is a shared storage that is between different machines.

- [00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1082) Okay, let's try again.

- [00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1084) Yeah, we need to wait a sometime, synchronization may take some time.

- [00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1088) Okay, let's try again.

- [00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1089) I think synchronization has been completed.

- [00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1092) You will also see the VRAM usage once it's loaded; it started.

- [00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1097) You can also wait here to load some memory.

- [00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1100) Let's connect to the Jupyter lab.

- [00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1102) Let's copy the command one more time.

- [00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1104) Yeah, Jupyter interface loaded.

- [00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1107) Let's open a terminal, copy paste the command, and the previously automatically started Web UI

- [00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1112) instance is killed.

- [00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1114) And now it is starting a new instance.

- [00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1116) The advantage of this technique is that you can see whatever is happening on the terminal.

- [00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1122) If you depend on the initially started web UI, you can't see anything.

- [00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1126) So this is a much better way of doing it.

- [00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1129) By the way, if you have noticed, I have removed the skip install argument from the web UI

- [00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1136) arguments.

- [00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1137) So with this way, you can also install other and newer extensions as well.

- [00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1143) Without removing that skip install argument, you won't be able to.

- [00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1147) Moreover, enable insecure extension access is added as an argument.

- [00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1152) So this also allows you to install any extension from the web UI interface itself.

- [00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1159) Once the Automatic1111 Web UI has started, you will see that it is running on a local

- [00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1164) URL like this.

- [00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1165) Don't click this; it won't work.

- [00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1167) You need to connect with the HTTP proxy port, and it will start.

- [00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1171) You can also alternatively edit the web UI user.sh file, which is here, web UI user.sh,

- [00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1179) and in here, you can add --share.

- [00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1180) This way, it will also give you a Gradio share live link that you can use anywhere,

- [00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1186) even on your phone or on another computer.

- [00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1190) And the interface started, and the rest is the same; you can just use it as you wish.

- [00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1194) So this is the way of using the network volume, how to use it.

- [00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1198) So I terminate and then I can deploy to any other pod.

- [00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1202) This applies to anything and everything.

- [00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1205) It is not only specific to Stable Diffusion web UI; you can use this technique on literally

- [00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1212) everything, on all of my other scripts or whatever you are running for.

- [00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1216) Alright, the installation of the secure cloud is completed, you see running on a local URL.

- [00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1223) So to connect it, we will use the proxy connection.

- [00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1228) Let's go to the secure cloud instance.

- [00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1230) And in here, you see it also started using GPU.

- [00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1234) So I will click the connect to HTTP port, just wait for it to load.

- [00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1239) And we got the interface.

- [00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1241) You see it selected Hyper-Realism; TensorRT is installed.

- [00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1245) We also have the ControlNet; let me show you the ControlNet is here.

- [00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1250) And when I click here, you see all of the models are automatically downloaded and ready

- [00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1256) to use.

- [00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1257) This is amazing

- [00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1258) believe me. This will save a lot of time of yours.

- [00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1260) So for example, let's try to use this.

- [00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1264) We can use this as a line art.

- [00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1267) Let's see.

- [00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1268) Okay, probably we don't need to process; but we can process.

- [00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1271) Okay, line art standard from white and black and white SD 1.5 selected is SD1.5 model.

- [00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1278) An amazing flying creature.

- [00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1281) Let's try 1024 1024 and hit generate.

- [00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1287) If you don't know how to use control that I have a huge tutorial the link is here, so

- [00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1290) you can watch and learn it, and we got the ControlNet output.

- [00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1295) This may not be the best setting because I don't remember; maybe we need to not select

- [00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1300) any preprocessor here.

- [00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1302) And let's see the output.

- [00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1305) Okay, yeah, let's try like this way.

- [00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1307) It should be pretty fast too.

- [00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1309) Yes, let's see the generated image.

- [00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1312) Okay, yeah, without preprocessor, it didn't work.

- [00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1314) So we need a preprocessor.

- [00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1316) So you can try different preprocessors and see which one is working best.

- [00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1322) And let's see the other one is, yes, it is also completed.

- [00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1326) So we can also start using the community cloud.

- [00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1328) Now, there is one important thing that I need to show you; recently, ControlNet added the

- [00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1337) InstantID and IP adapter face ID; using them is not straightforward.

- [00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1341) So I added the links of them to here.

- [00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1343) I suggest you watch this to learn how to use them.

- [00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1347) For example, to be able to use InstantID, you need to make the first control that unit

- [00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1353) like this and the second one like this.

- [00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1356) However, from my testing, it is not working very well.

- [00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1359) So let's select the SDXL version from here.

- [00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1363) And let's upload face here.

- [00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1366) Okay, let's use the Arnold Schwarzenegger, perhaps.

- [00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1369) Yes, this one.

- [00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1371) And from here, it says you to select InstantID face embedding and IP adapter InstantID.

- [00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1378) Okay, I will do that.

- [00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1380) So first of all, let's click the InstantID.

- [00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1383) And in here, let's select face embedding.

- [00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1386) And in here, IP adapter InstantID.

- [00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1387) So this was the first ControlNet unit; we have selected it.

- [00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1392) And these are default settings.

- [00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1395) Let's click the preview if it will show the preview.

- [00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1398) I don't know if the preview is working or not.

- [00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1400) With my scripts, you can also watch what is happening in this terminal because we are

- [00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1406) starting them from the terminal.

- [00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1407) By the way, you will also get this attribute error.

- [00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1410) This is the error of TensorRT; I think this will get fixed when they update the TensorRT.

- [00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1416) So the preview is getting.

- [00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1418) Yes, it is downloading the necessary models.

- [00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1420) Okay, we should get the preview in a moment.

- [00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1424) It downloaded the necessary models for the InsightFace library.

- [00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1429) And yes, we got the preprocessor output.

- [00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1432) I think it is not very important.

- [00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1433) So let's also select, for example, this pose, okay, this will be our pose, I think.

- [00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1439) So here we select IP adapter, and we select, okay, we select InstantID, sorry, key points.

- [00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1447) So this will be our face transferred into another one.

- [00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1451) And in here, we will select IP adapter InstantID SDXL, let's verify from here, ControlNet

- [00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1457) InstantID, InstantID face points, okay, so this will be face key points and ControlNet

- [00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1463) IstantID.

- [00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1464) Alright, and let's define just a man.

- [00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1467) Okay, and let's see what we will get.

- [00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1469) I will show you same with my own developer InstantID gradio and I am still developing

- [00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1475) it hopefully it will become even better.

- [00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1477) The link is here to install it.

- [00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1480) You can see one click automatic installer for the InstantID so I will just start it

- [00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1485) it is in my R drive inside.

- [00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1488) Let's see InstantID.

- [00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1489) Okay, let's start the web UI.

- [00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1492) Okay, let's go with high VRAM and everything.

- [00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1496) And let's see the result.

- [00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1497) Okay, so this is the result we got.

- [00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1499) Let's see if we have any errors.

- [00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1502) No, it doesn't show any error.

- [00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1504) And let's try again.

- [00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1506) So we enabled we selected key InstantID face key points InstantID control.

- [00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1512) Okay, it is enabled.

- [00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1514) And here we got the other one face embedding.

- [00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1517) IP adapter InstantID and the key points and control InstantID.

- [00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1523) This is the output we got.

- [00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1525) And in here, let's see if there is any error.

- [00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1528) Okay, I think we got an error.

- [00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1530) Okay, it says that yeah, it is it is still seeing another ControlNet it says. InstantID.

- [00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1537) No, it is looking accurate.

- [00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1539) InstantID let's try again.

- [00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1541) Okay, it think it taught that for some reason we have selected another ControlNet model

- [00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1546) but we didn't select so it is loading IP Adapter InstantID SDXL ControlNet model

- [00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1551) IP Adapter InstantID SDXL. Okay, everything is loaded.

- [00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1554) Meanwhile, my gradio also loaded.

- [00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1556) So let's load the same images and see what we will get.

- [00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1561) I'm just waiting for this one to be completed first.

- [00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1563) Yeah, it is loading everything accurately right now.

- [00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1566) Okay, ControlNet, using preprocessor, using InstantID face keypoints.

- [00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1570) Okay, generating images.

- [00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1572) This is not important.

- [00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1573) As I said, this is for the TensorRT error.

- [00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1577) I hope they fix it sooner.

- [00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1578) Okay, it is also pretty slow 1.76 seconds. In my Gradio

- [00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1584) let's try like this way.

- [00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1586) So I will transfer the face of Muhammad Ali, this is an upscaled by my upscaler.

- [00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1593) This is an upscaled image with the SUPIR which is a newest upscaler which is best I just

- [00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1600) made a tutorial for it.

- [00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1602) And let's use that face.

- [00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1604) And as a pose, let's use the Arnold Schwarzenegger this pose.

- [00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1608) Okay, so this will be our reference and this will be the face transfer.

- [00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1612) So let's say a man holding a sword and we have amazing features you can apply LoRAs

- [00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1619) you can select any models.

- [00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1621) Hopefully I will make a tutorial for this.

- [00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1623) So I will be by using the default model.

- [00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1627) And to get this pose, we can enable Canny or Depth.

- [00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1632) Let's try with Depth and submit.

- [00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1635) I hope my VRAM is sufficient.

- [00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1637) I didn't enable the low VRAM.

- [00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1639) And this is the output we got.

- [00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1641) Yeah.

- [00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1642) So I tried to make this I don't know this is working very, very bad.

- [00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1646) We are following the instructions they provided but it is not working good.

- [00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1650) Maybe let's try with control weight or maybe let's try with pixel perfect.

- [00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1654) So I make the pixel perfect.

- [00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1656) And is this also pixel perfect selected?

- [00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1659) Yes, let's try again.

- [00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1661) And let's see the result of my gradio I hope I don't get into shared VRAM because it will

- [00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1665) take too much time.

- [00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1666) By the way, this is another important thing.

- [00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1668) If you get shared VRAM as I am having right now, it will become 20 times slower.

- [00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1675) So you need to reduce your VRAM usage.

- [00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1678) Since I am recording right now.

- [00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1679) Okay, we may have an issue.

- [00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1682) Yes, yeah, my FPS has been dropped.

- [00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1685) This is bad.

- [00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1686) Okay, it turns out that I was also having open SUPIR upscaler.

- [00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1692) So it was using my extra VRAM.

- [00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1694) I closed it and shared VRAM has dropped.

- [00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1698) Now it started processing very fast.

- [00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1700) So if your GPU starts using shared VRAM, it will become 20 times or more slower.

- [00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1707) Be careful with that.

- [00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1709) We got the output of the ControlNet inside Automatic1111 Web UI with the InstantID and

- [00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1714) this is another output we got it is just horrific.

- [00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1717) So let's try to make the ControlNet weight like 0.5 and 0.5 and try again.

- [00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1724) And this is the output we got with the InstantID that we have.

- [00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1729) If you want to get a perfect match, then you need to do is upload same person different

- [00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1736) pose.

- [00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1737) So it will also match the face.

- [00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1738) What I mean is let me show you.

- [00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1740) So here my photo.

- [00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1742) Now, here my another photo, since the face will match, by the way, these are both DreamBooth

- [00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1748) generated images.

- [00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1750) Now I can generate much better matching pictures.

- [00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1754) So let's say a man standing on a chair.

- [00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1759) Okay, by the way, if we make this Canny it will not work very well.

- [00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1762) Let's make this also Depth and try again.

- [00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1765) Let's see this one.

- [00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1766) Yeah, this is still not working.

- [00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1767) I don't know how we can make this one working.

- [00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1770) I am following the instructions written on the ControlNet.

- [00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1773) This is official repository and this is the official thread where they have explained

- [00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1779) how to use InstantID.

- [00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1781) It is simply not working.

- [00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1784) And this is the output I have.

- [00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1785) You see, it is pretty accurate.

- [00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1787) It may even get more accurate depending on whatever you choose.

- [00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1791) So if you delete this option, it will use this also as a ControlNet.

- [00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1795) For example, you can use this as a pose and let's say a man wearing an armor. Currently

- [00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1803) the watercolor style is selected.

- [00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1806) So you can also try other ones.

- [00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1808) Let's try vibrant color and try to generate. You can play with it and get very accurate

- [00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1815) faces.

- [00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1816) Very accurate results.

- [00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1817) Let me show you one of the results that I have got.

- [00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1820) I have shown in the Patreon post, which is let me show you. Here.

- [00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1826) So you see, I have used GlowNeon XL V1 LoRA model and I have used SDXL base

- [00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1834) model.

- [00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1835) This was the input image. I set a man lightning.

- [00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1839) And this is the output I have got.

- [00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1841) I didn't select any ControlNet for this example.

- [00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1844) And it worked perfect.

- [00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1845) So you need to play with this to understand how it works.

- [00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1848) You see, this is also pretty accurate.

- [00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1850) But in here, we cannot get anything like it.

- [00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1853) I don't know why.

- [00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1854) Let's upload the same picture to demonstrate again.

- [00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1858) So I will use the same picture in both of the images.

- [00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1862) And let's say a man drawing in 3D CGI, or I don't know, we can say anything.

- [00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1871) Let's try again.

- [00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1872) It is just simply not working as supposed to be.

- [00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1875) I think it is also slower than my configuration.

- [00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1879) It is taking really high time.

- [00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1881) Alright, we can play with anything.

- [00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1883) We have some you see the styles here.

- [00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1886) For example, let's try neon and try again.

- [00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1890) And this also generating. Okay, this is the output we are getting and the ControlNet

- [00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1894) weight is just 0.5.

- [00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1895) When I make this one, it will become even worse.

- [00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1899) And we have selected face key points.

- [00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1902) InstantID SDXL, we selected face ID embedding, IP adapter, InstantID SDXL.

- [00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1907) We made everything true.

- [00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1909) And you see, it is like even it is not even these pictures.

- [00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1913) There is certainly some error someplace.

- [00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1917) Maybe it was using preview.

- [00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1918) I don't know.

- [00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1919) Both of the ControlNets are enabled.

- [00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1921) Let's try again.

- [00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1922) And here, this is working amazing.

- [00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1924) You can see. So this is everything for today.

- [00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1937) And let's just wait this one too.

- [00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1939) Okay, this time we got an image that is actually like similar.

- [00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1944) Yeah, somewhat similar.

- [00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1945) So we uploaded the same person.

- [00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1948) And we said a man drawing in 3D CGI, it tried drawing a man.

- [00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1952) And yeah, I can see some resemblance, but still nothing like the standalone gradio.

- [00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1956) Hopefully, see you in another amazing tutorial video.

- [00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1957) I will hopefully make a tutorial video about InstantID as well with better configuration

- [00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qf4x3-DFf4&t=1958) and settings.
