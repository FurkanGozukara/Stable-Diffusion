Summary of Google IO 2024 Keynote

Introduction and AI Journey

At the Google IO 2024, the keynote commenced with a warm welcome to the thousands of developers present at Shoreline, along with the millions joining virtually worldwide. The keynote humorously likened Google IO to a tech version of a concert tour, albeit with fewer costume changes. The keynote set the stage for Google’s current focus, which they term the "Gemini era," marking a significant shift towards AI-centric innovations.

Google emphasized its decade-long investment in AI, highlighting their advancements across various layers such as research, product development, and infrastructure. The keynote underscored that despite significant progress, the field of AI is still in its nascent stage, brimming with opportunities for creators, developers, startups, and the broader tech community. This era, driven by the Gemini AI models, aims to harness these opportunities and push the boundaries of what AI can achieve.

Gemini AI Models

A year prior, Google had introduced Gemini, a frontier model designed to be inherently multimodal—capable of processing and reasoning across text, images, video, code, and more. This represented a substantial leap towards transforming any input into any output, heralding a new generation of AI capabilities. Since its introduction, Gemini models have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance across various multimodal benchmarks.

Two months after the initial introduction, Google unveiled the Gemini 1.5 Pro, which marked a breakthrough in handling long contexts. This model can manage 1 million tokens in production consistently, outperforming other large-scale foundation models. To democratize access to these advancements, Google has integrated Gemini models into a wide array of tools, attracting over 1.5 million developers who utilize them for debugging code, gaining insights, and building advanced AI applications.

Integration Across Google Products

The keynote highlighted how Gemini’s capabilities have been integrated into Google’s product ecosystem, enhancing experiences across search, photos, workspace, Android, and more. Notably, all of Google’s 2 billion user products now leverage Gemini models, and new user experiences have been introduced, particularly on mobile platforms. The Gemini Advanced app, available on Android and iOS, provides access to the latest models, with over 1 million users signing up within three months of its launch.

Transformations in Google Search

One of the most significant transformations driven by Gemini has been in Google Search. Over the past year, the search-generated experience has handled billions of queries, enabling users to search in novel ways, including using photos and complex queries. The revamped search experience, featuring AI Overviews, is being rolled out in the U.S., with plans to expand to more countries soon. This new search experience not only increases search usage but also enhances user satisfaction.

Enhancements in Google Photos

Google Photos, launched nearly nine years ago, has become a vital tool for organizing memories, with over 6 billion photos and videos uploaded daily. With Gemini, searching through these vast collections has become more intuitive. Users can now ask complex queries, such as identifying a license plate number from photos or tracking a child’s swimming progress. This functionality, termed "ask photos," will roll out in the summer, allowing users to search their memories in a more profound way.

Multimodality and Long Context

Gemini’s multimodal capabilities mean it can handle various types of inputs—text, images, audio, video—and find connections between them. This expands the range of questions users can ask and the answers they can receive.

### Video Transcription


- [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbTz-ScdFiw&t=0) Okay guys, let's see the newest Google Keynotes of the Google IO 2024 together.

- [00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbTz-ScdFiw&t=30) Welcome to Google IO. It's great to have all of you with us. We have a few thousand developers

- [00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbTz-ScdFiw&t=37) with us here today at Shoreline. Millions more are joining virtually around the world.

- [00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbTz-ScdFiw&t=43) Thanks to everyone for being here. For those of you who haven't seen IO before, it's basically

- [00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbTz-ScdFiw&t=49) Google's version of the era store, but with fewer costume changes. At Google though, we

- [00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbTz-ScdFiw&t=58) are fully in our Gemini era. You'll hear a lot about that today. Before we get into it,

- [00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbTz-ScdFiw&t=64) I want to reflect on this moment we are in. We've been investing in AI for more than a decade

- [00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbTz-ScdFiw&t=71) and innovating at every layer of the stack. Research, product, infrastructure. We're going

- [00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbTz-ScdFiw&t=77) to talk about it all today. Still, we are in the very early days of the AI platform shift.

- [00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbTz-ScdFiw&t=83) We see so much opportunity ahead for creators, for developers, for startups,

- [00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbTz-ScdFiw&t=90) for everyone. Helping to drive those opportunities is what our Gemini era is all about.

- [00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbTz-ScdFiw&t=97) So let's get started. A year ago on this stage, we first shared our plans for Gemini,

- [00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbTz-ScdFiw&t=104) a frontier model built to be natively multimodal from the very beginning that could reason across

- [00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbTz-ScdFiw&t=110) text, images, video, code, and more. It's a big step in turning any input into any output,

- [00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbTz-ScdFiw&t=118) an IO for a new generation. Since then, we introduced the first Gemini models

- [00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbTz-ScdFiw&t=125) our most capable yet. They demonstrated state of the art performance on every multimodal benchmark,

- [00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbTz-ScdFiw&t=132) and that was just the beginning. Two months later, we introduced Gemini 1.5 Pro,

- [00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbTz-ScdFiw&t=138) delivering a big breakthrough in long context. It can run 1 million tokens in production

- [00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbTz-ScdFiw&t=144) consistently, more than any other large-scale foundation model yet.

- [00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbTz-ScdFiw&t=150) We want everyone to benefit from what Gemini can do. So we have worked quickly to share these

- [00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbTz-ScdFiw&t=155) advances with all of you. Today, more than 1.5 million developers use Gemini models across our

- [00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbTz-ScdFiw&t=163) tools. You're using it to debug code, get new insights, and build the next generation of AI

- [00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbTz-ScdFiw&t=170) applications. We've also been bringing Gemini's breakthrough capabilities across our products in

- [00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbTz-ScdFiw&t=176) powerful ways. We'll show examples today across search, photos, workspace, Android, and more.

- [00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbTz-ScdFiw&t=185) Today, all of our 2 billion user products use Gemini, and we've introduced new experiences too,

- [00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbTz-ScdFiw&t=192) including on mobile, where people can interact with Gemini directly through the app.

- [00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbTz-ScdFiw&t=197) Now available on Android and iOS, and through Gemini Advanced, which provides access to our

- [00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbTz-ScdFiw&t=204) most capable models. Over 1 million people have signed up to try it in just three months,

- [00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbTz-ScdFiw&t=210) and it continues to show strong momentum. One of the most exciting transformations with Gemini

- [00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbTz-ScdFiw&t=216) has been in Google Search. In the past year, we've answered billions of queries as part of

- [00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbTz-ScdFiw&t=222) our search-generated experience. People are using it to search in entirely new ways,

- [00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbTz-ScdFiw&t=228) and asking new types of questions, longer and more complex queries, even searching with photos,

- [00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbTz-ScdFiw&t=236) and getting back the best the web has to offer. We've been testing this experience outside of

- [00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbTz-ScdFiw&t=241) labs, and we're encouraged to see not only an increase in search usage, but also an increase

- [00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbTz-ScdFiw&t=248) in user satisfaction. I'm excited to announce that we will begin launching this fully revamped

- [00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbTz-ScdFiw&t=254) experience, AI Overviews, to everyone in the U.S. this week, and we'll bring it to more countries

- [00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbTz-ScdFiw&t=260) soon. There's so much innovation happening in Search. Thanks to Gemini, we can create much

- [00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbTz-ScdFiw&t=273) more powerful search experiences, including within our products. Let me show you an example in Google

- [00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbTz-ScdFiw&t=279) Photos. We launched Google Photos almost nine years ago. Since then, people have used it to

- [00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbTz-ScdFiw&t=285) organize their most important memories. Today, that amounts to more than 6 billion photos and

- [00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbTz-ScdFiw&t=292) videos uploaded every single day. And people love using photos to search across their life.

- [00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbTz-ScdFiw&t=299) With Gemini, you're making that a whole lot easier. Say you're at a parking station ready to

- [00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbTz-ScdFiw&t=304) pay, but you can't recall your license plate number. Before, you could search photos for

- [00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbTz-ScdFiw&t=310) keywords, then scroll through years worth of photos looking for the right one. Now,

- [00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbTz-ScdFiw&t=316) you can simply ask photos. It knows the cars that appear often. It triangulates which one is yours

- [00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbTz-ScdFiw&t=323) and just tells you the license plate number. And ask photos can also help you search your

- [00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbTz-ScdFiw&t=334) memories in a deeper way. For example, you might be reminiscing about your daughter,

- [00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbTz-ScdFiw&t=339) Lucia's early milestones. You can ask photos, when did Lucia learn to swim?

- [00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbTz-ScdFiw&t=348) no way they were able to achieve this. I wanted to test its technical skills.

- [00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbTz-ScdFiw&t=354) So I uploaded a line chart. It was temperatures between Tokyo and Berlin and how they vary across

- [00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbTz-ScdFiw&t=361) the 12 months of the year. So I got in there and I threw in the Python library that I was really

- [00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbTz-ScdFiw&t=366) struggling with. And I just asked it a simple question. And it nailed it. It could find specific

- [00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbTz-ScdFiw&t=376) references to comments in the code and specific requests that people had made and other issues

- [00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbTz-ScdFiw&t=381) that people had had, but then suggest a fix for it that related to what I was working on.

- [00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbTz-ScdFiw&t=389) I immediately tried to kind of crash it. So I took, you know, four or five research papers I

- [00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbTz-ScdFiw&t=395) had on my desktop. And it's a mind blowing experience when you add so much text and then

- [00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbTz-ScdFiw&t=401) you see the kind of amount of tokens you add is not even at half the capacity. It felt a little

- [00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbTz-ScdFiw&t=407) bit like Christmas because you saw things kind of peppered up to the top of your feed about,

- [00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbTz-ScdFiw&t=411) like, oh, wow, I built this thing or, oh, it's doing this. And I would have never expected.

- [00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbTz-ScdFiw&t=416) Can I shoot a video of my possessions and turn that into a searchable database?

- [00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbTz-ScdFiw&t=421) So I ran to my bookshelf and I shot a video just panning my camera along the bookshelf.

- [00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbTz-ScdFiw&t=426) And I fed the video into the model. It gave me the titles and authors of the books,

- [00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbTz-ScdFiw&t=431) even though the authors weren't visible on those book spines. And on the bookshelf,

- [00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbTz-ScdFiw&t=435) there was a squirrel nutcracker sat in front of the book truncating the title.

- [00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbTz-ScdFiw&t=439) You could just see the word site C and it still guessed the correct book.

- [00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbTz-ScdFiw&t=443) The range of things you can do with that is almost unlimited.

- [00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbTz-ScdFiw&t=445) So at that point for me, it was just like a click, like, this is it.

- [00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbTz-ScdFiw&t=449) I thought like I had like a super part in my hands.

- [00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbTz-ScdFiw&t=452) It was poetry. It was beautiful. I was so happy.

- [00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbTz-ScdFiw&t=455) It just this this is going to be amazing. This is this is going to help people.

- [00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbTz-ScdFiw&t=460) This is kind of where the future of language models are going.

- [00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbTz-ScdFiw&t=463) Personalized to you, not because you trained it to be personal to you,

- [00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbTz-ScdFiw&t=468) but personal to you because you can give it such a vast understanding of who you are.

- [00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbTz-ScdFiw&t=482) We've been rolling out Gemini 1.5 Pro with long context and preview over the last few months.

- [00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbTz-ScdFiw&t=488) We made a series of quality improvements across translation, coding and reasoning.

- [00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbTz-ScdFiw&t=493) You'll see these updates reflected in the model starting today.

- [00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbTz-ScdFiw&t=497) I'm excited to announce that we are bringing this improved version of Gemini 1.5 Pro

- [00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbTz-ScdFiw&t=502) to all developers globally.

- [00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbTz-ScdFiw&t=511) In addition, today, Gemini 1.5 Pro with 1 million context

- [00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbTz-ScdFiw&t=516) is now directly available for consumers in Gemini Advanced and can be used across 35 languages.

- [00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbTz-ScdFiw&t=524) 1 million tokens is opening up entirely new possibilities.

- [00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbTz-ScdFiw&t=529) It's exciting, but I think we can push ourselves even further.

- [00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbTz-ScdFiw&t=533) So today we are expanding the context window to 2 million tokens.

- [00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbTz-ScdFiw&t=538) We are making it available for developers in private preview.

- [00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbTz-ScdFiw&t=549) It's amazing to look back and see just how much progress we have made in a few months.

- [00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbTz-ScdFiw&t=554) This represents the next step on our journey towards the ultimate goal of infinite context.

- [00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbTz-ScdFiw&t=560) Okay, so far we have talked about two technical advances, multimodality and long context.

- [00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbTz-ScdFiw&t=567) Each is powerful on its own, but together they unlock deeper capabilities and more intelligence.

- [00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbTz-ScdFiw&t=574) Let's see how this comes to life with Google Workspace.

- [00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbTz-ScdFiw&t=578) People are always searching their emails in Gmail.

- [00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbTz-ScdFiw&t=581) We are working to make it much more powerful with Gemini.

- [00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbTz-ScdFiw&t=585) Let's look at how.

- [00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbTz-ScdFiw&t=587) As a parent, you want to know everything that's going on with your child's school.

- [00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbTz-ScdFiw&t=591) Okay, maybe not everything, but you want to stay informed.

- [00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbTz-ScdFiw&t=596) Gemini can help you keep up.

- [00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbTz-ScdFiw&t=598) Now we can ask Gemini to summarize all recent emails from the school.

- [00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbTz-ScdFiw&t=603) In the background, it's identifying relevant emails, even analyzing attachments like PDFs,
