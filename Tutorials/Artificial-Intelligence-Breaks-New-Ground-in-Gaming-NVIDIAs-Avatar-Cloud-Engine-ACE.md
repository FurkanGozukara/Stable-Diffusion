üî• Prepare to be mesmerized as we explore a completely AI-rendered scene, designed in the celebrated Unreal Engine 5. Observe the intricate lighting effects achieved through multiple sources and marvel at the realistic global illumination, which creates astoundingly beautiful shadows.

‚ú® In a groundbreaking collaboration, NVIDIA has partnered with Framework and avatar tool maker Comm AI. They've managed to orchestrate a spectacular demo featuring Jin, an AI character with a compelling backstory. The riveting narrative takes us through Jin's experiences as a ramen shop owner in a crime-ridden city, offering an unprecedented level of interaction and immersion.

‚ö° The highlight? Every conversation occurs in real-time without a pre-set script! The AI-infused characters respond realistically to your interactions, creating a truly immersive gaming experience. All facial animations, gestures, and domain knowledge are autonomously generated by the AI, ensuring that no two gaming experiences are identical.

üåê This video offers a tantalizing glimpse into the future of video games, where AI goes beyond rendering and synthesis of environments, playing a pivotal role in character animation. Step into a new world of gaming, where artificial intelligence is the architect of dynamic, immersive, and hyper-realistic experiences!

### Video Transcription


- [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMk5RHq8N1g&t=0) We used AI to render this scene. We're&nbsp; gonna also use AI to bring it alive.&nbsp;

- [00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMk5RHq8N1g&t=6) Today we're announcing NVIDIA ACE&nbsp; avatar cloud engine that is designed for&nbsp;

- [00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMk5RHq8N1g&t=14) animating to bringing a digital avatar&nbsp; to life. It has several characteristics,&nbsp;

- [00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMk5RHq8N1g&t=19) several capabilities, speech recognition,&nbsp; text-to-speech, natural language&nbsp;

- [00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMk5RHq8N1g&t=23) understanding, basically a large language&nbsp; model, and using the sound that you will&nbsp;

- [00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMk5RHq8N1g&t=29) be generating with your voice animate&nbsp; the face, and using the sound and the&nbsp;

- [00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMk5RHq8N1g&t=35) expression that you're saying animate&nbsp; your gestures. All of this is completely&nbsp;

- [00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMk5RHq8N1g&t=40) trained by AI. Let's take a look at this&nbsp; scene in just a second, but let me first&nbsp;

- [00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMk5RHq8N1g&t=45) tell you about it. It is completely&nbsp; rendered with ray tracing. Notice the&nbsp;

- [00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMk5RHq8N1g&t=50) beautiful lights, so many different&nbsp; lights, and all of the different lights&nbsp;

- [00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMk5RHq8N1g&t=54) are projecting light from that source, so&nbsp; you have all kinds of direct lights. You&nbsp;

- [00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMk5RHq8N1g&t=59) have global illumination. You're gonna&nbsp; see incredibly beautiful shadows and&nbsp;

- [00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMk5RHq8N1g&t=65) physics simulation, and notice the&nbsp; character, the beautiful rendering of the&nbsp;

- [00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMk5RHq8N1g&t=69) character. Everything is done in Unreal&nbsp; Engine 5. We partnered with framework and&nbsp;

- [00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMk5RHq8N1g&t=73) avatar tool maker called Comm AI,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMk5RHq8N1g&t=77) and together we developed this demo you're about to see. Okay, run please.&nbsp;

- [00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMk5RHq8N1g&t=101) Hey, Jin. How are you? Unfortunately, not&nbsp; so good. How come? I am worried about the&nbsp;

- [00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMk5RHq8N1g&t=107) crime around here. It's gotten bad&nbsp; lately. My ramen shop got caught in the&nbsp;

- [00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMk5RHq8N1g&t=112) crossfire. Can I help? If you want to do&nbsp; something about this, I have heard rumors&nbsp;

- [00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMk5RHq8N1g&t=118) that the powerful crime lord Kuman Aoki&nbsp; is causing all sorts of chaos in the&nbsp;

- [00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMk5RHq8N1g&t=122) city. He may be the root of this&nbsp; violence. I'll talk to him. Where can I&nbsp;

- [00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMk5RHq8N1g&t=127) find him? I have heard he hangs out&nbsp; in the underground fight clubs on the&nbsp;

- [00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMk5RHq8N1g&t=131) city's east side. Try there.&nbsp; Okay, I'll go. Be careful, Kai.&nbsp;

- [00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMk5RHq8N1g&t=141) None of that conversation was scripted.&nbsp; We gave that AI, this Jin AI character, a&nbsp;

- [00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMk5RHq8N1g&t=149) backstory. His story about his ramen&nbsp; shop and the story of this game.&nbsp;

- [00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMk5RHq8N1g&t=156) And all you have to do is go up and&nbsp; talk to this character, and because this&nbsp;

- [00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMk5RHq8N1g&t=160) character has been infused with&nbsp; artificial intelligence and large&nbsp;

- [00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMk5RHq8N1g&t=164) language models, it can interact with&nbsp; you, understand your meaning, and interact&nbsp;

- [00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMk5RHq8N1g&t=167) with you in a really reasonable way. All&nbsp; of the facial animation completely done&nbsp;

- [00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMk5RHq8N1g&t=171) by the AI. We have made it possible for&nbsp; all kinds of characters to be generated.&nbsp;

- [00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMk5RHq8N1g&t=176) They're all domain. They have their own&nbsp; domain knowledge. You can customize it so&nbsp;

- [00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMk5RHq8N1g&t=181) everybody's games different. And look&nbsp; how wonderfully beautiful they are and&nbsp;

- [00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMk5RHq8N1g&t=185) natural they are. This is the future of&nbsp; video games. Not only will AI contribute&nbsp;

- [00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMk5RHq8N1g&t=190) to the rendering and the synthesis of&nbsp; the environment, AI will also animate the&nbsp;

- [00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMk5RHq8N1g&t=195) characters. AI will be a very big&nbsp; part of the future of video games.
