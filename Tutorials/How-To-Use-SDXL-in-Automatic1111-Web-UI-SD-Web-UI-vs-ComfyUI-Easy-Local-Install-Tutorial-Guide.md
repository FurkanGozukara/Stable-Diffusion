### Video Transcription


- [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=0) Greetings everyone.

- [00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=1) In this video, I will show you how to install Automatic1111 web UI for Stable Diffusion

- [00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=6) X-Large model SDXL.

- [00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=8) I will compare the results of Automatic1111 web UI and ComfyUI for SDXL.

- [00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=15) I will show how you can use your SDXL trained LoRA models with Automatic1111 web UI.

- [00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=22) I will make a speed comparison test with Automatic1111 web UI and also Comfy UI.

- [00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=28) I will explain the logic of branches in GitHub repositories.

- [00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=32) Moreover, I will show the upcoming new features of SD web UI.

- [00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=37) So I have prepared a very detailed GitHub readme file for this tutorial.

- [00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=42) Every instruction and commands that you are going to need are written here.

- [00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=47) The links are provided here.

- [00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=48) I will update this file in future if it be necessary if something changes.

- [00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=54) So always look for this file and read it when you are watching this tutorial.

- [00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=58) I made an automatic installer script and posted it on Patreon.

- [00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=63) I also have prepared manual installation steps.

- [00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=67) So let's begin with automatic installation.

- [00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=69) Open this post, download the attached files, click them, move them into any folder where

- [00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=75) you want to install.

- [00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=77) So I did put the files here, double click this auto_1111_sdxl.bat file, click more info,

- [00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=84) run anyway, and you don't need to do anything else.

- [00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=87) It will install the latest version of Automatic1111 web UI that supports SDXL and it will also

- [00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=94) download the SDXL models for you.

- [00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=97) Let's also do our manual installation.

- [00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=100) First of all, you need to download SDXL base and refiner models.

- [00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=105) Open these two links.

- [00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=106) When you click the link, it will ask you researcher early access agreement like this.

- [00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=111) Go to very bottom, fill the fields as you wish.

- [00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=116) I am filling them with my.

- [00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=118) Check this checkbox and submit application.

- [00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=120) After that, you will be automatically approved.

- [00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=124) Then you need to download SDXL base 0.9 safetensors file.

- [00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=128) Click this download icon.

- [00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=129) The download will begin.

- [00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=131) Also, this is the refiner.

- [00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=133) Currently Automatic1111 web UI is not supporting refiner, but I am pretty sure it will come

- [00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=138) very soon.

- [00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=139) Also, don't download refiner model from here by clicking this download icon.

- [00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=144) Then we will clone the Automatic1111 web UI.

- [00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=148) This is its link and there is 1.5 version SDXL change log.

- [00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=154) There are some major improvements that is coming with 1.5 version of Automatic1111 web

- [00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=160) UI.

- [00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=161) It is starting to support SDXL and the best new feature is LoRA extension rework to include

- [00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=167) other types of networks.

- [00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=168) With this update, we will be able to use all of the LoRA types that we have trained or

- [00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=175) that we have downloaded from CivitAI or other places.

- [00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=179) Previously, we had to use SD web UI additional networks extension, but from now on we won't

- [00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=186) be have to use that extension.

- [00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=188) So let's begin with cloning it.

- [00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=190) Right click and copy link address.

- [00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=193) Make a new folder wherever you want to clone.

- [00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=195) So I will install my Automatic1111 into auto1111 install folder inside C drive.

- [00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=200) Click here, type CMD and it will start a new CMD window inside this folder.

- [00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=207) Type git clone and paste the copied link.

- [00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=210) It will clone it into this folder.

- [00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=213) By the way, you need to have installed Python and git.

- [00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=217) Here I have an amazing tutorial for that and here the download links for Python and git.

- [00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=222) Watch this tutorial if you don't know how to install Python.

- [00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=225) OK, cloning has been completed.

- [00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=227) There is one key issue.

- [00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=229) You see on the GitHub repository of Stable Diffusion web UI the last commit was last

- [00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=234) week.

- [00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=235) So where is this SDXL support?

- [00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=237) When you click here, you will see all of the branches of Stable Diffusion web UI GitHub

- [00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=243) repository.

- [00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=244) So what are these branches?

- [00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=245) Branches are used to do experimental development and first commit the new changes into these

- [00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=252) branches, verify them and then later merge them into master branch.

- [00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=257) So they are more like experimentation.

- [00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=259) So you see there were SDXL branch.

- [00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=261) Now it is merged into development branch.

- [00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=264) How do I know?

- [00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=265) When you click branches here you will see active branches and their latest updates.

- [00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=271) So this SDXL release candidate were merged into development branch.

- [00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=275) How do I know?

- [00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=276) When I click the dev branch it will show me that this branch is 282 commits ahead of master.

- [00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=283) Also, you see there is a message written here.

- [00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=287) Merge branch release candidate into development.

- [00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=289) So this is currently the most active, most up to date branch.

- [00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=293) Therefore, we are going to use this development branch to have SDXL support with SD web UI.

- [00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=300) And how are we going to do that?

- [00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=302) While your CMD folder is your Automatic1111 install, then you are ready.

- [00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=307) But currently we are not there yet.

- [00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=309) So enter inside your cloned folder.

- [00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=311) Open a new CMD like this.

- [00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=313) You see currently I am in Stable Diffusion web UI folder, then copy this command and

- [00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=318) paste it.

- [00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=319) And now we are switching to a new branch development.

- [00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=321) What if, if you want to return back to original branch, all you need to do is get checkout

- [00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=327) master and then you will be returned back to original master branch.

- [00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=332) But for SDXL currently only development branch is supporting SDXL.

- [00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=336) So we will use development branch.

- [00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=339) After this, you need to add these command line arguments.

- [00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=344) No-half-vae.

- [00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=345) And I am preferring xFormers because it is working great with SDXL.

- [00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=349) However, if you have a low VRAM, then you should try medvram and lowvram options, but

- [00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=355) try these only if you get out of VRAM memory error while using it.

- [00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=359) So where is these commands are written?

- [00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=361) Go to your installation folder, right click webui-user.bat file.

- [00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=365) If you're not seeing the file extension, go to views here and check file name extensions

- [00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=371) checkbox.

- [00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=372) So right click.

- [00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=373) I will edit with Notepad++ which is a free text editor.

- [00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=377) So you see this is where we are writing our commands and I will add the commands like

- [00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=382) this.

- [00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=383) After that, all I need to do is just double click and start it and it will install everything

- [00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=388) according to the development branch.

- [00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=390) Also, we need to move our downloaded models.

- [00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=393) I will cut them move back into my install folder.

- [00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=398) Inside models, inside Stable Diffusion.

- [00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=401) So this is where Stable Diffusion models are put.

- [00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=403) I will just cut and paste them here.

- [00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=406) So what if, if you have existing installation of Automatic1111 web UI, and you don't want

- [00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=412) to install a new one?

- [00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=414) So go to your existing installation, which I have here automatic web UI, start a new

- [00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=419) CMD.

- [00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=420) First, you need to update it.

- [00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=422) So copy this command "git pull" paste it.

- [00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=425) This will check the GitHub repository of Automatic1111 web UI and it will fetch all of the newest

- [00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=430) changes as you are seeing right now.

- [00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=433) Then we will do "git checkout dev" branch.

- [00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=436) And now I am in the development branch and I am ready to use my existing installation

- [00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=442) as well.

- [00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=443) Don't forget to copy paste your SDXL models into the models folder.

- [00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=447) So the rest is same with the new manual installation.

- [00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=450) Also, don't forget to put no-half-vae.

- [00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=453) You should not use no-half-vae with SD 1.5 versions if you are not getting VAE error.

- [00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=459) Because it will reduce your image generation speed.

- [00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=463) After installation has been completed, double click webui-user.bat file, and it will start

- [00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=468) your web UI instance.

- [00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=470) Once you started your instance, you will get your local running URL like this.

- [00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=475) And you see, it generates the SDXL base YAML file automatically this time, so we don't

- [00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=482) have to waste time with YAML files.

- [00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=484) So let's open our web UI.

- [00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=486) And now I can see SDXL based version is loaded like this.

- [00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=491) We can generate anything we wish.

- [00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=493) So I prepared a prompt to test out.

- [00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=496) Copy the prompt here.

- [00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=498) Let's paste it here.

- [00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=500) Copy the negative from here.

- [00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=501) Let's paste it here.

- [00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=503) SDXL base resolution is 1024 and 1024.

- [00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=507) If you want to obtain best quality images, then this is the resolution that you should

- [00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=512) use.

- [00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=513) Let's hit generate.

- [00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=514) And let's look at the speed while I am recording a video.

- [00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=518) It is pretty decent.

- [00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=519) When I'm not recording a video, it is up to 3.2 it per second.

- [00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=524) Okay, we got a picture.

- [00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=525) This is the first picture.

- [00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=527) Let's generate another one.

- [00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=529) And here another one.

- [00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=530) Okay, now we are getting a very good one.

- [00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=532) Okay, this one is amazing.

- [00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=534) Look at the details.

- [00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=535) And we are not even using the refiner of SDXL.

- [00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=539) Once it is implemented into Automatic1111 web UI, I think it will be amazing.

- [00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=545) Let's try with high resolution fix and also, let's use the same seed value.

- [00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=549) Okay, let's make the denoising strength as like 50%.

- [00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=552) And let's hit generate.

- [00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=554) When it will do high resolution fix steps, it will be much slower.

- [00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=558) Okay, high resolution steps are started, it is 1.7 seconds per it.

- [00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=563) It is upscaling 1024 into 2048.

- [00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=568) So from 1 megapixel to 4 megapixels.

- [00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=571) The speed is really really decent.

- [00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=572) And this is my webui-user.bat file I'm using.

- [00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=577) Okay, the image has been generated.

- [00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=579) Let's look at the details.

- [00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=581) Okay, you see this is 4 megapixels with high resolution fix.

- [00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=585) And the details are just amazing, amazing quality.

- [00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=589) And this is without refiner.

- [00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=590) When we have SDXL refiner, I think it will be the best ever generated images with Stable

- [00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=598) Diffusion so far.

- [00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=600) But even this image has so much details is looking amazing.

- [00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=605) Now let's compare it with the ComfyUI.

- [00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=609) If you don't know how to use ComfyUI, I have excellent tutorial here, just watch it, and

- [00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=613) you will learn how to install and use Comfy UI along with SDXL as well.

- [00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=618) Before starting my ComfyUI, I will update it.

- [00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=621) So let's run the update file.

- [00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=623) Maybe there are some changes.

- [00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=625) Okay.

- [00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=626) Then let's start with Nvidia GPU.

- [00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=629) By the way, I am currently using this much VRAM.

- [00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=631) So I will close Automatic1111 web UI instance.

- [00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=634) So I will load my Comfy UI workflow.

- [00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=638) It is here.

- [00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=639) Currently, it is also supporting the refiner.

- [00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=642) So let's see.

- [00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=644) These are positive prompts.

- [00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=645) These are negative prompts.

- [00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=647) Unfortunately, we can't compare with the same seed because the seeding algorithm of ComfyUI

- [00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=653) is different than Automatic1111 web UI.

- [00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=655) Therefore, even I have used this seed, it won't be the same.

- [00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=661) So let's queue the prompt and see the speed.

- [00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=663) Okay, the speed is much slower than Automatic1111 web UI.

- [00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=666) We were getting 2.7 it per second while I am recording video.

- [00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=671) With ComfyUI, we are only getting 1.45 it per second.

- [00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=675) Now the refiner will begin.

- [00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=677) You see it has loaded the refiner model.

- [00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=680) It is using this much VRAM at the moment.

- [00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=682) Okay, refiner steps are started.

- [00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=685) The refiner steps are slower than the base model generation.

- [00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=688) And we got the images.

- [00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=689) Okay, let's open images.

- [00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=692) So this is the base image.

- [00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=693) And here the refiner image.

- [00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=695) Okay, base image, refiner image, it is looking very, very different than Automatic1111 web

- [00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=701) UI.

- [00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=702) So let's make a comparison.

- [00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=703) But of course, these are not the same seeds.

- [00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=706) But the difference is huge.

- [00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=708) So the outputs are saved inside output, inside txt2img-images.

- [00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=712) Here, we will see the generated image.

- [00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=716) And here we see on the left Automatic1111 web UI base image.

- [00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=720) On the right ComfyUI base image.

- [00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=723) Unfortunately, since they are not same seed, I can't say which one is working better.

- [00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=729) And now we see on the left high resolution fix Automatic1111 web UI image and on the

- [00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=735) right refiner output of ComfyUI.

- [00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=737) I think high resolution fix is adding much more details than refiner itself.

- [00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=742) But if the refiner were available, it would be much better.

- [00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=747) But since they are not the same seed, as I said, we are not able to fully compare them.

- [00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=752) However, the speed of Automatic1111 web UI is much better than the Comfy UI at the moment.

- [00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=757) Okay, here another comparison on the left: Automatic1111 web UI on the right: Comfy UI.

- [00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=762) I don't know whether if any one of them is not working properly or not.

- [00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=767) But the style difference, the output difference is huge.

- [00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=770) So this is the results of the both UIs.

- [00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=774) So how you can use SDXL LoRAs with Automatic1111 web UI.

- [00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=778) Enter inside models, enter inside LoRA folder and put your trained LoRA files in here.

- [00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=785) Test9 is my own LoRA.

- [00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=787) If you don't know how to do SDXL and LoRA training, I have an amazing tutorial for that.

- [00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=792) The link is here.

- [00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=793) Watch this and you will be able to train your own LoRAs with the best known settings.

- [00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=798) So I had posted this yesterday and it went viral.

- [00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=801) Now I will show how did I generated these images as you are seeing right now.

- [00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=807) Let's load into PNG info and regenerate them.

- [00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=810) Okay, let's go to the PNG info.

- [00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=812) Here the generated output images.

- [00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=815) For example, let's pick which one.

- [00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=817) This one.

- [00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=818) Yes.

- [00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=819) PNG info, send text to image tab.

- [00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=821) Okay.

- [00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=822) These were all the settings.

- [00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=823) I didn't use any negative prompt.

- [00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=825) 1024 1024.

- [00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=826) This was the seed value.

- [00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=829) And this is my LoRA.

- [00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=830) How you are going to use LoRAs?

- [00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=832) Click this icon, go to LoRA, click refresh, and you will see all of the LoRAs that you

- [00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=839) have.

- [00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=840) And when you click one of the LoRA like this, it will get added.

- [00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=842) So let's hit generate and let's regenerate the same image.

- [00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=846) I am glad that now it supports all of the LoRA types and it is amazing.

- [00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=851) And here we are getting the image and here the generated image.

- [00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=855) It is amazing.

- [00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=856) With Automatic web UI, you have all of the amazing features when compared to ComfyUI.

- [00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=861) They are much harder to use in Comfy UI.

- [00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=864) You can use image the image, you can use inpaint, you can do high resolution fix.

- [00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=869) You can send to extras and do upscaling.

- [00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=872) All of the favorite features we have with Automatic1111 web UI now working with SDXL.

- [00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=877) However, ControlNet is still not available.

- [00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=880) I think it will become available very soon after the official 1.0 version release of

- [00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=886) SDXL.

- [00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=887) I hope you have enjoyed this video, please subscribe, support me by joining YouTube channel,

- [00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=900) Also in this particular tutorial, I have in more depth explained how to install and use

- [00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=905) Automatic1111 web UI.

- [00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=907) This is the SDXL LoRA training.

- [00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=910) And this is my famous most realistic training for faces.

- [00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=916) SDXL is also amazing.

- [00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=918) The quality of the clothing is much better than SD 1.5 version based models.

- [00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=924) If you also support me on Patreon, I would appreciate that very much.

- [00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=927) My YouTube revenue is very low.

- [00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=930) So with my Patreon supporters, I am able to continue producing higher quality videos and

- [00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_v5IR4dUQ&t=934) doing more research for you.
