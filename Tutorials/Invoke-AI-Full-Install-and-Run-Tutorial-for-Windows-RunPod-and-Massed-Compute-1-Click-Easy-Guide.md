- [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuxFBYAUGIY&t=0) Greetings everyone, today I will show you how&nbsp; to install Invoke AI on your Windows computer,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuxFBYAUGIY&t=6) on RunPod, and on Massed Compute. Additionally,&nbsp; I will show something new that I haven't shown&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuxFBYAUGIY&t=14) before ‚Äî how to use Massed Compute running&nbsp; applications on your PC like it is running&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuxFBYAUGIY&t=22) on your localhost. You see, this is a localhost&nbsp; URL, but it is running on the Massed Compute.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuxFBYAUGIY&t=28) It is amazing! Just keep watching. I will begin&nbsp; with showing on Windows, then Massed Compute, then&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuxFBYAUGIY&t=34) RunPod. You can check out the video description&nbsp; to find the accurate video chapters. So let's&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuxFBYAUGIY&t=40) begin with installing into Windows. Download the&nbsp; attachments from here; the link to this file will&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuxFBYAUGIY&t=45) be in the description of the video. Move the zip&nbsp; file wherever you want to install, extract the zip&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuxFBYAUGIY&t=51) file, enter inside the zip file, and double-click&nbsp; and start the Windows install.bat file. You&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuxFBYAUGIY&t=58) see is asking you to have Python 3.10 or Python&nbsp; 3.11, C++, CUDA, and also enable Windows long&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuxFBYAUGIY&t=67) paths. So let's enable the Windows long paths&nbsp; from here. Double-click it; it will ask you for&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuxFBYAUGIY&t=73) permission, then click yes here, and it will be&nbsp; done. Then click Windows install.bat file&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuxFBYAUGIY&t=79) again. Press any key. So for the requirements,&nbsp; I already have an excellent tutorial here; the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuxFBYAUGIY&t=84) link is here. Watch it, learn it. Also, for CUDA&nbsp; 12.4 and C++ tools, I have a new post, so you can&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuxFBYAUGIY&t=93) also check it out if you encounter any issues. So&nbsp; after the installer initializes, it will ask you&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuxFBYAUGIY&t=98) some options. Just hit enter here, hit again if it&nbsp; fails, hit multiple times, yes, now working. Okay,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuxFBYAUGIY&t=106) it is asking you to select the installation&nbsp; folder. I want to install it wherever I started&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuxFBYAUGIY&t=111) the bat file, so I deleted the folder path&nbsp; and hit enter here. It will ask you like this,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuxFBYAUGIY&t=117) hit yes, and hit enter. Then it will ask for your&nbsp; GPU. I have CUDA, so 1, and hit enter, and it&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuxFBYAUGIY&t=124) will start the installation automatically for you.&nbsp; Just wait patiently. Okay, so the installation has&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuxFBYAUGIY&t=130) been completed. It says "Installation successful,&nbsp; press any key." Then when you return back to your&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuxFBYAUGIY&t=136) folder, you will see Invoke.bat file. This is&nbsp; the file that will start Invoke AI. Double-click&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuxFBYAUGIY&t=142) it, select option 1, and that's it. It will start&nbsp; Invoke AI on your local Windows computer. It is&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuxFBYAUGIY&t=149) downloading some of the necessary files, and it&nbsp; is getting started. Okay, it has started. You see,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuxFBYAUGIY&t=156) this is the URL Uvicorn, running on this URL. To&nbsp; open this URL, I am going to click here, copy,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuxFBYAUGIY&t=165) go to your browser, and paste, and Invoke AI has&nbsp; started. You can set your models from the models&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuxFBYAUGIY&t=171) folder, scan the folder, enter wherever the&nbsp; checkpoints you have. You can download models from&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuxFBYAUGIY&t=177) starter models from here quickly, and then you can&nbsp; generate images from here. You need to select your&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuxFBYAUGIY&t=182) model. Let's generate an image as an example, then&nbsp; we will be moving. So I will scan this folder,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuxFBYAUGIY&t=189) and I will use Juggernaut XL version 9. I&nbsp; will click; this is my existing model, but you&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuxFBYAUGIY&t=194) can download models quickly from here ‚Äî just click&nbsp; the plus icon, and it will download them. Okay,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuxFBYAUGIY&t=199) then I go to the canvas. I have a prompt like "a&nbsp; car." The model is selected. Invoke. Now it will&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuxFBYAUGIY&t=206) start generating a model for me. You can see&nbsp; the progress on the CMD window. Okay, this is&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuxFBYAUGIY&t=211) the speed. It is not a great speed, if you ask my&nbsp; opinion, on RTX 3090, and the image is generated.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuxFBYAUGIY&t=218) Okay, now I will move to Massed Compute.&nbsp; Please use this link to register. Open it. After&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuxFBYAUGIY&t=223) registering and setting up your billing. Then go&nbsp; to deploy. Here, select GPU. I suggest you use RTX&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuxFBYAUGIY&t=232) A6000 GPU. If this is not available, use RTX A6000&nbsp; alt config. In some cases, it may not have enough&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuxFBYAUGIY&t=241) RAM memory. Then you can select 2. If you also&nbsp; need more space, you can increase the number of&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuxFBYAUGIY&t=246) GPUs to have more disk space. Then select category&nbsp; creator, select SECourses. You see the current&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuxFBYAUGIY&t=253) price is $1.25 because it is 2 GPUs. Select 1.&nbsp; Now the price is 62 cents. After we apply our&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuxFBYAUGIY&t=261) coupon SECourses, verify it will become 31 cents&nbsp; for this amazing GPU and the machine. Then click&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuxFBYAUGIY&t=268) deploy. Our coupon is permanent, and our image is&nbsp; amazing. You will see it! So it is starting. Wait&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuxFBYAUGIY&t=275) until the initialization has been completed.&nbsp; So I am going to use ThinLinc Drive. You can&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuxFBYAUGIY&t=280) download it from here. It is so straightforward&nbsp; to install and use. Just set it up from here;&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuxFBYAUGIY&t=287) then open your ThinLinc client from here. Go to&nbsp; options, go to local devices, drives, and set&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuxFBYAUGIY&t=293) your synchronization folder. Set it as read and&nbsp; write. In the other tutorials, I explained this&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuxFBYAUGIY&t=299) in detail. Okay, so the machine has started. Let's&nbsp; connect as usual, and from here, copy your IP and&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuxFBYAUGIY&t=307) password, and connect. Continue. Let's download&nbsp; the file again, move it into your Mass Compute&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuxFBYAUGIY&t=314) synchronization folder like this. Click start.&nbsp; Massed Compute deal is just amazing ‚Äî amazing&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuxFBYAUGIY&t=320) price, amazing powerful GPU, and amazing speed&nbsp; their machines have. You will see it. Go to the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuxFBYAUGIY&t=327) home, go to the thin drives, Mass Compute. This&nbsp; is my synchronization folder. Then find your zip&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuxFBYAUGIY&t=333) file and drag and drop it into your downloads&nbsp; folder here. Wait until it's copied. Yes,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuxFBYAUGIY&t=339) it is copied. Right-click and extract here, then&nbsp; enter inside this folder. You will see that it&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuxFBYAUGIY&t=346) has a Massed Compute instructions file. You really&nbsp; should read my instructions file. For installation

- [00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuxFBYAUGIY&t=353) we are going to copy this command, open a terminal&nbsp; here, paste it, and hit enter. The installation&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuxFBYAUGIY&t=359) is the same as on Windows, actually. Just hit&nbsp; enter on this question, then delete this part, so&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuxFBYAUGIY&t=366) it will be installed wherever you have copied and&nbsp; pasted your files. Hit enter, then hit yes, and&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuxFBYAUGIY&t=372) hit enter. If you get this message, just cancel&nbsp; it. Okay, I am going to use NVIDIA GPU, select 1,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuxFBYAUGIY&t=378) and hit enter, and it will start the installation.&nbsp; Installation on Massed Compute is just super fast.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuxFBYAUGIY&t=385) Their machines are just super fast. Okay, so&nbsp; the installation has been completed. You see,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuxFBYAUGIY&t=390) "Installation successful." Now we are going to&nbsp; start the Invoke AI. For starting it, copy this&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuxFBYAUGIY&t=396) line, copy it, go to the installation folder,&nbsp; open a new terminal, paste it like this, hit 1,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuxFBYAUGIY&t=403) and hit enter. Then you will see that it will&nbsp; start here. Okay, you see Uvicorn running on ‚Äî let&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuxFBYAUGIY&t=412) me zoom in to show you. Okay, here, so open this&nbsp; link, and you can use it inside the ThinLinc&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuxFBYAUGIY&t=419) client. However, it is not very fast, so if you&nbsp; want to use it on your computer in a secure way,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuxFBYAUGIY&t=425) we are going to follow the commands here. First&nbsp; of all, go back to your Massed Compute running&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuxFBYAUGIY&t=430) instance, copy the IP from here, you see,&nbsp; copy it, go back to your ThinLinc client,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuxFBYAUGIY&t=436) and change the IP address here to your IP address&nbsp; of your machine. Then copy it, open a PowerShell&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuxFBYAUGIY&t=444) in your Windows computer like this, paste it,&nbsp; and hit enter. It may ask you some questions,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuxFBYAUGIY&t=450) just type "yes, yes, yes." Then it will ask you&nbsp; for the password, so for the password, copy the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuxFBYAUGIY&t=456) password from here. It is copied. Then return back&nbsp; to PowerShell, right-click, then hit enter. So it&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuxFBYAUGIY&t=462) will approve your connection. Okay, after that,&nbsp; to connect it, we are going to use this local URL.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuxFBYAUGIY&t=471) Since this SSH is running, then this local URL&nbsp; will be bound to the Massed Compute. So actually,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuxFBYAUGIY&t=479) this application is not running on my computer&nbsp; right now, but it is running on Massed Compute&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuxFBYAUGIY&t=485) right now. As usual, you can download the models&nbsp; from starter downloads, or you can scan the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuxFBYAUGIY&t=491) folders of the Massed Compute. So for the Massed&nbsp; Compute folder, it is here. Just copy-paste it and&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuxFBYAUGIY&t=497) scan the folder. You see, it is running because&nbsp; it is running on the Massed Compute, not on my&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuxFBYAUGIY&t=502) computer. Now I can add the models from here, or I&nbsp; can download any model I want from here. Actually,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuxFBYAUGIY&t=509) I'm going to show FluxDev download on RunPod. It&nbsp; is the same; there is no difference. Then go to&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuxFBYAUGIY&t=514) the canvas and wait for the models to appear. I&nbsp; think it is still adding. Yes, added, yes. Now I&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuxFBYAUGIY&t=521) should be able to select. Yes, select it, then&nbsp; just hit Invoke. You see it shows the queue, and&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuxFBYAUGIY&t=526) you can see the images are getting generated. I&nbsp; can see that on my Massed Compute. Yes, it is 5 it&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuxFBYAUGIY&t=534) per second, which is really, really good. You can&nbsp; see it here. So it is working amazing as expected.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuxFBYAUGIY&t=541) Now, as a next step, I will use RunPod. Okay, so&nbsp; for RunPod, use this link to register, please.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuxFBYAUGIY&t=548) Then let's log in, set up your billing, and set&nbsp; some money. Then deploy. You can use Secure Cloud,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuxFBYAUGIY&t=554) Community Cloud. I am going to use Secure Cloud&nbsp; for faster setup, and I am going to use US Texas&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuxFBYAUGIY&t=561) 3, this is the fastest one. Then let's pick the&nbsp; 4090. Use this template; I didn't test the other&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuxFBYAUGIY&t=569) ones. So, to select that template, type Torch and&nbsp; RunPod Torch 2.1. I am not sure if others will&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuxFBYAUGIY&t=577) work or not. Set your volume disk as you wish.&nbsp; Let's set it to 100 gigabytes, and you can use the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuxFBYAUGIY&t=583) proxy of RunPod to connect, so don't forget that&nbsp; 9091. Then set overrides, and we are ready. Deploy&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuxFBYAUGIY&t=591) on demand. Then go to "My Pods." I already have&nbsp; a lot of tutorials for RunPod. You can watch them&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuxFBYAUGIY&t=597) to learn how to use RunPod better. You can always&nbsp; message me, and I will link you to the accurate&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuxFBYAUGIY&t=604) tutorials. Just wait until the connect button&nbsp; appears. So the connect button appeared. Let's&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuxFBYAUGIY&t=609) connect. Connect from the Jupyter Lab interface.&nbsp; Let's download the model again. You see it is&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuxFBYAUGIY&t=615) downloaded. Wait for Jupyter Lab to open. Okay,&nbsp; it's opened. So I am going to upload the file,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuxFBYAUGIY&t=622) select the downloaded Invoke AI zip file like&nbsp; this, wait until the upload is completed. Yes,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuxFBYAUGIY&t=627) then right-click and extract the archive, so it&nbsp; will extract everything into here. Refresh, then&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuxFBYAUGIY&t=633) open the RunPod instructions txt file. Copy this,&nbsp; open a new terminal, paste, and hit enter. Then&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuxFBYAUGIY&t=641) it will ask us the options; just wait. Okay, same&nbsp; as usual, just hit enter. I will delete this, so I&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuxFBYAUGIY&t=648) want to install it into the workspace. Hit enter,&nbsp; then type "yes," and hit enter, and then just&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuxFBYAUGIY&t=655) wait. Okay, then type the GPU "NVIDIA," hit 1, and&nbsp; hit enter, and the installation has started. Okay,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuxFBYAUGIY&t=663) so the installation has been completed on RunPod.&nbsp; Let's return back to the RunPod instructions.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuxFBYAUGIY&t=668) Copied this and open the terminal. I make my&nbsp; installers all the same way, so once you learn one&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuxFBYAUGIY&t=674) of them, it works for all. Hit 1, and hit enter.&nbsp; Wait until you see the local started URL. As&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuxFBYAUGIY&t=682) usual, it shows our GPU cuDNN version, and yes,&nbsp; you see the local URL started. Then to connect,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuxFBYAUGIY&t=690) connect and connect HTTP service port 9091, and it&nbsp; is started. Now I can use it. Currently, I don't&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuxFBYAUGIY&t=700) have any models, so I am going to download a model&nbsp; from starter models. Let's download FluxDev. Since&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuxFBYAUGIY&t=706) this is a very powerful GPU, we can use it. So it&nbsp; is going to download its full size. You can also&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuxFBYAUGIY&t=711) download quantized ones. You see the download&nbsp; is in progress. It is really, really fast. This&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuxFBYAUGIY&t=717) machine is fast. Yes, it is downloading right&nbsp; now, so wait until all downloads are completed,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuxFBYAUGIY&t=723) and progress is completed. It is hashing after&nbsp; downloading them, so it is taking some time. We&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuxFBYAUGIY&t=730) can see that here on the CMD window, but it should&nbsp; be fast. So it is all completed. Let's generate an&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuxFBYAUGIY&t=738) image. So I click here, then I go to the canvas.&nbsp; Now the FluxDev is here. Let's type a prompt:&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuxFBYAUGIY&t=744) "amazing sports car, race car on the roads." Okay,&nbsp; something like this; it's not very important. Then&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuxFBYAUGIY&t=752) we can see the speed of generation here. It&nbsp; is first loading the checkpoint shards. Yes,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuxFBYAUGIY&t=758) pretty fast. It is fully utilizing the VRAM.&nbsp; You see, it is almost using it entirely,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuxFBYAUGIY&t=764) and the generation speed is 1.6 it per second.&nbsp; It is slower than Swarm UI. With Swarm UI,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuxFBYAUGIY&t=771) you can use --fast and generate images faster, but&nbsp; yes, it is here. So this is how you can install&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuxFBYAUGIY&t=778) and run Invoke AI on RunPod. I hope you have&nbsp; enjoyed it. I am not an expert on Invoke AI,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuxFBYAUGIY&t=785) but this is how you install them and start using&nbsp; them. Hopefully, see you in future tutorials.
