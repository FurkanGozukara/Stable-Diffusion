### Video Transcription


- [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=0) Greetings everyone, the most powerful and most&nbsp; advanced open-source public locally available

- [00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=7) to use video generation model Wan AI from Alibaba&nbsp; Group has been published. So in this tutorial you

- [00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=14) are going to learn everything about this model&nbsp; and how to run it on your Windows computer. If

- [00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=21) you want to run it on a cloud machine locally on&nbsp; RunPod on Massed Compute, this is the tutorial

- [00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=27) that you have been waiting for. Wan AI is so&nbsp; powerful that it is able to compete against

- [00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=34) the paid services such as Kling, Runway ML, or&nbsp; the other ones that you can imagine of. You can

- [00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=41) run this model totally locally for free forever&nbsp; on your computer. And, imagine you are getting

- [00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=48) the quality of the paid services such as Kling.&nbsp; It is even able to compete with the Open AI Sora

- [00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=55) model. It is so good and so high quality. And,&nbsp; you can use this model on your computer. The model

- [00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=61) weights are totally publicly published. In today's&nbsp; tutorial, I will show you how to 1-click install

- [00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=68) and use it in a very advanced Gradio application&nbsp; that I have developed. The model is just amazing,

- [00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=74) currently supports text to video, image to video,&nbsp; video to video. And we have been waiting for image

- [00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=81) to video for a long time for public models with&nbsp; such quality and power and it is here. Not only

- [00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=87) image to video, this model extra supports video&nbsp; to video as well. And they have published it,

- [00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=93) open-source, it is truly SOTA, state-of-the-art.&nbsp; And today, we are going to learn everything about

- [00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=100) this model. They have published 14 billion&nbsp; parameter and 1.3 billion parameter model.

- [00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=106) And the Gradio application that I have developed&nbsp; is able to run this model as low as 3.5 GB VRAM

- [00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=115) GPU. Therefore, even if you have a low VRAM GPU,&nbsp; you will be able to use this amazing model really

- [00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=121) fast. The Gradio application I have developed is&nbsp; so easy to install and use, but it has all the

- [00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=127) features that you need. And I have generated non&nbsp; cherry-picked videos for you to show you. Okay,

- [00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=133) let's look at the some of the more generations I&nbsp; have made, there is nothing cherry-picked, they

- [00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=138) are the first trials I have made. The prompt is&nbsp; here, the uploaded image is here and let's look at

- [00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=146) the fidelity. This is 14 billion parameters image&nbsp; to video model, you see this is the fidelity of

- [00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=153) the image. This is just perfect, no deformation,&nbsp; nothing. It is perfect. And here, another example

- [00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=159) I have made, this is made with the 14 billion&nbsp; parameters text to video model. This is the

- [00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=165) prompt, I made the Claude AI to write prompts, it&nbsp; is for free, I will show in the tutorial, and you

- [00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=172) see this is the generation. This is next level,&nbsp; this is at the level of the paid services, that

- [00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=178) you pay a lot of money and you wait a lot of time.&nbsp; And here, another image to video, so this is the

- [00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=185) prompt, this is the generation as you are seeing&nbsp; it is just mind-blowingly good, it is amazing, and

- [00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=191) you can see the input image is here, the fidelity&nbsp; of the model is just amazing. And here, another

- [00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=196) image to video, you see, this is just amazingly&nbsp; animated, you can see the input image is here.

- [00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=202) This is a text to prompt, this didn't work very&nbsp; well, I think, but it is how it is as you are

- [00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=208) seeing right now. And I also generated an anime&nbsp; video like this from the 14 billion text to video

- [00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=215) and the quality is just mind-blowingly good. This&nbsp; is literally a professional level anime. You are

- [00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=223) seeing the quality, the animation, the smoothness,&nbsp; it is just perfect level. In one generation,

- [00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=229) I have forgotten to write prompt. I've written&nbsp; it into negative prompt and this is the result

- [00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=235) as you are seeing. So, do not forget to write your&nbsp; prompt, but you can also provide negative prompt,

- [00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=240) of course. I didn't provide in the other&nbsp; examples. If you don't write the prompt,

- [00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=244) it will generate something like this. So,&nbsp; the rest of the tutorial will be like this,

- [00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=248) I will show you how to install and how to use the&nbsp; application on Windows in details. So, watch the

- [00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=255) Windows tutorial part to learn the details of the&nbsp; application. I will make comparison with the RTX

- [00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=261) 5090 and RTX 3090 TI for all the models on this&nbsp; computer as you are seeing. So, I really recommend

- [00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=269) to watch the entire tutorial to see the speed on&nbsp; the newest generation GPU, and also a very decent,

- [00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=276) powerful GPU, RTX 3090 TI. RTX 5090 is performing&nbsp; amazing. I have made it available to install for

- [00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=283) RTX 5000 series as well, whether it is RTX 5070,&nbsp; 5080, it will work on all of them. It is working

- [00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=291) with Python virtual environment, so it will not&nbsp; affect, impact any other of your AI applications.

- [00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=297) After the Windows tutorial part, I will move on&nbsp; to the cloud services. So, if you don't have a

- [00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=302) powerful GPU, you will be able to install it on&nbsp; Massed Compute, this is my recommendation with

- [00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=308) L40 GPU or a better GPU and you will be able to&nbsp; generate whatever video you want with extremely

- [00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=315) cheap prices. Then, after the Massed Compute, I&nbsp; will show how to generate and use on RunPod. So, I

- [00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=322) will cover everything that you need for this and I&nbsp; am updating this application. Just make a reply to

- [00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=328) the post or the video and hopefully, I will try to&nbsp; implement the feature that you need. So, as usual,

- [00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=334) I have prepared a very detailed post, where you&nbsp; will find all of the necessary instructions to

- [00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=340) install Wan 2.1 application on your Windows or&nbsp; on Massed Compute or RunPod. I really recommend

- [00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=348) to read this post extremely carefully from top to&nbsp; bottom. You will find the installer zip file at

- [00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=355) the top of the post or at the bottom of the post,&nbsp; where you will find as an attachment like this.

- [00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=360) So, let's download from the attachments. For this&nbsp; application to work on Windows, you need to have

- [00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=366) installed requirements, to install requirements, I&nbsp; already have a requirements tutorial, for RTX 5000

- [00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=373) series, I also recommend to install CUDA 12.8.&nbsp; You will learn how to install it once you follow

- [00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=380) this tutorial video and its resource file. This&nbsp; is totally public video, so I really recommend

- [00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=386) to watch it before starting installation. Move&nbsp; the installed file into one of your hard drives.

- [00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=392) Do not use shared drives like OneDrive, Google&nbsp; Drive, or anything. Extract the archive. After

- [00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=400) extracting the archive, you will see the files&nbsp; like this, the installer files. First of all,

- [00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=406) you need to run installer. Do not forget that. So,&nbsp; there is Windows install.bat file, double click

- [00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=412) it. It will ask you this, click More info run&nbsp; anyway. Do not run it as administrator because it

- [00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=419) will break your installation. The installation is&nbsp; totally automatic, you don't need to do anything,

- [00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=425) this will install everything for you. If you&nbsp; have 5000 series GPUs like RTX 5090, 5080,

- [00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=432) 5070, we have RTX 5000 series installation. This&nbsp; installation is also working with older GPUs, so

- [00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=439) I am going to install that way because I can also&nbsp; use my RTX 3090 TI with that. So, double click it,

- [00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=446) what is the difference of this one? This is using&nbsp; the latest nightly version Pytorch and also Torch

- [00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=454) vision, and also precompiled Flash Attention for&nbsp; this version. This is working on RTX 5000 series

- [00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=461) perfectly fine. Just wait for installation&nbsp; to be completed. If you encounter any errors,

- [00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=467) you can select all of the installation logs, copy,&nbsp; paste into a text file and you can email me that

- [00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=475) error logs, if anything happens, but it shouldn't&nbsp; happen if you follow the requirements tutorial.

- [00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=479) Once you see that, this folder is generated,&nbsp; during the installation you can begin downloading

- [00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=485) the model files. So for downloading model files,&nbsp; we have Windows download models files.bat file,

- [00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=491) double click it. More info run anyway. It will&nbsp; ask you options to download the video models. So,

- [00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=498) the very fast working model is the Wan 2.1 text&nbsp; to video 1.3 billion parameters models. This is

- [00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=506) extremely lightweight, it is working as low as 3.5&nbsp; GB of VRAM having GPUs. Its resolution is 640 to

- [00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=516) 640, the best working resolutions are 480 to 832&nbsp; or 832 to 480. This model is also supporting video

- [00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=526) to video, this is the only model that supports&nbsp; video to video. Unfortunately, this model is not

- [00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=530) supporting image to video. The second model is&nbsp; Wan 2.1 720 pixels image to video model, this is

- [00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=538) the most VRAM, most GPU power demanding model, but&nbsp; it is also the most powerful image to video model

- [00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=546) available to use right now as an open-source, as&nbsp; a model that you can use locally. There is also

- [00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=552) alternative 480 pixel image to video model. This&nbsp; is at least 3 times faster than the 720p model to

- [00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=561) generate because it is lower resolution, you can&nbsp; also use this, and the fourth option is the 720

- [00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=567) pixel resolution text to video model. This model&nbsp; is the most capable model to generate videos from

- [00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=574) text prompts, this is way better than the 1.3&nbsp; billion parameter model. So, you can download

- [00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=579) them one by one by entering their number, or you&nbsp; can download all of them with option five. So,

- [00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=585) I will use option five. The models are huge,&nbsp; however, I have optimized the downloader, so it

- [00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=591) will download with the maximum possible speed. You&nbsp; can see that I am getting 50 megabytes per second,

- [00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=597) I am going to get over 100 megabytes per second on&nbsp; my local computer. On cloud machines, I am able to

- [00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=603) get over 1000 megabytes per second, you will&nbsp; see in the next chapter of the video when I

- [00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=609) install on Massed Compute and also on RunPod. So,&nbsp; sometimes, some people reporting that their model

- [00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=616) downloading fails, how you can fix the problem&nbsp; is, open this Windows download models .bat file,

- [00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=622) you can open it with any text editor, I will open&nbsp; in Notepad, then, you need to remove this line.

- [00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=630) You see? This is for speeding up the download, but&nbsp; if you are getting error, you need to delete this,

- [00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=637) save and run the downloader again. I am still&nbsp; trying to figure out how this error occurs,

- [00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=644) I reported this issue to the developers, but&nbsp; meanwhile, this is the solution that you can make.

- [00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=649) Then follow the installation and model downloads.&nbsp; The installation already have been completed. So

- [00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=655) I am going to move my already downloaded models to&nbsp; here to start using it, but you can see that it is

- [00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=661) downloading the necessary models extremely fast as&nbsp; you can see right now. So let's just close this,

- [00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=667) let's go back to my previous installation which&nbsp; is inside here, models. So, I will cut this and

- [00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=674) I will go back to my new installed folder and I&nbsp; will delete the models like this and I will paste

- [00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=682) the model and yes, I am ready. So after the models&nbsp; have been downloaded, the installation has been

- [00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=688) completed, how I am going to start? You see there&nbsp; is start APP .bat file, double click it, more

- [00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=694) info run anyway. Remember, do not run anything as&nbsp; administrator. Moreover, all of my AI applications

- [00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=701) generates a virtual environment. Therefore they&nbsp; are all isolated and they will never break any

- [00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=707) of your existing applications. So, this is our&nbsp; interface, it is extremely advanced and simple

- [00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=713) to use. We have the model selections from here. As&nbsp; you change them, you will see that the parameters

- [00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=719) are changing, the GPU presets are changing. What&nbsp; are the GPU presets are doing? It is deciding that

- [00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=726) how much of the model will be kept in the GPU&nbsp; memory rather than your system memory. You can

- [00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=732) see that the numbers are changing. If you get out&nbsp; of VRAM error, you can reduce this number and try

- [00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=738) again. It will use lesser VRAM if you do that.&nbsp; So let's begin generation, we also have prompt

- [00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=744) enhance option. So, you can type a simple prompt&nbsp; like a cat walking on a grass field and you can

- [00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=753) use this prompt enhance. When you first time use&nbsp; it, it will download the necessary models. What

- [00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=759) it is going to do that it is going to use a local&nbsp; LLM and it is going to enhance your prompt. This

- [00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=767) is from the official repository implementation.&nbsp; And you see that it improved our prompt to a cat

- [00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=774) strolls gracefully through a sunlight grass field,&nbsp; its tail swaying gently behind, close up, slow

- [00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=780) motion shot. However, you can further improve&nbsp; this prompt if you want. You can use LLMs like

- [00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=787) Chat GPT or Claude to improve it further. I&nbsp; will show the improvement for image to video

- [00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=794) and video to video in the following chapter. So,&nbsp; let's generate a video with RTX 5090 and see the

- [00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=800) speed. It will fit into VRAM entirely. We can see&nbsp; the how much VRAM it is being using. So, nvitop

- [00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=810) and we can see that how much VRAM it will use&nbsp; like this. And also I am recording a video right

- [00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=817) now. Therefore, I am using a lot of GPU power.&nbsp; I also made some slight over-clocking like 300

- [00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=824) plus megahertz for core and 1500 megahertz for&nbsp; memory and we can see the speed, yes. It is 4.25

- [00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=834) second IT. If you want faster results, you can&nbsp; reduce the number of inference steps here, but

- [00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=840) 50 steps is working really best. I really don't&nbsp; recommend unless you have to. It is also pretty

- [00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=846) fast. You see it is already 11 steps, 12 steps, so&nbsp; it will take around three to four minutes on this

- [00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=852) GPU. But, what about other GPUs? Let's also start&nbsp; another instance with the RTX 3090 TI that I have.

- [00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=859) To start it, I will copy paste the start APP .bat&nbsp; file, edit its content and I am going to limit it

- [00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=866) to CUDA visible devices one. So this application&nbsp; will only see my second GPU. Then double click it,

- [00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=873) and now, this is running on my second GPU. So&nbsp; let's copy this prompt and hit here and we are

- [00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=880) ready to generate. You can also change the&nbsp; seed. You see it is random seed by default.

- [00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=886) You can change the video saving FPS and number&nbsp; of frames, but 81 frames is the best. You can

- [00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=893) also reduce this or increase it, it works. And&nbsp; the quality of the video is five by default.

- [00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=899) So let's make the aspect ratio different for this&nbsp; one. I will make it 9 to 16 and generate. Now we

- [00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=908) will see the speed of the RTX 3090 TI as well. You&nbsp; see the 3090 TI were not using any VRAM. Therefore

- [00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=915) we will see the exact VRAM usage and it is using 6&nbsp; GB of VRAM memory. However, if you have lower GPU,

- [00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=923) you can select the option 4 GB and it will make&nbsp; the number of persistent parameters to zero. In

- [00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=930) that case, it will use only 3.5 GB of VRAM memory.&nbsp; I have tested all of the configurations and you

- [00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=939) see 5090 almost completed. The 3090 TI is getting&nbsp; like 8.6 second IT and 5090 is like 4.18 seconds

- [00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=949) IT. However, since I am recording video, it is&nbsp; slower. I will show you the actual speed with

- [00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=955) stopping video and testing for you. Okay, so&nbsp; I have turned off recording and regenerated a

- [00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=962) video on RTX 5090 to test its real speed and it is&nbsp; amazing. It took only two minutes, 59 seconds for

- [00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=971) 50 steps for the 1.3 billion parameters, 480 pixel&nbsp; resolution model. And RTX 3090 TI took 7 minute,

- [00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=981) 11 seconds for 50 steps for the same. So, here&nbsp; I am recording the durations and the tasks and

- [00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=988) you can see the difference. You will notice&nbsp; that the VAE decoding took a lot of time, nine

- [00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=993) seconds. And on powerful GPUs, you can disable&nbsp; tiled VAE decode for the 1.3 billion parameter

- [00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=1002) models and it will be almost instant. Currently&nbsp; FP8 version is not working. I have reported this

- [00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=1011) issue to the developers of the library for speed&nbsp; up optimization that we use and hopefully once

- [00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=1017) it is implemented, it will start working and it&nbsp; will be even faster and lower VRAM, hopefully. So,

- [00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=1024) what else you can make? Our application saves&nbsp; every prompt generated. When you open the outputs

- [00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=1030) folder from here, you will see that there&nbsp; is outputs folder and inside outputs folder,

- [00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=1035) you will see that every generated video is saved&nbsp; with the prompt used. We also support multi-line

- [00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=1043) prompt generation. So, you can type multiple&nbsp; prompts like a dog strolls gracefully, and let's

- [00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=1050) say a lion. And when you enable these multi-line&nbsp; prompts, it will generate all three videos and

- [00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=1058) save them in the outputs folder for you. Moreover,&nbsp; you can generate multiple videos as well. How? You

- [00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=1066) see there is number of generations, set this to&nbsp; 10 and it will generate 10 videos for each prompt

- [00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=1072) with a random seed each time. So, you can generate&nbsp; multiple videos and pick the very best one that

- [00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=1078) you like. Okay, let's see the generated videos,&nbsp; it is like this. The prompt is not very detailed.

- [00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=1083) Therefore, the video is not that great, but still&nbsp; it is a very decent quality and really fast. So,

- [00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=1090) how to use video to video? The video to video&nbsp; only works with this model. Therefore, select

- [00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=1095) it and for activating video to video, you need to&nbsp; upload an input video here. So, let's use one of

- [00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=1101) the generated videos, for example, this one. You&nbsp; see the video is here. The resolution of the video

- [00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=1107) is this one, so I will set it and I need to type a&nbsp; prompt. I will try something really, really hard,

- [00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=1113) a cat made of papers. And, you need to change&nbsp; the denoising. Let's apply a strong denoising

- [00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=1120) like 95 percentage. Then let's generate and see.&nbsp; All right, the video has been generated. However,

- [00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=1128) since I did set number of images to generate 10,&nbsp; it is continuing to generate, but we can see the

- [00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=1135) generation in the outputs folder. So, when I open&nbsp; the outputs folder, this is the output and yes,

- [00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=1142) this is really, really amazing. I mean, I told it&nbsp; to convert this video into a walking cat made of

- [00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=1151) papers and we can see that it did it. However,&nbsp; since we applied a huge amount of denoising,

- [00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=1159) it is a little bit changed as expected, I mean,&nbsp; the angle, the rotation, but it worked. So,

- [00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=1166) this is how you can use video to video, you need&nbsp; to experiment and find out what is working best

- [00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=1172) for you. So I am restarting my application. Okay,&nbsp; what about other models like 14 billion parameters

- [00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=1181) text to video model? The 14 billion parameters&nbsp; text to video model is way more powerful than

- [00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=1188) 1.3 billion parameter model. However, it is also&nbsp; extremely VRAM demanding. We are only able to

- [00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=1194) keep low number of parameters in the VRAM. So&nbsp; I am changing my presets to 32 GB for the RTX

- [00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=1201) 5090. However, how much VRAM I am using right&nbsp; now? I am using around 3 GB, so it may not be

- [00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=1208) sufficient. So, let's make this 5.5 instead of 6.5&nbsp; and we can select any resolution from here. So,

- [00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=1216) the native resolution is 1280 to 720 pixels. So,&nbsp; let's generate a video on RTX 5090 and let's try

- [00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=1225) to generate one on RTX 3090 TI as well. These&nbsp; values are extremely delicately researched and

- [00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=1233) set for you so that it will make your job easier.&nbsp; Both of the GPUs started generating the video. The

- [00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=1240) speed of RTX 5090 is 82 seconds per IT, but I am&nbsp; recording a video, I will stop video recording,

- [00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=1249) restart and show you the real speed and we will&nbsp; also see the speed of the 3090 TI and you can see

- [00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=1255) that both of the GPUs are running right now on my&nbsp; system. If you are wondering, my system, I already

- [00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=1263) have two tutorials on my channel, this one and&nbsp; this one where I have shown my system in details,

- [00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=1269) I will put their link into the description&nbsp; as well, so you can find them easily. Okay,

- [00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=1275) we got two steps in both of the GPUs and 5090 is&nbsp; 70 seconds per IT, and 3090 TI is 183 seconds per

- [00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=1287) IT. Okay, as a next step, I am going to test Wan&nbsp; 2.1 14 billion parameters, 480 pixel model. This

- [00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=1296) model is way faster than 720 pixel model because&nbsp; it is lower resolution. Therefore, this is more

- [00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=1305) proper for consumer GPUs. If you want to use&nbsp; 720 pixel resolution model, you probably need

- [00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=1312) to use it on cloud services like RunPod or Massed&nbsp; Compute, I recommend Massed Compute. So, let's see

- [00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=1319) the 480 pixel model speed. For this model to work,&nbsp; you need to have an input image. So, I already

- [00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=1327) have an input image for testing, it is here, this&nbsp; image and how you should prompt it. For prompting,

- [00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=1335) I am using Claude and how do I use it? You can&nbsp; also use this for free, this is official and

- [00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=1341) free to use on Poe. You can do a lot of prompts,&nbsp; upload the image into here. Then use a prompt like

- [00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=1349) describe this image like a movie scene. It will be&nbsp; used in a image to video model. So let's see what

- [00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=1358) kind of description it will give us. Okay, it gave&nbsp; a lot of, so I will make it more dense, convert

- [00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=1365) it into a single prompt, single line prompt,&nbsp; just describe the action of the scene. Okay,

- [00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=1375) let's see what it is going to give. Sometimes&nbsp; you need to do multiple prompting. Yes. This is

- [00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=1380) for example, what we need, then copy paste it,&nbsp; copy paste it. Okay. We got the model selected,

- [00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=1387) let's select 32 GB, and let's reduce a little bit.&nbsp; Okay and generate, and also this is RTX 3090 TI,

- [00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=1396) so it will be image to video, 24 GB. Let's copy&nbsp; paste, let's select the image as well here and

- [00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=1405) generate. Then let's see the speed and I will&nbsp; stop video and show you actual speed. All right,

- [00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=1410) it has been some time and we got the speeds. The&nbsp; RTX 5090 is 20.5 seconds per IT, and RTX 3090 TI

- [00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=1421) is 55.6 second IT. There is one very crucial thing&nbsp; that you have to be careful, which is selecting

- [00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=1431) the correct aspect ratio for your uploaded image&nbsp; and selecting auto crop or manually cropping your

- [00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=1438) input image. So, pay attention to them, make sure&nbsp; that you have the prompt, you have the correct

- [00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=1443) aspect ratio, the width and height of the image.&nbsp; If you crop yourself, it is better, otherwise,

- [00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=1449) our application will also auto-crop. It is able to&nbsp; auto-crop both input images and input videos. So,

- [00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=1456) I am going to repeat the test for the most heavy&nbsp; demanding model, 14 billion image to video model,

- [00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=1463) 720 pixels. And, I will show you the results. It&nbsp; is exactly same as using the 480 pixel model. So,

- [00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=1470) let's see the speeds. All right, we got the&nbsp; step speeds of the RTX 5090 and 3090 TI. 3090

- [00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=1478) TI is 188 seconds and 5090 is 70 seconds. I have&nbsp; recorded them. So, now, I will begin you showing

- [00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=1489) how to install and use on cloud services, if you&nbsp; don't have a powerful GPU or if you want to scale

- [00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=1495) your generation speed. All right, to use this&nbsp; amazing model on a cloud service Massed Compute,

- [00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=1501) my favorite, first of all, go to the link in the&nbsp; description of the video. You will get to this

- [00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=1506) link and download the attachments zip file from&nbsp; here, or in the attachments you will see the zip

- [00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=1512) file from here, then, extract the zip file into&nbsp; anywhere. Extract, let's open the extraction

- [00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=1520) and you will see that there is Massed Compute&nbsp; instructions .txt file. This is the file that you

- [00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=1526) always need to read. We already have some example&nbsp; to tutorials here. First of all, register to

- [00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=1532) Massed Compute. Please use this link to register.&nbsp; I appreciate that. After registration, go to the

- [00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=1538) billing and add some credits to your account. They&nbsp; also support crypto payment, which is amazing.

- [00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=1544) After that, go to the deploy and you will get&nbsp; to this page. This shows the available GPUs

- [00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=1550) and which GPUs you can use. If you use RTX A6000,&nbsp; currently you need to use at least 2x because the

- [00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=1558) RAM memory of the single image is not enough.&nbsp; I've messaged the team and hopefully they will

- [00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=1564) increase it to 64 GB of RAM memory next week, but&nbsp; so far, until it is increased, you need to use 2,

- [00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=1571) but my recommendation would be L40. This GPU&nbsp; has huge amount of RAM, and also huge amount of

- [00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=1578) storage. As a category, select creator and as an&nbsp; image, select SECourses and you will get my image.

- [00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=1585) Then type our coupon. This will reduce price from&nbsp; 1.05 dollar per hour to only 53 cents. This is an

- [00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=1595) amazing deal, then click Deploy. Once deployed,&nbsp; you will get to this page and you need to wait

- [00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=1601) the status to be initialized. If you haven't used&nbsp; Massed Compute before, you need to use ThinLinc

- [00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=1608) client. Click this link. Download the application&nbsp; according to your operating system. Remember,

- [00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=1614) Massed Compute is a cloud service, so&nbsp; everything will run on a remote machine,

- [00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=1618) not on your computer. I am on Windows, so I will&nbsp; download these Windows. Click it, click Yes,

- [00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=1625) click Next, accept, next, install, then run, then&nbsp; you will get to this page. So, return back to your

- [00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=1632) Massed Compute. Before starting, you need to click&nbsp; Options and go to local devices, uncheck all and

- [00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=1640) check drives, click Details and add a folder here.&nbsp; This will be used to transfer files, but remember,

- [00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=1647) you can only transfer small files, not big ones&nbsp; and make the permission read and write and click

- [00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=1653) okay and click okay and wait for initialization to&nbsp; become green and running. This is super important.

- [00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=1660) This may take between 10 to 15 or 20 minutes. It&nbsp; may sound a lot, but after the initialization has

- [00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=1666) been completed, Massed Compute is the fastest&nbsp; cloud service that you can find and hopefully

- [00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=1671) we will also improve the initialization speed. So&nbsp; the Massed Compute machine has been initialized,

- [00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=1678) let's copy login IP and return back to your&nbsp; ThinLinc client, paste it, copy this username,

- [00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=1684) this is important, paste it, copy your password&nbsp; and paste it. And another thing is that copy your

- [00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=1691) downloaded zip file and go to your Massed Compute&nbsp; share folder, wherever you have set. I have set it

- [00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=1698) here and paste it there, so that you can quickly&nbsp; copy that file into the Massed Compute, you will

- [00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=1704) see and then click Connect and click Continue.&nbsp; You see that there is end existing session,

- [00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=1710) this terminates all of the running applications&nbsp; on Massed Compute. So therefore do not use it

- [00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=1715) unless you need to. Okay, I click it start and&nbsp; it is starting the session. Massed Compute has

- [00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=1721) a desktop interface and this is the Massed Compute&nbsp; interface. We also have other applications you can

- [00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=1727) see. So this is the disk space we have, this&nbsp; is the RAM usage and this is the CPU usage.

- [00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=1731) Open home and after opening home, go to the Thin&nbsp; Drives, go to Massed Compute share it folder, wait

- [00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=1738) for it to load, this is synchronizing with your&nbsp; computer, shared folder. Therefore it may take

- [00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=1744) some time. Do not run anything here or do not&nbsp; transfer big files from here, it won't work. For

- [00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=1751) big files transfer, you need to use like OneDrive,&nbsp; Google Drive, or Hugging Face or such. So,

- [00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=1756) our installer is here, you see, Wan 2.1 v7.&nbsp; Drag and drop it into the downloads folder,

- [00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=1763) wait for copy and then right click and&nbsp; extract here. Then enter inside the folder,

- [00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=1769) open Massed Compute instructions read .txt file.&nbsp; First of all, we will begin installation. So,

- [00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=1775) copy this with control C, open a new terminal&nbsp; and when you get asked of this click Cancel,

- [00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=1781) you don't need to and then click paste. Remember&nbsp; that you have opened the command line interface

- [00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=1788) in the same folder. You see Downloads Wan&nbsp; 2.1 version seven. This is how you can start

- [00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=1794) installation. Wait for Wan 2.1 folder appear, yes,&nbsp; like this, then return back to the instructions,

- [00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=1801) copy this part, Control C and click open terminal.&nbsp; How do I open terminal inside that folder? You see

- [00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=1808) these three dots, open terminal and paste it.&nbsp; And it will ask you which models to download.

- [00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=1814) Let's download 2.1 14 billion parameters model&nbsp; as a test. So it is option four and hit Enter.

- [00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=1822) And the download speed of the Massed Compute&nbsp; is just mind-blowing, let's see in real time.

- [00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=1828) So, it took only 18 seconds for 10 GB of file,&nbsp; yes, it is around 1,000 megabytes per second. So,

- [00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=1836) the downloads of the models are really&nbsp; fast. The installation is also really fast,

- [00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=1841) just wait for installation to be completed. Okay,&nbsp; so the installation has been completed on Massed

- [00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=1846) Compute. How do I know? You will see that virtual&nbsp; environment made and installed properly. The model

- [00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=1852) has already been downloaded. So, return back to&nbsp; Instructions .txt file and copy this prompt. This

- [00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=1860) is for starting the interface, copy it, it will&nbsp; start the application. Return back to the folder

- [00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=1866) and click three dots and open another terminal and&nbsp; paste it. Now, this is going to start the Wan 2.1

- [00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=1873) application and we will be able to use it in our&nbsp; computer or in our tablet, in our phone, anywhere.

- [00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=1881) You see there is this URL, I will copy it and I&nbsp; will use it in my own computer rather than inside

- [00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=1887) the Massed Compute. So, copy paste it and you see&nbsp; the interface is loading in my computer and yes,

- [00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=1894) this is running on a cloud machine on Massed&nbsp; Compute, but I can use it in my computer. So,

- [00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=1900) let's use our downloaded model, let's select the&nbsp; GPU, this is the GPU preset. The usage is same

- [00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=1909) as in Windows, so I will copy paste this, verify&nbsp; your resolution, aspect ratio and everything and

- [00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=1915) click generate. Then it will load the model and&nbsp; start generation to see the progress, return back

- [00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=1921) to your Thin Link client and watch the interface,&nbsp; the command line interface here, let's see what

- [00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=1928) is happening. We can also start nvitop, so open&nbsp; a new terminal like this and type nvitop. Okay,

- [00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=1935) it is loading the model right now. We can see&nbsp; the VRAM usage is increasing. Yes, you see my

- [00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=1941) presets are really optimized. It is using almost&nbsp; entire VRAM. It will take some time on this GPU,

- [00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=1949) but we will see the speed and generation results.&nbsp; So, our generation on Massed Compute has been

- [00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=1955) completed. This is the video. I mean, it worked&nbsp; really decent if we consider the, if we consider

- [00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=1961) the prompt. This is a very weird prompt and it&nbsp; worked really, really well. To download the model,

- [00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=1967) you can use this icon. It will download into your&nbsp; computer. If you generated many videos and if you

- [00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=1972) want to download all of them at once, go to&nbsp; your installation folder, Wan 2.1, Wan 2.1,

- [00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=1978) enter inside output and copy the videos that you&nbsp; want or you can just copy the outputs entirely,

- [00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=1986) move it into the Thin Drives, paste into your&nbsp; synchronization folder, let me demonstrate you.

- [00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=1992) So, I will paste it here with control V and it&nbsp; is copied here, wait for copy to be completed,

- [00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=1998) it may take some time. Then go back to your&nbsp; synchronization folder and it will appear

- [00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=2003) here. So, then copy them into your computer and&nbsp; it will be synchronized as you are seeing right

- [00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=2009) now. On Massed Compute, you have to terminate your&nbsp; machine, there is no stop or resume feature. So,

- [00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=2016) go back to your running instances here&nbsp; and click this terminate icon. However,

- [00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=2022) be careful because when you do that everything&nbsp; will be deleted permanently, there is no restore

- [00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=2029) back, there is no recovery, nothing. So make&nbsp; sure that you did backup everything and then

- [00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=2035) click this icon and it will delete it. And you&nbsp; see we only paid 50 cents for per hour. So this

- [00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=2040) is a great pricing and let's just delete. If&nbsp; you want a faster generation on Massed Compute,

- [00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=2046) the recommended GPUs will be H100 or A100, or you&nbsp; can use L40s, but it is not as fast as these other

- [00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=2055) ones. However, you can also rent multiple A6000 or&nbsp; L40s and start application on each one of them and

- [00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=2064) generate multiple videos on different started&nbsp; applications at the same time, in parallel.

- [00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=2070) That is also perfectly possible. How to do that?&nbsp; Open your Massed Compute instruction files and

- [00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=2076) you are going to add a command here, like export&nbsp; CUDA visible devices equal to 1. So, once you

- [00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=2085) start your application like this, it will run on&nbsp; the GPU ID 1. If you make it 0, it will run on

- [00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=2091) the GPU ID 0. If you make it 2, it will run on the&nbsp; GPU ID 2. So, let's say you have rented four GPUs

- [00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=2098) and you can start four applications like this&nbsp; and each one will run on a different GPU. So,

- [00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=2103) you will be able to generate multiple videos&nbsp; at once. Keep watching the video. Alright,

- [00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=2108) now I will show you how to use this amazing&nbsp; model on a cloud service RunPod. This is one

- [00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=2114) another favorite cloud service. Click the link&nbsp; in the description of the video to open this

- [00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=2119) page. Remember to watch the Windows tutorial&nbsp; part to learn how to use the application. So,

- [00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=2124) download the installer from here or from the&nbsp; attachments you will see here. After downloading

- [00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=2129) the attachments, extract it into any folder and&nbsp; enter inside the folder and you will see that

- [00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=2136) there is RunPod instructions read txt file,&nbsp; open it. I recommend you to register with my

- [00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=2143) link if you haven't yet. I appreciate that. After&nbsp; registration, go to the login with sign up button,

- [00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=2149) then go to the billing and add some balance&nbsp; to your account. After you have added account,

- [00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=2155) some balance, after that go to the pods and click&nbsp; deploy. Now, which GPU you need to use? On RunPod,

- [00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=2162) you can use pretty much every GPU, but according&nbsp; to your GPU, your speed will be slow or fast. So,

- [00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=2169) I recommend to use at least L40S because&nbsp; it has the sufficient RAM and also VRAM,

- [00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=2175) a little bit sufficient VRAM, not fully, but&nbsp; still it will be good. If you want faster speed,

- [00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=2181) you can use H100 PCI or you can use A100&nbsp; PCI Express as well. Let's go with H100 PCI

- [00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=2189) Express. Click change template and type Pytorch&nbsp; like this and select the Pytorch 2.2.0. This is

- [00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=2198) the template that you need. Click edit template.&nbsp; I really recommend to add a lot of space, if you

- [00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=2204) want to test especially all of the apps, let's&nbsp; add like 300 gigabytes. This is super important,

- [00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=2210) set and then click deploy on demand. Then click&nbsp; my pods. You can also click your pods here. Verify

- [00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=2216) that your machine has sufficient RAM. How much&nbsp; RAM is sufficient? At least 96 gigabytes of RAM, I

- [00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=2223) recommend to get. It will make it faster and wait&nbsp; for pod to be initialized. How you will know it is

- [00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=2230) initialized? The connect button will appear here.&nbsp; You can also refresh this page if you want to see

- [00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=2237) and connect appeared. Then click connect and click&nbsp; connect to Jupyter Lab. You see this interface,

- [00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=2244) click it. This will open the Jupyter Lab interface&nbsp; of the RunPod. Remember, this is running on a

- [00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=2250) cloud machine, not on your computer. Wait for this&nbsp; interface to be loaded. If this interface doesn't

- [00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=2255) load, you need to get a new pod and you may&nbsp; encounter broken pods on RunPod a lot. Moreover,

- [00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=2261) if you want even more cheaper prices, you can&nbsp; go with community cloud. However, this can be

- [00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=2266) extremely slow or more probably broken pod. Then&nbsp; click this icon for upload. Upload the downloaded

- [00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=2273) zip file into the workspace. Once the upload has&nbsp; been completed, right click and click extract

- [00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=2279) archive. It will extract all of the content. Click&nbsp; this to refresh. Then double click and open RunPod

- [00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=2285) instructions txt file. This is the installation&nbsp; command. Copy this, open a new terminal like

- [00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=2292) this and paste it and hit enter. This will start&nbsp; installation. Wait a little bit until you see the

- [00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=2299) folder of Wan 2.1 here. Let's see, let's just wait&nbsp; a little bit more. If you stop your pod and resume

- [00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=2306) later, you need to run this installation again. It&nbsp; will be way faster second time, but remember that.

- [00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=2313) Okay, now we see that Wan 2.1 folder arrived. We&nbsp; can begin downloading models. So for downloading

- [00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=2321) models, copy this, you see download, open a new&nbsp; terminal and paste it. You can also right click

- [00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=2327) and paste and it will ask you allow and it will&nbsp; paste and hit enter. Now, which models you want to

- [00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=2333) download? It will ask you. This is exactly as in&nbsp; the Windows tutorial part. So for demonstration,

- [00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=2338) let's download the option four, 14 billion&nbsp; parameters text to video model. You will notice

- [00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=2345) that I am optimizing the downloader extremely well&nbsp; and therefore the download speed will be really,

- [00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=2352) really fast. Let me show you the download&nbsp; speed. Yes, it is 400 megabytes per second,

- [00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=2357) 1 gigabyte per second, 1.5 gigabyte per second&nbsp; because our pod is a good pod, expensive pod and

- [00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=2364) I am optimizing the download speed. If I didn't&nbsp; optimize it, it would be only 40 megabytes per

- [00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=2371) second. You see the difference? It is huge.&nbsp; And then we need to wait for installation to

- [00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=2375) be completed. Installation may take huge time&nbsp; on RunPod. It totally depends on your pod and

- [00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=2381) on RunPod, hard drives are usually very, very&nbsp; slow compared to the Massed Compute. Okay,

- [00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=2387) so the installation on RunPod has been completed.&nbsp; How do you know? You see virtual environment made

- [00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=2394) and installed properly. After installation has&nbsp; been completed and you have downloaded the models,

- [00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=2399) you need to copy this command with Control C, open&nbsp; a new terminal and paste it and it will start the

- [00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=2407) Gradio interface that we can use from our phone,&nbsp; tablet, TV, wherever you want. It will be Gradio

- [00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=2414) live share. If you don't want to use Gradio live&nbsp; share, you can add 7860 port as a proxy and use

- [00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=2421) it, but I recommend Gradio live share. Click&nbsp; this link, you see. It will open the Gradio live

- [00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=2426) share. Then the rest is totally exactly same as&nbsp; in the Windows tutorial part. But as a beginning,

- [00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=2434) let's try and see the speed. So, I selected&nbsp; this and since this is a powerful GPU, I am

- [00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=2440) going to use 80 gigabyte and I am going to disable&nbsp; tiled VAE, so it will be fast. And as a prompt,

- [00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=2448) let's try this prompt. Generate. Yes. And let's&nbsp; see the speed on H100 GPU. Okay, you can monitor

- [00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=2458) the status on here. Let's also open a nvitop to&nbsp; see, pip install nvitop, nvitop and we can see,

- [00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=2470) yes, it is already starting to load. Okay. Wow,&nbsp; this machine is really fast. Let's see the step

- [00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=2477) speed. This is running on cloud machine, not on my&nbsp; computer. Always remember that. It is using 43.10

- [00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=2487) gigabytes of VRAM memory. Okay, we got the first&nbsp; step. It is 57 second per IT. It is not really

- [00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=2497) that fast, unfortunately, as fast as we expected.&nbsp; So, therefore, you can also get L40S GPU and pay

- [00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=2507) lesser. It is up to you, but this is the speed&nbsp; on H100 GPU for the very best model. Therefore,

- [00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=2514) you can get an L40S GPU and get similar speed,&nbsp; pay lesser and really generate a lot of images.

- [00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=2521) For example, I started eight GPUs and I am going&nbsp; to generate on eight GPUs to prepare some of the

- [00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=2528) examples that you have seen in the beginning of&nbsp; the tutorial video. So, that is how I am scaling

- [00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=2536) my generations using multiple GPUs. I am going&nbsp; to download all of the models here. And how I

- [00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=2543) am going to do that? I am going to assign a GPU&nbsp; to every instance. It will be like export CUDA

- [00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=2552) visible devices equal to 1, 2, 3, 4. So, each&nbsp; one will run on the different GPU. Therefore,

- [00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=2560) I will be able to generate multiple videos&nbsp; in parallel. This works on Massed Compute

- [00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=2566) as well. This works everywhere, on Windows&nbsp; as well. In Windows, it is set, not export,

- [00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=2571) but this is the logic. So, this is the logic of&nbsp; using RunPod, exactly same as in the Windows part.

- [00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=2579) You just make the installation as this way and&nbsp; you generate and you download things you want. So,

- [00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=2585) our RunPod generation has been completed. We&nbsp; can see the time it took and we got the result.

- [00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=2593) The result is just mind blowingly amazing. It is&nbsp; extremely high quality as you are seeing, really,

- [00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=2600) really good from this description. I really like&nbsp; it. So, how you can download it? Click here and

- [00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=2607) it will download the video into your computer&nbsp; or or go to the workspace, Wan 2.1 folder and

- [00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=2614) outputs. Right click and download as an archive&nbsp; and it will download all of the generated videos

- [00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=2621) inside a zip file like this. So, you can open and&nbsp; see them. If you don't want to spend any money,

- [00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=2627) you can stop your pod from here, click stop and&nbsp; stop. It will use minimum amount of money. Then

- [00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=2634) you can resume with start and just run the&nbsp; installer again. It will be very quick and

- [00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=2640) start again. If you don't want to spend any money,&nbsp; just terminate, but this will delete everything

- [00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=2646) forever. So, be careful with that, just terminate.&nbsp; If you want to use storage system of the RunPod,

- [00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=2653) I have a full tutorial for that. Into the&nbsp; YouTube, type SECourses RunPod Network and

- [00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=2660) you will get to this tutorial. This tutorial shows&nbsp; you how to use permanent network storage system,

- [00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAhveNy-8s&t=2667) if you need permanent network storage system on&nbsp; RunPod. Thank you so much for watching. Hopefully,
