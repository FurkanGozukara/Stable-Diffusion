### Video Transcription


- [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBBxVUcci7I&t=0) Hello everyone. In this video, I am going to&nbsp; show you how to clone your existing C drive&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBBxVUcci7I&t=5) into your newly purchased disk with bootable&nbsp; features. Currently, I have Netac 2TB NVMe SSD,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBBxVUcci7I&t=14) and I have just purchased Samsung 990 Pro with&nbsp; heatsink 4TB, and I am going to clone my existing&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBBxVUcci7I&t=24) C drive into this new Samsung drive by using open&nbsp; source Clonezilla. Clonezilla is an open source&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBBxVUcci7I&t=32) disk imaging and cloning software. It is totally&nbsp; free to use. So this tutorial will be valid&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBBxVUcci7I&t=39) every time whenever you are watching this. Just&nbsp; click this download section here, and in here,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBBxVUcci7I&t=44) we are going to download a disk image where we can&nbsp; write into the flash disk. You need to have a USB&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBBxVUcci7I&t=53) disk for this to work, and then we will start that&nbsp; USB disk from the BIOS. Click this stable 3.1.2&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBBxVUcci7I&t=61) version. In here make sure that you have selected&nbsp; amd64, download as a ISO file from here,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBBxVUcci7I&t=68) and click download. Then we are going to burn this&nbsp; ISO file into the USB disk by using Rufus. So just&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBBxVUcci7I&t=76) type Rufus into your browser, go to the downloads&nbsp; of Rufus, and download the portable exe from here.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBBxVUcci7I&t=84) I will put the links of these files into the&nbsp; description of the video, so don't worry about&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBBxVUcci7I&t=89) that. And we can see both files are downloaded.&nbsp; Let's open Rufus. OK, click no. Then select your&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBBxVUcci7I&t=96) USB device from here. Select your downloaded ISO&nbsp; from here, which is Clonezilla. Then you don't&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBBxVUcci7I&t=101) need to change anything. Everything is ready.&nbsp; Just start. This will burn this ISO file into&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBBxVUcci7I&t=108) the USB so we can boot our Clonezilla in the&nbsp; BIOS. You will see that it is pretty fast. So&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBBxVUcci7I&t=117) these settings are extremely important. They are&nbsp; automatically set. Make sure that you are using&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBBxVUcci7I&t=123) the same settings when burning ISO into the USB&nbsp; disk. OK, everything is ready. Now I need to just&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBBxVUcci7I&t=130) mount my newly purchased disk into my motherboard&nbsp; and start from USB from BIOS. I will switch to the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBBxVUcci7I&t=138) BIOS recording right now. OK, now I am going to&nbsp; enter the boot menu with the F12, and in here,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBBxVUcci7I&t=144) I am going to select my SanDisk, which is my USB&nbsp; disk as you are seeing. So after we generated the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBBxVUcci7I&t=151) USB disk, we need to enter the boot menu. Right&nbsp; now on the left part of the screen, you will see&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBBxVUcci7I&t=158) that there are these options. In here, I am going&nbsp; to select the Clonezilla Live VGA with large font&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBBxVUcci7I&t=166) and to RAM option. The third option, then you will&nbsp; see that it will start loading like this. OK,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBBxVUcci7I&t=172) since my monitor is very big, it is displaying&nbsp; like this, but I am just going to select English&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBBxVUcci7I&t=177) and hit enter. Then I am just going to hit enter.&nbsp; Keep the default keyboard layout that it will get&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBBxVUcci7I&t=184) fixed in a moment. OK, now start following me very&nbsp; carefully. Start Clonezilla. In here, we are going&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBBxVUcci7I&t=190) to select device to device. The second option,&nbsp; which is extremely important because we are going&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBBxVUcci7I&t=197) to clone our device into another device, then it&nbsp; will scan all of the disks at the left bottom of&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBBxVUcci7I&t=203) the screen. You can see that it is finding all&nbsp; disks, finding all partitions. You may also get&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBBxVUcci7I&t=209) some error or warning messages. They are not&nbsp; important. OK, in this screen, we are going to&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBBxVUcci7I&t=213) select expert. Don't you worry. In here, we are&nbsp; going to select disk to local disk, local disk&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBBxVUcci7I&t=219) to local disk clone. Do not select part to local&nbsp; part, local partition to local partition. Select&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBBxVUcci7I&t=226) disk to local disk, local disk to local disk&nbsp; clone. So the first option, select with enter,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBBxVUcci7I&t=232) then it will find all disk and partitions at the&nbsp; left bottom of the screen. You can see that. OK,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBBxVUcci7I&t=238) now we are going to select the source disk.&nbsp; When you read the choose local disk as source,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBBxVUcci7I&t=244) you will understand that you are selecting this&nbsp; source disk, which is our C drive. In this case,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBBxVUcci7I&t=249) so my C drive is the Netac. The second disk, it&nbsp; may be different in your case. Make sure that&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBBxVUcci7I&t=255) you have selected the accurate source disk. This&nbsp; is super important. So I am going to select the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBBxVUcci7I&t=260) Netac as my source disk. Then you will see on the&nbsp; left bottom finding all disk and partitions. Now&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBBxVUcci7I&t=266) you will see choose local disk as target. This is&nbsp; extremely important. It says that all data on the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBBxVUcci7I&t=272) entire disk will be lost. So this is our new disk.&nbsp; The disk that we are going to move our&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBBxVUcci7I&t=278) existing disk into the new one. So this will be&nbsp; my new disk. This is 4TB Samsung SSD 990 Pro. So&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBBxVUcci7I&t=286) I am going to select this disk as my target disk.&nbsp; So this is choose local disk as target. This is&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBBxVUcci7I&t=292) super important. So in this screen, do not change&nbsp; anything. Just hit OK. This is super important. In&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBBxVUcci7I&t=298) this screen also, you don't need anything. Just&nbsp; say skip checking repairing source file system.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBBxVUcci7I&t=304) OK, this screen is also super important. This is&nbsp; the advanced parameters that we are going to set&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBBxVUcci7I&t=311) as you can see. So in this screen, we are going to&nbsp; select create partition table proportionally. What&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBBxVUcci7I&t=318) does this mean? This means that since our source&nbsp; disk is 2TB and our target disk is 4TB, we have&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBBxVUcci7I&t=325) to expand the partition table. So in this case,&nbsp; select create partition table proportionally,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBBxVUcci7I&t=332) which is the option 3. This is super important. Do&nbsp; not skip this part. And in here, in this case, I&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBBxVUcci7I&t=337) will choose reboot, shutdown, etc. when everything&nbsp; is finished because I want to see everything that&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBBxVUcci7I&t=343) was happened. So I will select this option, then&nbsp; it will ask you to enter to continue on the left&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBBxVUcci7I&t=349) bottom, then it will show you one more time that&nbsp; did you select the disks accurately. So it says&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBBxVUcci7I&t=354) that warning the existing data in this hard disk&nbsp; partitions will be overwritten. Which one? It shows&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBBxVUcci7I&t=361) which ones will be overwritten. It is displaying&nbsp; me that 4TB Samsung SSD 990 Pro. It is accurate.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBBxVUcci7I&t=370) I am going to delete all the data on the 990 Pro,&nbsp; which is the new disk with the information from my&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBBxVUcci7I&t=376) C drive. Verify everything, and then hit the yes&nbsp; key. It is asking you to do that and hit enter.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBBxVUcci7I&t=381) Then it will ask you one more time to be sure. Are&nbsp; you sure that you want to delete all the data on&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBBxVUcci7I&t=387) the Samsung SSD 990 Pro? I am sure. So I am going&nbsp; to hit yes and hit enter. Then it will start the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBBxVUcci7I&t=394) cloning the disk. The amazing part of Clonezilla&nbsp; is that it is totally free. So whenever you&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBBxVUcci7I&t=400) are watching this video, it should work. After a&nbsp; while, you will start seeing the cloning progress&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBBxVUcci7I&t=406) like this case. It is pretty fast since my both&nbsp; of the disks are extremely fast disks. Currently,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBBxVUcci7I&t=413) my cloning speed is 72.5 GB per minute. So&nbsp; this is per minute speed. So per second,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBBxVUcci7I&t=423) it is over 1.5 GB per second. The cloning has&nbsp; been completed, and there is one very crucial&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBBxVUcci7I&t=431) step that I suggest you to do. As you see, it says&nbsp; remember to remove the source disk or the cloned&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBBxVUcci7I&t=437) destination disk before you boot this machine.&nbsp; Otherwise, when two identical systems exist on the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBBxVUcci7I&t=445) same machine, the restored operating system will&nbsp; be confused, and booting might fail. Therefore,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBBxVUcci7I&t=451) now I am going to remove the original disk and&nbsp; boot into the Windows, verify everything. Then I&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBBxVUcci7I&t=457) will mount back again my other disk and go to the&nbsp; BIOS and set the booting device. So with this way,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBBxVUcci7I&t=466) I will be able to utilize both of the disks at the&nbsp; same time. So after you hit enter at that screen,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBBxVUcci7I&t=472) you will see power off, which I am going&nbsp; to do. Before I continue into the Windows,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBBxVUcci7I&t=478) there is extremely one more crucial thing. In&nbsp; the BIOS, you have to set the new cloned disk&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBBxVUcci7I&t=485) as the first booting disk from the drive option&nbsp; priorities, or you have to put it into the place&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBBxVUcci7I&t=492) of the original disk. Otherwise, you won't be able&nbsp; to boot up with the new cloned disk. Currently I am not&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBBxVUcci7I&t=499) able to set driver option priorities because in&nbsp; my motherboard, I have to use VMD setup for Raid&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBBxVUcci7I&t=508) Storage Technology. Therefore, I switched the&nbsp; places with the new disk and the old disk. So&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBBxVUcci7I&t=514) in the first slot of my motherboard, there is&nbsp; the new SSD right now. Therefore, the BIOS is&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBBxVUcci7I&t=521) booting up the system with the newly cloned disk.&nbsp; I also did set the boot manager for the new disk.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBBxVUcci7I&t=527) This took me many hours to figure out. So I am&nbsp; giving you this extremely crucial information&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBBxVUcci7I&t=533) before we continue to start using both of the&nbsp; disks at the same time on the Windows. So the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBBxVUcci7I&t=538) Windows has started, and now we are ready to use&nbsp; both of the disks. However, the older C drive is&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBBxVUcci7I&t=546) not visible or available right now. Because it is&nbsp; by default set to the offline disk by the Windows&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBBxVUcci7I&t=554) when booting. So we go to the computer management,&nbsp; storage, disk management as usual. And in here,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBBxVUcci7I&t=561) we are going to make it online from here. So set&nbsp; it online. By the way, I suggest you to format&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBBxVUcci7I&t=570) this disk to not have any confliction. However,&nbsp; before formatting it, you should verify whether&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBBxVUcci7I&t=578) all of the files are accurately copied or not.&nbsp; For this verification, I have a self-developed&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBBxVUcci7I&t=587) C sharp application. It is fully multithreaded and&nbsp; working amazing. The link of this post will be in&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBBxVUcci7I&t=593) the description of the video. The link contains&nbsp; both compiled exe file and the full source code.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBBxVUcci7I&t=600) So let's download the full source code to be&nbsp; able to show you the source code and how to use&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBBxVUcci7I&t=606) it. For downloading the source code. Click here.&nbsp; It will start downloading the source code. I will&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBBxVUcci7I&t=611) extract it into my another disk, so there won't&nbsp; be unnecessary files when comparing. Just double&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBBxVUcci7I&t=620) click the .sln file. You need to have Visual&nbsp; Studio installed to start and run this application&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBBxVUcci7I&t=627) with C sharp. You can see the entire source code&nbsp; in here. All you need to do is just start it. Then&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBBxVUcci7I&t=634) enter the source path and the destination path.&nbsp; Let me show you. By the way, I will start as administrator.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBBxVUcci7I&t=641) So let's open the folder, and the inside debug. For&nbsp; these files to be generated, you need to one time&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBBxVUcci7I&t=647) start it or right-click and rebuild the solution.&nbsp; And in here, right-click and run as administrator.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBBxVUcci7I&t=654) So I did start it as administrator, which was&nbsp; my original disk. It was local drive F. So enter&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBBxVUcci7I&t=661) here F, and the destination is C. And then all you&nbsp; need to do is just click start verification. First&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBBxVUcci7I&t=669) of all, it will fetch all of the files in both of&nbsp; the disks. This program has continue feature, so&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBBxVUcci7I&t=676) you can close it and start verification again. It&nbsp; will skip the files that it has already compared.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBBxVUcci7I&t=685) Right now, it is reading all of the files and&nbsp; folders from both of the disks. So we need to&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBBxVUcci7I&t=691) just wait a little bit until the software read&nbsp; all of the file structure in both of the disks&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBBxVUcci7I&t=697) to start comparing them. So it started comparison.&nbsp; It fetched all of the files in both of the disks.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBBxVUcci7I&t=705) It says that there are four hundred forty-five&nbsp; not having elements. So let's see them. You&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBBxVUcci7I&t=712) will see there are generated text files here. Byte&nbsp; compared files list. It will use this as tracking&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBBxVUcci7I&t=720) the number of files compared or not. Then you will&nbsp; see that there are error bytes not matching list.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBBxVUcci7I&t=726) This is the list that will show you not accurately&nbsp; cloned files or corrupted. You will see file read&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBBxVUcci7I&t=734) errors. Some files may not be available to read,&nbsp; such as these ones. And you will see first folder&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBBxVUcci7I&t=741) does not have: This means that the first disk does&nbsp; not have these files, which are, as you can see,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBBxVUcci7I&t=747) recycle bin files. And there are also some program&nbsp; files. Probably these were all generated after I restarted&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBBxVUcci7I&t=755) my computer, as you can see. So none of these are&nbsp; important files. As you can see, these are all&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBBxVUcci7I&t=760) Microsoft Office updates, and these are the logs.&nbsp; So there are no missing files after our cloning.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBBxVUcci7I&t=767) It worked perfectly. Now all I need to just wait&nbsp; is bytes check completed and bytes check nonmatching.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBBxVUcci7I&t=776) If the nonmatching is zero, that means the cloning&nbsp; was 100% successful, and we cloned everything&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBBxVUcci7I&t=783) very accurately. The file verification has been&nbsp; completed. There are only 252 nonmatching files,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBBxVUcci7I&t=791) and I check at them, and these are all actively&nbsp; modified files, such as these ones. So there are&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBBxVUcci7I&t=797) no issues. Therefore, now I am going to delete&nbsp; the entire partition of the previous C drive,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBBxVUcci7I&t=803) which is now F drive, and prevent further&nbsp; confliction with my new C drive, and I will&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBBxVUcci7I&t=809) be able to use the older drive as a new drive. The&nbsp; regular format will not work. Therefore, we have&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBBxVUcci7I&t=815) to delete the partitions. So let's take the disk&nbsp; offline. To delete the partitions of that disk,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBBxVUcci7I&t=822) we have to use DiskPart. So to do that, start&nbsp; a command window with administrator. So run as&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBBxVUcci7I&t=828) administrator, then we need to first move to&nbsp; the DiskPart. So I type diskpart like this,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBBxVUcci7I&t=836) follow me carefully. Then we will do list disk,&nbsp; and you will see that the offline disk is 4,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBBxVUcci7I&t=845) which is my current only offline disk. I can see&nbsp; that here disk 4 is offline. Also, the number&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBBxVUcci7I&t=851) is matching here. Make sure that you are selecting&nbsp; the accurate disk. Then what I need to do is&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBBxVUcci7I&t=856) select a disk with select disk 4, then I can&nbsp; list the partitions or do a clean. Let's list the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBBxVUcci7I&t=867) partitions, list partition. And you see there are&nbsp; three partitions, recovery, system, and reserved.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBBxVUcci7I&t=874) And we can verify whether it is accurate or not.&nbsp; When we check the partitions, we see there are&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBBxVUcci7I&t=880) 3 partitions, and it is looking accurate. Then&nbsp; what I need to do is just type clean command, and&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBBxVUcci7I&t=888) it will delete all of the partitions. OK. It says&nbsp; that we have to take it back to the online. So&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBBxVUcci7I&t=895) let's make it online. Then let's try clean again.&nbsp; OK. It says that it was successful, and yes, all&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBBxVUcci7I&t=903) of the partitions are deleted. Now what I'm going&nbsp; to do is initialize disk like this. OK. And select&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBBxVUcci7I&t=913) new volume. Give any letter you wish. Let's make&nbsp; it F. Let's make it as Netac 2TB and finish. And&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBBxVUcci7I&t=926) now we have the Netac disk, which was my original&nbsp; disk as a clean zeroed disk like this. As a last step,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBBxVUcci7I&t=936) I have compared both of the disks speeds with&nbsp; Crystal Disk Mark. You see the new Samsung SSD 990&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBBxVUcci7I&t=944) Pro with heatsink is able to get 7GB per second&nbsp; reading, 7GB per second writing. These are the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBBxVUcci7I&t=952) test results as you are seeing, and the Netac 2TB&nbsp; is able to almost get same speeds. So both of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBBxVUcci7I&t=960) disks are working in excellence. I hope you have&nbsp; enjoyed. I tried to give you a lot of information,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBBxVUcci7I&t=966) and it took me like a day to record this&nbsp; video because I had a lot of issues during the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBBxVUcci7I&t=974) initialization due to my RAM setup or other stuff.&nbsp; Hopefully, see you in future amazing tutorials.
