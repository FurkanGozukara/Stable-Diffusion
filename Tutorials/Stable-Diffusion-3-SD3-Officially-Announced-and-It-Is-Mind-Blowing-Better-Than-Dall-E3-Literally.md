Stable Diffusion 3 by Stability AI announced just today. So In this video I have shown 16 SD-3 examples with their prompts and I have compared each example and prompt with Dall E3. Dall-E3 is known to be ultimate prompt follower. However, Stable Diffusion 3 (SD 3) has literally crushed Dall E3 at prompt following. This is just revolutionary. The next stage of text to image AI starts.

Announcing Stable Diffusion 3 in early preview, our most capable text-to-image model with greatly improved performance in multi-subject prompts, image quality, and spelling abilities.

While the model is not yet broadly available, today, we are opening the waitlist for an early preview. This preview phase, as with previous models, is crucial for gathering insights to improve its performance and safety ahead of an open release.

The Stable Diffusion 3 suite of models currently range from 800M to 8B parameters. This approach aims to align with our core values and democratize access, providing users with a variety of options for scalability and quality to best meet their creative needs. Stable Diffusion 3 combines a diffusion transformer architecture and flow matching. We will publish a detailed technical report soon.

We believe in safe, responsible AI practices. This means we have taken and continue to take reasonable steps to prevent the misuse of Stable Diffusion 3 by bad actors. Safety starts when we begin training our model and continues throughout the testing, evaluation, and deployment. In preparation for this early preview, we’ve introduced numerous safeguards. By continually collaborating with researchers, experts, and our community, we expect to innovate further with integrity as we approach the model’s public release.

Our commitment to ensuring generative AI is open, safe, and universally accessible remains steadfast. With Stable Diffusion 3, we strive to offer adaptable solutions that enable individuals, developers, and enterprises to unleash their creativity, aligning with our mission to activate humanity’s potential.



### Video Transcription


- [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJxodszsERo&t=0) Greetings, everyone. Stable Diffusion 3&nbsp; (SD3) by Stability AI announced today.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJxodszsERo&t=5) Official announcement. This article will be in the&nbsp; description of the video. Also, this is a public&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJxodszsERo&t=10) article. You don't need to be a supporter of my&nbsp; Patreon. Moreover, in this video, I am going to&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJxodszsERo&t=16) show you 16 Stability AI staff released SD3 Stable&nbsp; Diffusion 3 images, and I will compare them with&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJxodszsERo&t=24) the Dall-E3 inside my ChatGPT Plus 4 account.&nbsp; You see, I have generated all the 16 images. So,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJxodszsERo&t=33) let's begin. This is the prompt 1. You see how&nbsp; well it is able to follow the prompt. It is just&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJxodszsERo&t=39) amazing. Now, let's compare it with the Dall-E3.&nbsp; This is the Dall-E3 image. I think Dall-E3 also&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJxodszsERo&t=46) performed really well on this prompt. But Stable&nbsp; Diffusion 3 also performed very well. The second&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJxodszsERo&t=52) prompt is this one. You see how well it is able to&nbsp; follow the prompt. Let's see Dall-E3 generation. I&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJxodszsERo&t=59) think Stable Diffusion 3 is better at this prompt.&nbsp; It followed the prompt better. Prompt 3 is an&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJxodszsERo&t=65) amazingly hard prompt. You see the prompt here and&nbsp; you see the generated image. Let's see Dall-E3.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJxodszsERo&t=71) Dall-E3 also performed really good, but you see&nbsp; Dall-E3 has a stylized like a 3D render output.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJxodszsERo&t=80) However, when we look at the Stable Diffusion&nbsp; 3, it is more natural. It is looking more like&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJxodszsERo&t=86) a real. And this was always the case. The problem&nbsp; with the Dall-E3, Dall-E3 always generated like a&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJxodszsERo&t=92) drawing, like a 3D output. Okay, let's see the&nbsp; prompt for this really hard prompt. You see the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJxodszsERo&t=98) prompt here and you see the image. It is amazing.&nbsp; It is able to follow the prompt very well. Let's&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJxodszsERo&t=104) look at the Dall-E3. Dall-E3 is way behind at&nbsp; this prompt, as you are seeing right now. Stable&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJxodszsERo&t=111) Diffusion 3 followed the prompt much better,&nbsp; especially with the text. So, let's look at the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJxodszsERo&t=116) next prompt. You see the generated image, and the&nbsp; prompt is amazing. The Stable Diffusion 3 prompt&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJxodszsERo&t=122) following is just mind-blowing. Let's look at the&nbsp; Dall-E3. And you see, this is the Dall-E3 output.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJxodszsERo&t=128) Dall-E3 is way behind at realism from the Stable&nbsp; Diffusion 3. Let's look at the next prompt. This&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJxodszsERo&t=136) is a really hard prompt, as you are seeing right&nbsp; now. Just pause the video and read the prompt if&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJxodszsERo&t=141) you wish. I am not going to spend your time with&nbsp; reading. And let's look at the Dall-E3 generated&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJxodszsERo&t=147) image. You see Stable Diffusion 3 is much better&nbsp; at following this prompt as well. Let's look at&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJxodszsERo&t=153) the next prompt. This is a rather easy prompt,&nbsp; and let's see the generated image. I say Stable&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJxodszsERo&t=159) Diffusion 3 is much better at this one as well.&nbsp; You see this is like a drawing. However, Stable&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJxodszsERo&t=164) Diffusion 3 is generating like a real image. And&nbsp; there is nothing indicates a drawing, a 3D, a render&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJxodszsERo&t=171) in the prompt. So it should be real. But Dall-E3&nbsp; is failing at generating real images. Okay,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJxodszsERo&t=178) let's look at the next prompt. So you see this&nbsp; is a really hard, really complex prompt. And the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJxodszsERo&t=183) composition of the image is amazing. Let's look at&nbsp; the output of the Dall-E3. Dall-E3 is nothing, nothing like&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJxodszsERo&t=190) the Stable Diffusion 3 at this prompt. Okay, here&nbsp; another prompt. You see the output. It is able to&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJxodszsERo&t=198) follow the prompts magnificently. And let's look&nbsp; at the output of the Dall-E3. You see Dall-E3 is&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJxodszsERo&t=205) much much primitive and not realistic like Stable&nbsp; Diffusion 3. Okay, here another prompt. And this&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJxodszsERo&t=213) prompt is mind-blowing. You see the realism. The&nbsp; prompt following it is just mind-blowing. Let's&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJxodszsERo&t=218) look at the Dall-E3. You see it is like a drawing.&nbsp; It is like a 3D render. It is not realistic&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJxodszsERo&t=226) looking. Especially when you zoom in, you will&nbsp; see that. However, Stable Diffusion 3 is able&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJxodszsERo&t=233) to generate much better realistic images. Okay,&nbsp; this is the next prompt. It is looking super real,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJxodszsERo&t=239) super good. Let's look at the Dall-E3 generation.&nbsp; And here the Dall-E3. Again, it is like a render.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJxodszsERo&t=247) And the text is not as good as the Stable&nbsp; Diffusion 3. It has a certain style. This is the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJxodszsERo&t=254) style of the Dall-E3. But with Stable Diffusion&nbsp; 3, SD 3, we will be able to get such realism. Moreover,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJxodszsERo&t=261) when they release this model to the public,&nbsp; we will be able to train it, fine-tune it,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJxodszsERo&t=266) and hopefully, I will search for the very best&nbsp; workflow for training, fine-tuning the Stable&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJxodszsERo&t=271) Diffusion 3. Okay, this is another prompt. This is&nbsp; an anime style, as you are seeing right now. It is&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJxodszsERo&t=276) looking pretty good. Let's look at the generation&nbsp; of the Dall-E3. Dall-E3 is also performing&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJxodszsERo&t=282) really good at this prompt because this is not a&nbsp; realistic prompt. This is an anime style prompt.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJxodszsERo&t=287) So Dall-E3 is also really good. Okay, let's look&nbsp; at the next one. This is a hard prompt. It has&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJxodszsERo&t=294) text, a big text. And let's see the generation&nbsp; of the Dall-E3. You see Dall-E3 is not able to&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJxodszsERo&t=301) generate text as we wish it. So Stable Diffusion&nbsp; 3 is much better than the Dall-E3 in this one as&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJxodszsERo&t=306) well. Okay, here another prompt. You see how real&nbsp; it is looking. It is like a real photograph, and&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJxodszsERo&t=312) this is super important. By the way, these images&nbsp; have lower quality because I have collected these&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJxodszsERo&t=318) images from Twitter. They were already compressed&nbsp; and also it is also compressed in this article as&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJxodszsERo&t=323) well. However, in the very bottom, I shared the&nbsp; original images. You can just download them. You&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJxodszsERo&t=328) don't need to be my Patreon supporter. The link&nbsp; will be in the description of the video. So let's&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJxodszsERo&t=333) look at the generation of the Dall-E3. Again, this&nbsp; is not looking that realistic. The ship is okay,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJxodszsERo&t=340) but you see the waves are not natural. Also,&nbsp; the composition is not accurate. However, we&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJxodszsERo&t=346) can see this is much better. So Stable Diffusion&nbsp; 3 is much better than the Dall-E3, and it will be&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJxodszsERo&t=353) public. We will be able to fine-tune it. We will&nbsp; be able to train it. It will be an amazing model,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJxodszsERo&t=359) and we will be able to locally run it. Okay,&nbsp; this is another prompt. You see it is very good&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJxodszsERo&t=364) looking. Let's see Dall-E3. Dall-E3 is again good&nbsp; at this prompt because when there is no realism,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJxodszsERo&t=370) Dall-E3 is really good. But when there is&nbsp; realism, it fails. Okay, here another and our&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJxodszsERo&t=377) final example. You see how good it is looking.&nbsp; The prompt following is amazing, mind-blowing.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJxodszsERo&t=384) And let's look at the image of the Dall-E3. It is&nbsp; like this. It failed again in this prompt. So the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJxodszsERo&t=391) absolute winner is Stable Diffusion 3. Currently,&nbsp; they are getting early testers. You see,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJxodszsERo&t=398) announcing the Stable Diffusion 3 early preview.&nbsp; Our most capable text-to-image model with greatly&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJxodszsERo&t=404) improved performance in multi-subject prompts,&nbsp; image quality, and spelling abilities. And all&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJxodszsERo&t=410) of them are looking amazing. Just check out the&nbsp; links. Maybe you can get early preview access.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJxodszsERo&t=416) Keep following me. Keep subscribing. Thank you&nbsp; so much, and see you hopefully in another amazing&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJxodszsERo&t=420) tutorial. I am working on amazing tutorials,&nbsp; and they will be soon on the channel, hopefully.
