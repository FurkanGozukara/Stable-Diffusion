Using open-source AI models and the newly released roop repository from GitHub, we can make deepfakes from a single source image. Furthermore, I have demonstrated how to use CodeFormer to significantly enhance the quality of generated video faces through the use of Automatic1111 Web UI and Davinci Resolve. I also provided a tutorial on fixing audio syncing issues. In addition, I have prepared an easy-to-use, free Google Colab that can run the roop deepfake repository and generate deepfake videos. This video is intended solely for educational and research purposes.

- [00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=42) Furthermore, I will show you how to enhance face

- [00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=45) quality with CodeFormer of the Automatic1111

- [00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=48) web UI and how to reconstruct video with DaVinci Resolve Free Edition.

- [00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=53) This video is strictly intended for educational and research purposes.

- [00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=59) Deepfake is becoming extremely easy to make, therefore everyone needs to get prepared.

- [00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=66) Furthermore, this technology will certainly change

- [00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=69) the video, movie and animation industry.

- [00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=72) So I have prepared an excellent GitHub file that will guide you through for all of the

- [00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=78) steps.

- [00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=79) The link for this file will be in the description of the video, so make sure to open this file.

- [00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=86) There are several things that you need to do before

- [00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=89) start using Deepfake on your computer.

- [00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=93) Alternatively, I also have prepared a Google Colab

- [00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=97) and you can use this repository on this

- [00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=100) Google Colab as well.

- [00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=101) I will also show you how to use it in the next chapter of the video.

- [00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=106) First we will begin with installing and using this amazing repository on our computer.

- [00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=113) First of all, you need to install Python.

- [00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=116) As a Python version, I am using 3.10.9.

- [00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=120) If you don't know how to install Python and set

- [00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=122) it as a default Python installation.

- [00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=125) Watch

- [00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=126) this amazing tutorial video.

- [00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=127) So when you open a new command prompt like this

- [00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=130) and type Python, you should get a Python

- [00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=133) version like this.

- [00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=136) I am using 3.10.9.

- [00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=137) It may work with other Python versions as well, but this is working.

- [00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=140) Then you also need to have a git.

- [00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=143) The links are here as you are seeing.

- [00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=145) When you open a cmd and type git, you should get git is available like this.

- [00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=150) Also you need to install Visual Studio redistributable package.

- [00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=153) This is the direct link and also Microsoft C++ build tools.

- [00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=156) When you open this link, you will see download build tools here, download it and install

- [00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=161) it.

- [00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=162) Once you have installed all of this.

- [00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=164) There's one more thing that you need to install, which is FFmpeg.

- [00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=168) FFmpeg is widely used.

- [00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=170) So once you set it up, it will help you tremendously in the future.

- [00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=174) Other repositories that you

- [00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=175) may use.

- [00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=176) So go to this link, download the latest build.

- [00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=180) For downloading

- [00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=181) you can download this zip file, for example.

- [00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=183) Extract it into any folder like this.

- [00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=185) I have extracted it into this folder then, then

- [00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=188) type environment and edit system environments

- [00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=192) like this: open environment variables, in here

- [00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=194) you will see path variable like this: click

- [00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=197) edit and add that as a folder like you are seeing here.

- [00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=202) Once you do this and click OK and OK, open a new

- [00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=205) cmd, type FFmpeg and you should get results

- [00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=209) like this.

- [00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=210) This means that it is correctly installed and the path of it is set.

- [00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=214) OK, after all of this, we will begin with cloning the DeepFace repository.

- [00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=218) So the link is here.

- [00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=220) Copy this command, make a new folder in any of the drive that you

- [00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=224) want to install it, I will install it in my F drive, I will type DeepFace enter inside

- [00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=230) that folder, you can also directly clone into the drive, open a new cmd, you see currently

- [00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=236) this is where I am.

- [00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=237) Right click and paste the link and it will clone into that folder.

- [00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=241) Then

- [00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=242) copy this command, paste it, you see the folder we are in is changed.

- [00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=246) We will install with

- [00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=247) making a new virtual environment so none of your other installations will be affected.

- [00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=252) For example, Stable Diffusion, it will continue working as it is.

- [00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=257) Execute the command, it

- [00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=258) will make a new virtual environment with your default Python version, then we will move

- [00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=263) into scripts folder, cd venv, cd scripts.

- [00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=267) Type activate like this and the virtual environment

- [00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=269) is activated.

- [00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=270) Whatever you install, and when you are running the application, you have to have activated

- [00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=275) this virtual environment, then type cd.. , cd.. it will go to the one of

- [00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=281) the upper parent folder, then execute this command.

- [00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=285) This will install all of the requirements.

- [00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=288) However, you may get some errors like warning retrying.

- [00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=293) These errors are caused by the connection

- [00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=295) pypi.org.

- [00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=297) This host is pretty unstable, therefore you may be needed to execute this command

- [00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=305) multiple times.

- [00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=306) Each time it will cache one of the downloaded file.

- [00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=309) So after a while, you will be able to install all of the requirements.

- [00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=313) You see even I had

- [00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=314) right now.

- [00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=315) So it re-tried to download and it was successful.

- [00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=320) The installation has been completed.

- [00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=321) Now one more step is left, we need to download this iiswapper onnx file.

- [00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=329) Just click this link, it will download the file.

- [00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=331) Once the file has been downloaded.

- [00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=333) Right click and cut it, put it into your cloned folder

- [00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=338) root directory like here, directly into roop directory.

- [00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=343) And now we are ready.

- [00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=345) There are several arguments to run this application.

- [00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=348) This is from the official repository of this project.

- [00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=352) So I prefer to run with this.

- [00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=354) So what are these doing keep frames.

- [00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=357) So when this application is running, it will extract every one of the frame of the input

- [00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=364) video, then replace the face and then it will reconstruct the video.

- [00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=369) Keep frames means that it will keep the generated frames.

- [00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=372) This can be very useful because then you may apply some face restoration, such as CodeFormer

- [00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=380) of Automatic1111.

- [00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=381) I will also show that.

- [00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=382) Keep FPS.

- [00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=383) This will keep the FPS of the

- [00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=386) video and number of cores.

- [00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=388) Now this is important.

- [00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=389) If you don't set this, it will use all of your

- [00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=392) CPU cores and it will use huge amount

- [00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=395) of RAM memory.

- [00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=396) So I suggest you to begin with like this, turn

- [00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=400) a small short clip into a deep fake video.

- [00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=404) Then if it works, you can increase the number of cores.

- [00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=408) So I will start my application with this command.

- [00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=411) For starting the application interface

- [00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=413) we need to first activate the virtual environment.

- [00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=417) So enter inside the virtual environment folder, enter inside scripts, type CMD.

- [00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=423) It will start in this directory, type activate, then cd.., cd.. and you will be

- [00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=429) in the root directory.

- [00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=431) Then copy this, for example, paste it and it will start the user interface for you.

- [00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=437) You should get a message like this.

- [00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=439) So the user interface is pretty easy to use.

- [00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=442) I will select face.

- [00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=443) As an example showcase, I will use face2 and select your target

- [00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=449) target.

- [00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=450) Means that your target video.

- [00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=451) I will use video2.

- [00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=453) So this is the selected face and this is the video it will be applied.

- [00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=457) Then click start.

- [00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=458) When you click start it will ask you which should

- [00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=460) be the output video file name.

- [00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=462) I will

- [00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=463) use face_changed2.

- [00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=464) Click Save and it will start processing.

- [00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=468) So when it starts processing, it will generate a folder with the name of your input video

- [00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=473) file video2 and video2 as you are seeing.

- [00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=476) So it will first extract every one of the

- [00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=479) frames like this.

- [00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=481) Then it will start replacing them.

- [00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=483) So this is the original frame and after

- [00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=486) a while we will see it is replaced.

- [00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=488) Patiently wait and do not touch the computer until you

- [00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=492) see video is saved as like this.

- [00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=495) So this was the original frame and this is the

- [00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=498) face swapped frame.

- [00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=500) Currently the biggest

- [00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=501) disadvantage is the resolution of the face swapping

- [00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=505) model is very low.

- [00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=506) Therefore, we can

- [00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=508) apply a face enhancer or the face has to be somewhat distant shot.

- [00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=513) So right now we are

- [00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=514) watching the side-by-side comparison of the original video and the converted video.

- [00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=521) If

- [00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=522) you encounter any problem, then you can use these video files and these images you are

- [00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=528) seeing here as a test cases.

- [00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=530) I have shared these video clips and the images on my Patreon.

- [00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=535) The link is here.

- [00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=536) If you also support me on Patreon I would appreciate that very much.

- [00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=540) Also, please join Discord and ask me any questions that you want.

- [00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=543) Please also don't forget to

- [00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=544) star our repository and watch it.

- [00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=547) Now I will show you how to use this amazing repository

- [00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=550) on Google Colab.

- [00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=551) So I made a Colab like this: click the link here, then click open in Colab.

- [00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=557) Using Colab is super easy.

- [00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=559) First, just click connect, then make sure that you have GPU.

- [00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=564) If

- [00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=565) you don't have GPU here, click change runtime and

- [00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=567) select GPU here.

- [00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=568) Click save.

- [00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=569) It may require

- [00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=571) you to reconnect.

- [00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=573) Actually, yes, it has reconnected.

- [00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=576) Once it reconnects it will delete everything

- [00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=578) and when you click here and you see GPU, disk, and system ram, that means you are ready.

- [00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=583) Then

- [00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=584) click this play icon here.

- [00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=585) Click run anyway, everything we upload here will get deleted

- [00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=590) after we terminate our session.

- [00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=592) So don't worry about privacy.

- [00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=594) It will download and install

- [00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=595) everything with just one click.

- [00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=597) You will also see an error and warning message like this.

- [00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=600) You can ignore them, it is just working and everything is installed and downloaded.

- [00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=605) Now

- [00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=606) we are ready to generate our deep fake video.

- [00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=608) So everything will be in our runtime folder.

- [00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=611) To open it click here as you are seeing.

- [00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=613) We will upload our files into this roop directory.

- [00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=618) Right click, click upload.

- [00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=619) So for this example, I will use face1 and video1.

- [00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=624) I will click

- [00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=625) upload.

- [00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=626) You see it says that ensure that your files are saved because everything will get

- [00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=630) deleted after we terminate our session.

- [00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=633) So meanwhile, when the file is getting uploaded,

- [00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=636) you will see a status like here.

- [00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=638) Okay, the upload has been completed.

- [00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=640) Now you need to change this

- [00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=642) input parameters.

- [00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=644) The face that I am going to use is face1.png.

- [00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=647) The extension is also

- [00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=649) important.

- [00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=650) Don't forget that.

- [00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=651) The input video is video1.mp4 Don't forget that and the output

- [00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=657) will be face_changed_video.

- [00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=658) You can type any name you wan.

- [00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=661) I will keep frames, keep fps and

- [00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=664) I will use gpu.

- [00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=665) Just click play icon and now we will see more system ram and gpu ram usage.

- [00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=670) First

- [00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=671) it will download the necessary model files.

- [00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=674) This is only one time.

- [00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=675) This will also happen on your

- [00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=676) computer as well, but these are all one-time downloads.

- [00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=680) Then it will extract all of the frames.

- [00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=683) So it is starting to extract frames.

- [00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=685) You see the frames are being extracted into video1 folder.

- [00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=689) You can also download this folder.

- [00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=691) For downloading you need a special code.

- [00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=693) Actually I will get that

- [00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=694) code with ChatGPT.

- [00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=696) Give me a Google Colab code to download a directory.

- [00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=702) You see I am showing you

- [00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=703) how you can also use this.

- [00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=704) Just copy code, add a code, paste it here and let's give its path.

- [00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=709) Copy

- [00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=710) path.

- [00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=711) So this is the path and it will allow us to download

- [00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=714) all of the frames like this.

- [00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=716) I will show

- [00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=717) that once this is done.

- [00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=718) So when you see swapping in progress like this, it means that it started

- [00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=723) swapping the faces so all frames were extracted.

- [00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=726) It is only using three gigabyte gpu.

- [00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=729) Once the

- [00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=730) author figures out how to use it on our computer.

- [00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=733) Even with four gigabyte vram having gpu, you can

- [00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=736) use this on your computer.

- [00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=737) Okay, the file is generated.

- [00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=740) It is in the roop folder.

- [00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=742) Face changed

- [00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=743) video, right click and download.

- [00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=744) And let's also download the repository of our frames.

- [00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=748) Here.

- [00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=749) Yes.

- [00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=750) Click play icon.

- [00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=752) It will generate a video one zip file.

- [00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=755) The zip file is generated but it failed to

- [00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=757) automatically download.

- [00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=758) Just right click and download and inside there we will see all of the

- [00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=763) frames.

- [00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=764) Of course this file is bigger.

- [00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=765) Now I will show you the face swapped video.

- [00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=771) Okay, currently we are seeing the face swapped video.

- [00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=774) The audio is also there as you are seeing.

- [00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=777) It's pretty decent quality when we consider we

- [00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=780) only use single image without any training.

- [00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=783) We can even improve the quality.

- [00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=785) How?

- [00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=786) Now I will show you that with face restoration of automatic

- [00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=790) 1111 web ui.

- [00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=791) So I will start my automatic 11 web ui from here.

- [00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=795) If you don't know how to use

- [00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=796) Automatic1111 web UI.

- [00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=798) I have amazing tutorials for this on my Stable Diffusion repository.

- [00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=804) You

- [00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=805) see I start from beginning.

- [00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=806) I show pretty much everything that you need with Automatic1111 web

- [00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=810) UI.

- [00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=811) I will also put the link of this page in the linked file so you can watch all of these

- [00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=818) videos

- [00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=819) and learn many more things about Automatic1111 web UI, including training, face training,

- [00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=825) some custom scripts like this, and many more things.

- [00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=829) Also, I did put two video links in this

- [00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=832) file which will show you how to install and use Automatic1111 web UI.

- [00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=836) It's in the bottom of the

- [00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=838) this page.

- [00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=839) So my Automatic1111 web UI is getting started.

- [00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=842) Okay, the frame zip file also downloaded.

- [00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=845) Let's move it into our directory.

- [00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=847) Let's extract it video1.zip file.

- [00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=850) So all of the frames

- [00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=852) are here.

- [00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=853) You see the face is changed.

- [00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=855) However, we can improve the face quality.

- [00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=857) So web UI started.

- [00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=859) Let's open it.

- [00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=860) How we are going to improve the face quality: go to the extras tab in here

- [00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=865) for

- [00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=866) example let's drag and drop this first frame into here and you may upscale it if you want.

- [00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=872) However, I will just show you without upscaling.

- [00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=875) This is the original resolution.

- [00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=878) So what we are

- [00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=879) going to do is select your upscaler from here.

- [00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=881) You don't need to select anything if you wish.

- [00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=883) I am

- [00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=884) going to use 4x ultra sharp and CodeFormer visibility.

- [00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=887) I will make this full like this and

- [00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=891) I will generate.

- [00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=892) So without upscaling it will only fix the face and let's compare it.

- [00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=897) This is working

- [00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=898) especially good if your face is close distance.

- [00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=901) So let's see.

- [00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=902) So this is the original frame and this

- [00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=905) is the corrected frame.

- [00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=907) You see there is a significant difference in terms of quality.

- [00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=910) Okay, let me show you as a side-by-side comparison.

- [00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=913) So here code former effect you are seeing right

- [00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=916) now.

- [00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=917) It is looking pretty amazingly better.

- [00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=921) So now I will batch process them.

- [00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=924) For batch processing

- [00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=925) go to the batch from directory, give your zip

- [00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=929) directory like this, then the output will be

- [00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=932) let's say enhanced.

- [00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=934) Okay and you see the same settings are applying.

- [00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=938) Just hit generate.

- [00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=939) It will

- [00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=940) process every one of the frames into this folder

- [00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=944) and then we will use these frames to regenerate,

- [00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=948) reconstruct our video.

- [00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=949) This may take a while depending on your computer hardware.

- [00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=953) Moreover,

- [00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=954) if you feel that the face is too much changed, you

- [00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=956) can reduce the code former visibility, and

- [00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=959) code former weights from here like 50 percent.

- [00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=962) In both cases, you can play with these values

- [00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=965) and decide how much effect should CodeFormer make

- [00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=970) on your fixed faces.

- [00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=972) Moreover, once you are

- [00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=973) done with Google Colab, click here, disconnect and

- [00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=976) delete runtime and it will delete everything

- [00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=980) and you won't have any privacy issues.

- [00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=982) The face restoration is completed.

- [00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=985) All of the frames are

- [00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=986) here.

- [00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=987) 318.

- [00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=988) However, I noticed something else.

- [00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=992) Currently when I open the output video file

- [00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=996) of the repository when I click properties I see that

- [00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=1000) the the video fps is 23.

- [00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=1003) However, when I open

- [00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=1005) the original video, the video fps is 23.976 therefore,

- [00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=1014) there is a significant issue here

- [00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=1016) which may cause audio desynchronization, so reconstructing

- [00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=1023) video from the extracted frames

- [00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=1025) looks like better way currently instead of depending the output video of the repository.

- [00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=1031) So for reconstruction of the video, I will use

- [00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=1033) Davinci Resolve free edition and I will rename

- [00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=1036) all of the frames.

- [00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=1038) To be sure just copy paste and make a backup of them, then select all of

- [00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=1042) them.

- [00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=1043) Right click rename a1.

- [00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=1045) So all frames are renamed like this.

- [00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=1047) Start a new project.

- [00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=1049) Go to the first

- [00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=1050) tab here in the three dots here.

- [00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=1053) Make the frame display mode sequence, then in the right bottom

- [00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=1057) click project settings, set the settings as you

- [00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=1060) wish.

- [00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=1061) I will set the frame rate like this.

- [00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=1063) Save

- [00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=1064) and also let's set up the our resolution like this

- [00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=1068) one.

- [00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=1069) You can set any resolution, then drag and drop

- [00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=1071) all of the frames into here.

- [00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=1074) You see now it is imported as a sequence and then drag and drop

- [00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=1078) it here and now we can see the generated video with correct fps value.

- [00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=1084) When I right click and

- [00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=1085) see the clip attributes I will see the video frame

- [00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=1088) rate which is the original one and now this

- [00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=1091) is our face restored video.

- [00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=1094) Now I will compare it with the output of the repository.

- [00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=1098) So let's also

- [00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=1100) add it into our Davinci Resolve which is here.

- [00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=1104) Drag and drop here.

- [00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=1106) Let's also append it.

- [00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=1108) You see it has

- [00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=1109) a longer duration than the reconstructed video because

- [00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=1114) of the incorrect fps value.

- [00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=1116) So let me set

- [00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=1117) its position like this so we can watch side by side.

- [00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=1121) So the left side is the face enhanced and

- [00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=1124) the right side is the original output of the repository,

- [00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=1130) deepfake repository.

- [00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=1131) Now let's also

- [00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=1132) compare it with the original footage which is here.

- [00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=1135) I will drag and drop it in here so we can compare

- [00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=1138) better.

- [00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=1139) By the way, with this way, you can also apply the correct sound so I will just unlink them.

- [00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=1146) Delete this sound and now it has the original sound.

- [00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=1150) So let's also disable this with d key on

- [00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=1154) your keyboard.

- [00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=1155) Let's put the original video to left and let's put our deep face to the right which

- [00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=1161) is

- [00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=1162) here.

- [00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=1163) Let me see.

- [00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=1164) Okay, in the left now we see our deep face and in the right we see the original

- [00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=1168) footage.

- [00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=1169) Let's watch it.

- [00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=1170) Okay, right now we are seeing on the left, our deep fake and on the

- [00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=1175) right we are seeing the original footage.

- [00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=1178) You see it is pretty amazing.

- [00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=1180) However, since we have applied

- [00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=1182) face restoration, there are some minor issues that can be visible on the high resolution,

- [00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=1189) but on the low resolution it is pretty accurate and pretty consistent and pretty high quality.

- [00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=1195) Okay, let's watch it one more time.

- [00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=1197) On the left side we are seeing the deep fake.

- [00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=1199) On the right

- [00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=1200) side we are seeing the original footage.

- [00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=1203) You can see the lips synching, the emotions and everything

- [00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=1207) looking pretty good and accurate.

- [00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=1209) And then you can export it.

- [00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=1211) I already have an amazing tutorial for

- [00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=1213) Davinci Resolve free edition as well.

- [00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=1215) You can use any software you want.

- [00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=1217) So both Automatic1111

- [00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=1218) web UI tutorials and Davinci Result tutorial are also

- [00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=1222) added to the file that you will find the link in

- [00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=1224) the description.

- [00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=1225) Then all you need to do is just export the video as you wish after you set it up.

- [00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=1230) It will also have synchronized audio of the original

- [00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=1234) video as well.

- [00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI1LEN-SgLM&t=1235) This is all for today.
