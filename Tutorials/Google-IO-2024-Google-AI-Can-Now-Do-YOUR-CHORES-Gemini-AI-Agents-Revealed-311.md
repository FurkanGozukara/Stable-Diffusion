- [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7-znNfVeg8&t=0) Ok, we continue to the Google I.O. 2024 with the part 3 right now.

- [00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7-znNfVeg8&t=7) Soon you'll be able to mix and match inputs and outputs.

- [00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7-znNfVeg8&t=10) This is what we mean when we say it's an I.O. for a new generation.

- [00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7-znNfVeg8&t=14) And I can see you all out there thinking about the possibilities.

- [00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7-znNfVeg8&t=18) But what if we could go even further?

- [00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7-znNfVeg8&t=21) That's one of the opportunities we see with AI agents.

- [00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7-znNfVeg8&t=24) Let me take a step back and explain what I mean by that.

- [00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7-znNfVeg8&t=28) I think about them as intelligent systems that show reasoning, planning and memory.

- [00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7-znNfVeg8&t=33) Are able to think multiple steps ahead.

- [00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7-znNfVeg8&t=36) Work across software and systems.

- [00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7-znNfVeg8&t=39) All to get something done on your behalf.

- [00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7-znNfVeg8&t=42) And most importantly, under your supervision.

- [00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7-znNfVeg8&t=45) We are still in the early days.

- [00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7-znNfVeg8&t=48) And you'll see glimpses of our approach throughout the day.

- [00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7-znNfVeg8&t=51) But let me show you the kinds of use cases we are working hard to solve.

- [00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7-znNfVeg8&t=56) Let's start with shopping.

- [00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7-znNfVeg8&t=58) It's pretty fun to shop for shoes.

- [00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7-znNfVeg8&t=61) And a lot less fun to return them when they don't fit.

- [00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7-znNfVeg8&t=65) Imagine if Gemini could do all the steps for you.

- [00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7-znNfVeg8&t=68) Searching your inbox for the receipt.

- [00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7-znNfVeg8&t=71) Locating the order number from your email.

- [00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7-znNfVeg8&t=74) Filling out a return form.

- [00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7-znNfVeg8&t=76) And even scheduling a pickup.

- [00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7-znNfVeg8&t=78) That's much easier, right?

- [00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7-znNfVeg8&t=80) Let's take another example that's a bit more complex.

- [00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7-znNfVeg8&t=88) Say you just moved to Chicago.

- [00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7-znNfVeg8&t=90) You can imagine Gemini and Chrome working together.

- [00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7-znNfVeg8&t=94) To help you do a number of things to get ready.

- [00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7-znNfVeg8&t=97) Organizing, reasoning, synthesizing on your behalf.

- [00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7-znNfVeg8&t=101) For example, you will want to explore the city and find services nearby.

- [00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7-znNfVeg8&t=105) From dry cleaners to dog walkers.

- [00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7-znNfVeg8&t=108) You'll have to update your new address across dozens of websites.

- [00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7-znNfVeg8&t=112) Gemini can work across these tasks.

- [00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7-znNfVeg8&t=115) And will prompt you for more information when needed.

- [00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7-znNfVeg8&t=118) So you're always in control.

- [00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7-znNfVeg8&t=120) That part is really important as we prototype these experiences.

- [00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7-znNfVeg8&t=124) We are thinking hard about how to do it in a way that's private, secure.

- [00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7-znNfVeg8&t=129) And works for everyone.

- [00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7-znNfVeg8&t=131) These are simple use cases.

- [00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7-znNfVeg8&t=133) But they give you a good sense of the types of problems we want to solve.

- [00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7-znNfVeg8&t=137) By building intelligent systems that think ahead, reason and plan.

- [00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7-znNfVeg8&t=142) All on your behalf.

- [00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7-znNfVeg8&t=144) The power of Gemini with multi-modality, long context and agents.

- [00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7-znNfVeg8&t=150) Brings us closer to our ultimate goal.

- [00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7-znNfVeg8&t=153) Making AI helpful for everyone.

- [00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7-znNfVeg8&t=156) We see this as how we will make the most progress against our mission.

- [00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7-znNfVeg8&t=160) Organizing the world's information across every input.

- [00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7-znNfVeg8&t=164) Making it accessible via any output.

- [00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7-znNfVeg8&t=167) And combining the world's information with the information in your world.

- [00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7-znNfVeg8&t=171) In a way that's truly useful for you.
