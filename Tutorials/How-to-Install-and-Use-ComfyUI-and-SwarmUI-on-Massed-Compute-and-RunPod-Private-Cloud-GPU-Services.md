### Video Transcription


- [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=0) Greetings everyone. Today I am going to show&nbsp; you how to install SwarmUI and ComfyUI on&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=6) Massed Compute and RunPod and use all the&nbsp; presets we have, generate amazing images&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=12) or videos. If you remember, I had shown how to&nbsp; generate ultra-realistic images with SwarmUI by&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=20) using the Wan 2.2. We had published the&nbsp; tutorial for Windows like two days ago,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=26) so please watch this tutorial to learn how to use&nbsp; it in details. Today I will show how to install&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=33) and use it on Massed Compute and RunPod,&nbsp; but it won't be as detailed as this one.

- [00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=39) So first of all, let's download the ComfyUI&nbsp; installer. It is version 57 right now. You see&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=45) the latest zip file is here. Also, I recommend&nbsp; you to scroll down and read the news. You see,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=52) I have compiled a new stage attention and it&nbsp; has fixed black outputs on RTX 3000 series.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=60) Maybe more of the black outputs are fixed, I&nbsp; don't know yet, but this is an improvement.

- [00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=66) Then download the SwarmUI installer. It&nbsp; is version 89 right now. We are updating,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=73) adding more features. You can read all&nbsp; the news by scrolling down and see the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=79) changelogs. Then move the zip files into any&nbsp; folder. So I moved them here. First of all,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=85) I will extract the ComfyUI.&nbsp; Extract all, like this.

- [00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=90) Then enter inside the folder and you will see that&nbsp; there is Massed Compute instructions .txt file.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=95) Double click it. We have some links and tutorials&nbsp; here if you want to watch them later. Please use&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=100) this link to register. After registration, go to&nbsp; billing, set up some balance, then go to deploy.

- [00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=108) In here, select your GPU. RTX Pro 6000 Blackwall&nbsp; GPU is the best, but L40S is also really good.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=116) Let me show you their prices. So select creator,&nbsp; select the SECourses, apply direct coupon like&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=123) SECourses, verify. So RTX Pro 6000, 96 gigabyte&nbsp; GPU is 1.47 dollars per hour. Let's see the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=132) L40S. Currently there is no L40S available, so&nbsp; I will use this one. Or there is only one GPU,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=139) so let's select another one. For example,&nbsp; let's get H100. Okay, it is also a single&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=145) GPU left. So let's get this one. This is also&nbsp; a fast one. Okay, it is also single. Wow. Okay,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=150) this one has two GPUs. Why I am choosing&nbsp; two GPUs? So I can show you how to utilize&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=155) both of the GPUs at the same time. Okay, click&nbsp; verify. You see 1.80 dollars for 2x A100. Deploy.

- [00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=163) So this is important, we have selected image&nbsp; SECourses. Okay, now we need to wait for our&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=169) machine to initialize. Meanwhile, if you have&nbsp; not previously installed ThinLinc client,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=175) go to ThinLinc client. You see from&nbsp; details, select the Windows installer,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=180) or if you are using Mac or Linux select&nbsp; them. Open the installer, it will ask you,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=185) click yes. Click next, accept, next, install.&nbsp; That's all default. Run ThinLinc client.

- [00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=192) Important thing here is click&nbsp; options, go to local devices,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=196) select clipboard synchronization and drives.&nbsp; Then click details. Then we are going to add&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=201) a folder. So select your folder from your&nbsp; PC, any folder you wish. This is my folder,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=207) let me show you. You see, this is my folder.&nbsp; Then make the permission read and write to not&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=213) have any issues. Okay. Then okay. Okay,&nbsp; now we just wait for initialization.

- [00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=219) Okay, the initialization of the machine has&nbsp; been completed. We are updating our image to&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=225) become available faster. So hopefully the machine&nbsp; initialization will become much faster. Then copy&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=232) this login URL and copy your password and copy&nbsp; your username. This is how we connect to our&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=239) machine. Click connect, continue. Wait for screen&nbsp; to start. Yes, it is starting. Then click start.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=246) So this will connect to the remote machine, the&nbsp; Massed Compute desktop interface. This is running&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=253) on remote. I will copy my files into shared&nbsp; folder. You see ComfyUI and Swarm Downloader,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=261) I will copy them. This is my shared&nbsp; folder. I will paste them here.

- [00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=266) Then inside the ThinLinc client, it may take&nbsp; a while to load depending on your location,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=272) your internet connection. Currently it is slow&nbsp; at me. Go to home, then scroll down and go to&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=278) ThinDrives. This is your shared folder with&nbsp; your computer. Whatever you put inside here,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=285) whether on your PC or in Massed Compute, it&nbsp; will be synchronized. So you can download&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=290) your generated images and videos from here as&nbsp; well. So ComfyUI version 57 and SwarmUI model&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=297) downloader. Copy both of them or you can drag&nbsp; and drop into downloads. Or right click here&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=302) and paste. So you can use either drag and drop&nbsp; or copy and paste. Wait for synchronization to&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=308) be completed. You see, it shows that there is&nbsp; a synchronization here, copying files. You need&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=313) to wait this. Do not run anything inside&nbsp; shared folder, always copy into downloads.

- [00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=318) So the ComfyUI has been copied. Right click and&nbsp; extract here. I will first install the ComfyUI.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=324) You see there is Massed Compute instructions,&nbsp; double click it. Then select this install command,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=329) right click, copy. Go back to folder, click&nbsp; this three dots icon. All of my installations&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=336) are same. Open in terminal. All of my applications&nbsp; installed same way. Right click and paste and hit&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=343) enter. This will start the ComfyUI installation.&nbsp; Now just wait it to be completed. This should be&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=348) fairly fast on Massed Compute. We are also&nbsp; working update of the image. As I said,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=354) we will have the latest ComfyUI, latest SwarmUI&nbsp; and latest of everything. So the installations&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=359) will get faster, but it is already really&nbsp; fast. When you see the software updater,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=364) just click cancel. You don't need to install&nbsp; anything. Just click cancel and follow the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=369) CMD terminal from here. You see when&nbsp; I click it, it will show the terminal.

- [00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=373) Okay, so the ComfyUI installation has been&nbsp; completed. Now we can move to the next&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=377) step, SwarmUI installation. However, it is not&nbsp; needed in our machine. So the ComfyUI installation&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=385) has been completed. Now it is time for SwarmUI,&nbsp; but SwarmUI has been installed already. So control&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=391) alt D, it will minimize everything. Then you&nbsp; see there is run SwarmUI update. Double click&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=398) this. This will update the SwarmUI to the latest&nbsp; version and start it. Just wait for it to start&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=404) at the beginning. So it is doing the update.&nbsp; It is started. Now you can close this. Okay,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=409) it is already opened. I will just close it. I&nbsp; will first download models, then I will start&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=414) again. I will show you in a moment. So go back&nbsp; to downloads. Right click and extract the model&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=420) downloader. Enter inside the model downloader&nbsp; folder. You will see that Massed Compute model&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=426) download instructions .txt file. Copy this,&nbsp; right click and copy. Go back to your folder,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=431) click this three dots, open in terminal and&nbsp; paste it. This will start model downloader&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=437) because we need to download models. If you put&nbsp; the models inside the Massed Compute image,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=443) it takes too long to start. Therefore, we are&nbsp; removing all the models, but we will keep the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=449) SwarmUI installed and few other applications&nbsp; installed. So the ComfyUI installation or update&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=454) will be faster. SwarmUI is already installed, as&nbsp; you have seen, it was just immediately updated.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=461) But we are working on to make this machine start&nbsp; faster and more lightweight. So the application&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=468) is starting. In a moment, yes, started.&nbsp; It will be automatically opened like this.

- [00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=473) So I am going to download SwarmUI bundles and&nbsp; image bundle. Let's see the download speed. It&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=479) should be blazing fast. Okay, 200 megabytes per&nbsp; second. Okay, around 300 megabytes per second,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=487) very decent. You can download any model&nbsp; as well or all the bundles from here.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=493) You can type the name like one, it will list&nbsp; you, or you can use URL downloader to download&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=498) from Civitai or anywhere you want. But it is&nbsp; downloading right now. If you want to learn more,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=504) please watch this tutorial because I have&nbsp; explained it in this base Windows tutorial.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=509) I am not going to repeat everything here again.&nbsp; So let's just wait for downloads to be completed.

- [00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=515) Okay, once the model downloads have been&nbsp; completed, let's return back to desktop.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=520) Control alt D, it will minimize everything.&nbsp; Then I am going to start the SwarmUI with&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=526) this one. You see run Cloudflare SwarmUI. Okay,&nbsp; let's just run it. It will start SwarmUI with a&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=533) Cloudflare link. Okay, it is started. You see&nbsp; here, open link. And copy this link like this&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=539) and open it in your browser so that it will&nbsp; work really fast. It will be running on the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=546) Massed Compute machine, but I will be able&nbsp; to use it from my computer. So first of all,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=551) we will add new backends. You see it is using&nbsp; our existing backend. We will update it later,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=557) but using the installed ComfyUI is the best. So&nbsp; it is here inside ComfyUI. So click control L,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=565) select it like this, control C, and paste it&nbsp; here. So click this edit icon, paste here,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=571) and type main.py like this. Let me zoom out.&nbsp; Okay, I cannot zoom out. Maybe from here,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=577) yes. You see this is the path wherever I have&nbsp; installed, it is ComfyUI installation and at&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=583) the end main.py. I am also going to add some extra&nbsp; arguments, --use-sage-attention. If you get black&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=592) outputs with your used model or preset, you can&nbsp; remove this. And I will make the OverQueue 0.

- [00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=599) So this is for the first GPU. You can see&nbsp; that how many GPUs you have. We have two&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=604) GPUs right now. So let's go back to backends&nbsp; and add another Comfy self-starting. Copy this&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=610) path again and paste here. Copy the extra&nbsp; arguments. Make the GPU ID 1, make the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=616) OverQueue 0 and save. So now when I generate&nbsp; multiple images or videos at the same time,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=621) it will be distributed on each GPU. Go back to&nbsp; generate. Go to models and refresh. Yes, all the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=628) models are here. Go to presets. We don't have&nbsp; the presets yet. However, we have preset here,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=633) so I will right click and extract this into my&nbsp; own folder. So enter inside the folder and then&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=641) import preset, choose file. Go back wherever you&nbsp; have extracted it, select the preset and overwrite&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=650) existing ones if you want to overwrite, import.&nbsp; It is imported. Click refresh, sort by name.

- [00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=657) So the rest is exactly same as in Windows&nbsp; tutorial, but I will make a demo for you and let's&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=664) also see the speed. First, we have to wait for&nbsp; backends to be loaded. When we go to the logs and&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=669) debug, we will see that it is loading. We should&nbsp; just wait. If it doesn't load for a long time,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=675) you can just terminate all the terminals, quit&nbsp; all three terminals, then run the Cloudflare&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=681) stable SwarmUI again. It should fix the issue,&nbsp; most likely case. So let's see. Sometimes it may&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=689) take a while for Cloudflare URL to start. Yes,&nbsp; it is taking some time. You can also use from&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=696) the local URL it has from here. You see local&nbsp; URL. Let's go to logs. Okay. Do we have any&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=703) issues anywhere? Yeah, the backends loaded. Now&nbsp; we need to wait for Cloudflare. For some reason,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=710) it didn't start. So if it doesn't start, you can&nbsp; restart again. Yeah, the Cloudflare didn't start,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=716) so I will restart again. This can happen,&nbsp; unfortunately, so you need to try. Okay,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=721) it gave us a new link. Okay, this one&nbsp; started. So let's open this in our browser.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=727) Now the backend will load much quicker.&nbsp; Sometimes it gets stuck, so just restart.

- [00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=733) Yes, it is started very quickly. Presets are here.&nbsp; As I said, the rest is exactly as in the Windows&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=739) tutorial. So let's make a demo. Quick tools, reset&nbsp; params, and realistic images. Cinematic image of a&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=749) fast car. Then you can choose your aspect ratio or&nbsp; resolution and generate. So the first generation&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=756) will be done on the first model. Generate again.&nbsp; The second one will be in the second model. Let's&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=761) generate 10 images. So it will generate 10 images.&nbsp; The generations will happen on both of the GPUs.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=768) First of all, it is loading both of the GPUs.&nbsp; So let's go to logs to see. After load has been&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=774) completed, it will be much faster. Okay, the first&nbsp; generation started. Now let's just see them here.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=782) Yes, you see both of the GPUs are generating&nbsp; images at the same time. So this way you can scale&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=788) your generation speed. You can rent as many as&nbsp; GPUs having machines, like eight GPUs. You can add&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=795) eight backends and generate eight images at the&nbsp; same time. Modern GPUs are much faster, like RTX&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=802) 6000 Pro or RTX 4090, but A100 will be also fast.&nbsp; You see like 3 second IT. And we got the images.

- [00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=812) So you can from more download, download them to&nbsp; your computer, or you can go to your ThinLinc&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=818) client, go to home, go to apps, go to stable&nbsp; SwarmUI. This is where it is installed. Go to&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=824) output and go to local. So these are where the&nbsp; images will be generated. So you can copy this&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=831) local, go to your ThinDrives, enter inside your&nbsp; shared folder, paste it. So once this is pasted&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=839) here, when you go back to your shared drive&nbsp; on your PC, you will see the generated images&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=845) are also copied here like this. This is another&nbsp; way of copying, mass copying. Either way works.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=852) So once you are done with your generations,&nbsp; you need to turn off your machine. The other&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=856) presets are same. You can just quick tools,&nbsp; reset params to default and select them,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=861) but you need to download their models. And&nbsp; downloading their models are easy. From the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=866) model downloader, we have bundles for everything.&nbsp; So delete the research if you have and check out&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=871) the bundles. Image generation bundle, Qwen image&nbsp; core bundle, Wan 2.2 core bundle, Wan 2.1 core&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=878) bundle, so flux models core bundle. You can&nbsp; download them and use other presets as well.

- [00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=884) And now I will turn off my machine to not spend&nbsp; any time. So click delete and delete. Once you&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=891) delete, it will be all gone. If you stop it,&nbsp; it will not stop your billing. So you need to&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=896) delete this. And it is deleted. That's it. Now&nbsp; I will start the RunPod part, so you can also&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=902) watch that part to learn how to use on RunPod&nbsp; as well. Thank you so much. Let's continue.

- [00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=907) Open the RunPod instructions .txt file. You can&nbsp; watch the links here. You can read it. I recommend&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=913) that. Please register the RunPod from here. After&nbsp; registration, sign in if it doesn't automatically&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=919) sign in you. Then go to billing and add some&nbsp; credits to your account. Then go to pods. Then&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=926) you see there is options here. Click this deploy.&nbsp; I recommend to use secure cloud and in here,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=934) I recommend to click additional filters and NVMe&nbsp; disk and make this 100 gigabytes to get a decent&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=942) pod. Most of the times the pods of the RunPod can&nbsp; be broken. I will show with 2x RTX 4090. Select&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=950) 2x, so I can show you multiple backends and how&nbsp; to generate multiple images or videos at the same&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=956) time. Now this is confusing so many people. We&nbsp; are not going to use this template. Why? Because&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=963) in the RunPod instructions .txt file, it tells you&nbsp; to use this template. So always follow the RunPod&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=969) instructions .txt files for my applications. So&nbsp; click change template, select PyTorch 2.2. Okay,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=977) 2 GPUs edit because we are going to increase the&nbsp; volume disk size to like minimum 200 gigabytes.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=984) If you are going to download more models, you&nbsp; need more and set overrides. Then click deploy on&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=988) demand. Just wait pod to be ready. This should be&nbsp; fairly fast because we are using official PyTorch&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=995) 2.2 template. Yes. It takes few seconds. Then&nbsp; click Jupyter Lab. Okay, it is not ready yet,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=1001) so you need to try again and again until it&nbsp; becomes ready. If it doesn't become ready&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=1006) like in one or two minutes, delete the pod and&nbsp; get a new one. Unfortunately, because RunPod is&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=1011) extremely unpredictable. Okay, it didn't start.&nbsp; I am trying again. Yes, it still didn't start.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=1018) Try again. Okay, it doesn't start, so I will get&nbsp; a new pod meanwhile to increase my chances. Okay,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=1025) filters are remaining. Let's make this 2x, change&nbsp; template, 2.2 edit, 200 gigabytes, set overrides,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=1034) and deploy on demand. So whichever starts first,&nbsp; I will delete the other one. Okay, try again. No,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=1041) I cannot access yet. In these machines, I am doing&nbsp; Qwen image full fine tuning. I am researching it&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=1049) right now. Okay, this one also failed. So I&nbsp; don't need this one at the moment. The test&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=1054) has been completed. So stop pod and terminate. I&nbsp; don't need it. So I am deleting everything. Okay,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=1062) one more time I am going to test. So the&nbsp; Jupyter Lab and the Jupyter Lab. I hope&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=1068) one of them starts. Yes, this one started. So&nbsp; you see this is this one and this one didn't&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=1074) start. So I am going to delete that one, which is&nbsp; this one. So stop the pod and terminate the pod.

- [00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=1081) Then I am going to upload files. First of&nbsp; all, I am going to install the ComfyUI. So&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=1087) upload the ComfyUI zip file into here and let's&nbsp; refresh. Okay, extract archive. By the way, you&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=1096) need to wait for upload to be completed. It is not&nbsp; completed yet. So the extract would not work. Yes,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=1102) it didn't work. Okay, it is completed. Now right&nbsp; click and extract archive. Refresh. Yes. Then open&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=1110) RunPod instructions .txt file. Select this install&nbsp; command, terminal, copy paste and that's it. You&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=1117) are ready. You just need to wait for installation&nbsp; to be completed right now for ComfyUI.

- [00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=1124) The installation speed on RunPod 100 percentage&nbsp; depends on the pod you got. Sometimes it can take&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=1130) one hour, sometimes it can take five minutes.&nbsp; Extremely undependable and unpredictable. On&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=1138) Massed Compute, it is always fast, but on RunPod,&nbsp; it is up to your chances. Moreover, if you use the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=1144) permanent storage, it is way slower than getting a&nbsp; new pod as I did. But permanent storage advantage&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=1151) is that you can start multiple machines on the&nbsp; same storage and it is always kept as it is.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=1158) This machine looks like a decent speed. It started&nbsp; installation sooner than I expect, but let's see.

- [00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=1164) Okay, so the ComfyUI installation has been&nbsp; completed. Now we will install SwarmUI.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=1170) Upload the SwarmUI zip file into your workspace.&nbsp; Wait for upload to be completed. It is uploading&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=1176) right now. And what if if you want to just use the&nbsp; ComfyUI? You can use it. We have the instructions&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=1183) all here. So the upload has been completed. You&nbsp; see SwarmUI model downloader, extract archive.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=1190) Then it will extract like this. Find the RunPod&nbsp; SwarmUI install instructions. Then copy this&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=1197) entire string like this and open a new terminal.&nbsp; If you get this, just ignore. Ignore. This is due&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=1204) to internet connection. Okay, now it's fixed. And&nbsp; hit enter. Now we will install SwarmUI instantly.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=1212) You will see that because we have installed the&nbsp; ComfyUI. Okay, just wait. It will give us a secure&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=1220) Cloudflare link to connect SwarmUI. You can also&nbsp; use the RunPod proxy, but I don't recommend it&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=1227) because it is very problematic and slow. Okay, we&nbsp; are still waiting. Yes. Now the SwarmUI started&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=1234) and we got the Cloudflare URL here. Let me zoom in&nbsp; to show you. So this is the Cloudflare URL. Click&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=1243) it and the SwarmUI interface will start like this.&nbsp; Agree, customize, important. You can choose any,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=1250) next. This one, next. This is none. We don't&nbsp; install ComfyUI local. Important, don't forget,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=1257) none, next. I don't want to download anything.&nbsp; Next, and yes, I am sure, and ready. You see?

- [00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=1264) Now we are going to add two backends because we&nbsp; have two GPUs. Click the ComfyUI self-starting.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=1270) Okay. It shows double, but it is actually one.&nbsp; Let's just refresh. Go to server backends,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=1275) yes. And add another one. And that's&nbsp; it. Now our ComfyUI is installed here.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=1282) Enter inside it. You will see that there is&nbsp; main.py. Right click and copy path. These&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=1288) errors are not important, they will get&nbsp; fixed. Click this icon, copy paste it here,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=1293) but put a backslash to the beginning because&nbsp; all RunPod paths start with this backslash.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=1300) I'm going to use Sage Attention. If you&nbsp; get black output, remove this, but you&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=1305) shouldn't. Then make this OverQueue 0 and save.&nbsp; We will do the same in the here. So copy paste,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=1313) copy paste. Make this GPU ID 1 and make this 0&nbsp; and save. Now wait for backends to start. It is&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=1320) starting. It should be fairly fast. Meanwhile&nbsp; waiting this to make it ready, you see we have&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=1327) no models yet. So we are going to use the SwarmUI&nbsp; downloader inside workspace. Find the RunPod model&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=1334) download instructions .txt file, open it, copy&nbsp; this part, copy, control C, open a new terminal,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=1342) paste it and hit enter. This will start the&nbsp; model downloader where you can download our&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=1347) bundles, any single model, anything. I have&nbsp; explained everything in this tutorial video,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=1353) so watch it. I am not going to show everything&nbsp; again. That tutorial is mandatory. And click&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=1358) this link and you will get the model downloader&nbsp; interface. It will automatically recognize our&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=1364) model folder. Let's go to SwarmUI bundles and&nbsp; download the image generation models. But you&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=1371) can download any bundle or any single model.&nbsp; Everything is possible. You can just search,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=1377) it will list you all the models. You can use&nbsp; the URL downloader, everything is fine. Let's&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=1381) see the download speed. Yes, really good, like&nbsp; 600 megabytes per second. This is amazing speed&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=1388) and our SwarmUI is still loading the backends. You&nbsp; can go to logs, debug and see what is happening,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=1394) but it should become available very soon. If this&nbsp; doesn't start for any reason, just stop your pod,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=1402) start again or restart and run the commands again,&nbsp; it should work. But I think it will work right&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=1407) away. It is just downloading few models. And our&nbsp; models are getting downloaded. My downloader is&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=1413) doing hash check. It is extremely robust. So when&nbsp; you watch this tutorial, you will see everything.

- [00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=1418) Okay, so the model downloads have been completed.&nbsp; Let's go back to our SwarmUI. Let's click refresh.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=1425) The models should appear. Yes, models appeared,&nbsp; as you can see. Then let's go to presets.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=1431) Currently we don't have any presets, so&nbsp; we need to import them. Import presets,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=1436) choose file. In your extracted folder, right click&nbsp; the Swarm model downloader and let's extract it.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=1444) I'm using the WinRAR, you can use anything.&nbsp; Extract files. Okay. Yes to all. Enter inside&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=1450) the extracted folder and select the amazing Swarm&nbsp; preset latest version. You can click overwrite and&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=1456) import and it will import all of our presets.&nbsp; Then click refresh and sort by name and ready.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=1464) So the rest is exactly as in the Windows tutorial&nbsp; part, but let's make a demo. So I will select the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=1471) Wan 2.2 generate realistic images. So reset&nbsp; params to default and direct apply. Photo of&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=1477) a an old wise man. Let's generate 10 images&nbsp; so we can see the speed of both GPUs. First&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=1484) it will load models to the GPU. This takes time&nbsp; on RunPod, so we need to wait. You can watch the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=1492) logs and what is happening. Moreover, it is&nbsp; still waiting for connecting to the server.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=1499) RunPod is always very slow compared to Massed&nbsp; Compute. Okay, we are still waiting. Yeah,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=1505) we are waiting. Let's click generate again. It&nbsp; should see our command on the logs, but I still&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=1512) don't see. Let's copy this. Okay, it started. You&nbsp; see? 20 current generations because we clicked&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=1519) double times the generate, but it is slow.&nbsp; You just need to wait. Now in the debug, yes,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=1525) now it's starting to load models. Always patiently&nbsp; wait, it gets faster once the models loaded.

- [00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=1533) Okay, so the generations started. We can see the&nbsp; previews. For example, this is the image. The rest&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=1540) is exactly as in the Windows tutorial part. You&nbsp; can of course always apply the image upscale which&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=1547) improves the quality significantly. To download&nbsp; these images, you can click more and download or&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=1552) go back to your workspace inside SwarmUI, inside&nbsp; output. You can download from here. Right click&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=1559) and download as an archive. It will download all&nbsp; the generated images and videos. If you want to&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=1565) use these presets, you just need to download their&nbsp; models. In our model downloader, we have bundles.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=1570) You see Swarm bundles, image generation bundle,&nbsp; Qwen image core bundle, Wan 2.2 core bundle. For&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=1576) generating videos, I recommend this. Wan 2.1 core&nbsp; bundle, flux models core bundle. Once you download&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=1582) those bundles, these presets will become available&nbsp; to use to you. And that's it. I hope you have&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=1588) enjoyed. Don't forget to turn off your machine&nbsp; once you are done. It's inside pods. So here the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=1597) machine, I can turn it off from stop pod and I&nbsp; can start again. This is one of the advantage of&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=1603) RunPod. All the data will remain. After starting&nbsp; again, I just need to start the SwarmUI same as I&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=1610) have installed. It will be instant and all will&nbsp; be ready. However, you see this machine will&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=1615) use 6 cents per hour until I terminate it. When I&nbsp; click the terminate pod, it will be gone forever.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=1624) For example, this pod is running on my storage&nbsp; from here. So in this pod, there is no stop pod.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=1630) I can terminate it, but all the data will remain&nbsp; in my storage. It's exactly same logic. You just&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBxgtVD3ek4&t=1636) make a new network volume and the rest is same.&nbsp; So hopefully see you later. Thank you so much.
