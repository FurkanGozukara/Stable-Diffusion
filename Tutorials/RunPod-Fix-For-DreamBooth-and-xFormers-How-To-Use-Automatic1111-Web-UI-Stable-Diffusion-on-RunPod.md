Emergence of Innovative AI Technologies: RunPod, Stable Diffusion, Xformers, DreamBooth, Textual Inversion, DALL-E, Midjourney, and PyTorch

Introduction

Artificial intelligence (AI) has rapidly evolved over the last few years, giving rise to a plethora of novel technologies and applications. In this article, we will delve into eight groundbreaking AI advancements: RunPod, Stable Diffusion, Xformers, DreamBooth, Textual Inversion, DALL-E, Midjourney, and PyTorch. Each of these technologies showcases the versatility and power of AI, shaping the future of various industries.

RunPod

RunPod is an AI-powered platform that optimizes the execution of machine learning (ML) models. It streamlines the deployment and management of ML workflows, reducing complexity and accelerating the development process. RunPod achieves this by automatically selecting the most suitable computational resources, minimizing latency, and ensuring optimal performance. Consequently, RunPod enables organizations to implement efficient ML systems and focus on their core business objectives.

Stable Diffusion

Stable Diffusion is a novel technique for training generative models in AI. It enhances the stability and convergence of training processes, yielding more accurate and realistic output. This approach is particularly beneficial for image and video synthesis tasks, where traditional methods may struggle with high-dimensional data. Stable Diffusion improves upon the existing diffusion models by introducing new optimization techniques, resulting in faster training times and improved sample quality. As a result, Stable Diffusion has the potential to revolutionize computer vision and graphics applications.

Xformers

Xformers is a new family of transformer-based AI models designed to handle large-scale data more efficiently. These models address the limitations of traditional transformers, such as high computational complexity and memory requirements. Xformers leverage novel techniques like sparse attention, adaptive computation, and efficient matrix operations to reduce resource consumption without sacrificing performance. This enables the deployment of advanced AI models on resource-constrained devices, opening the door for real-time applications in areas such as natural language processing, computer vision, and speech recognition.

DreamBooth

### Video Transcription


- [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA4LksIVas8&t=0) Greetings everyone, there have been so many&nbsp; Automatic1111 Web UI and DreamBooth Extension&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA4LksIVas8&t=4) updates. Therefore, in this video, I will show&nbsp; you how you can use the latest Automatic1111&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA4LksIVas8&t=9) Web UI and DreamBooth Extension with the latest&nbsp; xFormers on a RunPod. For DreamBooth training,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA4LksIVas8&t=16) I am suggesting you to get at least 20GB VRAM&nbsp; and 30GB RAM memory. So click Deploy. From here,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA4LksIVas8&t=22) select your template as Stable Diffusion 1.5&nbsp; version. Make the temporary disk as 10GB because&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA4LksIVas8&t=29) we are going to do some installation. Make the&nbsp; persistent volume as you wish and deploy. This&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA4LksIVas8&t=34) will be a short video. Therefore, if you want to&nbsp; learn more about RunPod and how to use it with&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA4LksIVas8&t=40) Stable Diffusion and Automatic1111 Web UI, I have&nbsp; an excellent tutorial. It is very long and it is&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA4LksIVas8&t=46) very comprehensive. Watching this tutorial will&nbsp; help you significantly. Okay, after creating our&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA4LksIVas8&t=51) Pod, let's go to the My Pods. In here, it will&nbsp; be get initialized. Once the initialization is&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA4LksIVas8&t=57) completed, we will see connect button here. Okay,&nbsp; connect button appeared. Let's connect. Connect&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA4LksIVas8&t=62) to JupyterLab. Okay, let's begin with updating our&nbsp; Stable Diffusion Web UI. Enter inside your Stable&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA4LksIVas8&t=68) Diffusion Web UI folder. Click Terminal. Your&nbsp; terminal will start in this folder. Then type git&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA4LksIVas8&t=74) pull. This will update it to latest version. Then&nbsp; we are going to update relauncher.py. Double click&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA4LksIVas8&t=80) it. It will be opened like this. It is constantly&nbsp; trying to relaunch. Therefore, we will change the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA4LksIVas8&t=85) behavior. (n &lt; 1). Click save with ctrl s. It&nbsp; is saved. Then we will install the DreamBooth&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA4LksIVas8&t=92) extension manually. To do that, copy the URL of&nbsp; the extension from this gist file. I will put this&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA4LksIVas8&t=100) gist file link in the description. This is really&nbsp; important one. Copy. Then inside this extensions&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA4LksIVas8&t=106) folder, click plus icon. Click Terminal. The&nbsp; terminal will be opened inside this folder.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA4LksIVas8&t=112) Therefore, just type git clone. Paste the URL. The&nbsp; extension has been cloned here. The very important&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA4LksIVas8&t=119) thing is that in the Unix environment, there is&nbsp; a problem. The problem is that the requirements&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA4LksIVas8&t=127) versions. There is a requirements conflicting&nbsp; happening. Therefore, enter inside your DreamBooth&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA4LksIVas8&t=133) extension folder. You will see requirements.txt&nbsp; file. Open it. When you double click it, it will&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA4LksIVas8&t=138) be opened. Then go back to your Stable Diffusion&nbsp; Web UI. In here, you will see requirements&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA4LksIVas8&t=143) versions.txt file. So you need to check each one&nbsp; of them and fix the conflictions. For example,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA4LksIVas8&t=150) the Accelerate version of the DreamBooth extension&nbsp; is 0.17.1. And the Accelerate version of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA4LksIVas8&t=157) Stable Diffusion Web UI is 0.12. Therefore,&nbsp; we will override it with the version of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA4LksIVas8&t=163) DreamBooth extension. There is also transformers.&nbsp; So I will copy paste the transformers version as&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA4LksIVas8&t=168) well like this. And there is also one more. This&nbsp; is GitPython. I am also copy pasting it. Why we&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA4LksIVas8&t=174) are doing this? Because when you are launching&nbsp; your Web UI, it will override back to the lower&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA4LksIVas8&t=179) version and it will cause the DreamBooth&nbsp; extension not work. Once you have done this,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA4LksIVas8&t=184) we will make two installation. Which is the&nbsp; correct Torch and CUDA version and the xFormers&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA4LksIVas8&t=191) version. Both of them are posted on our Gist file.&nbsp; The first one we are going to install is this one.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA4LksIVas8&t=198) Torch version. So click plus icon, open terminal.&nbsp; You can open this terminal inside your workspace.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA4LksIVas8&t=204) It will work because by default it is using the&nbsp; venv folder, virtual environment folder of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA4LksIVas8&t=210) Stable Diffusion Web UI installation. And you&nbsp; see it is already installed by default. Then the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA4LksIVas8&t=215) second command we are going to run is installing&nbsp; this specific xFormers. For finding this,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA4LksIVas8&t=222) I have spent a lot of time. Actually, I have spent&nbsp; over six hours to figure out the correctly working&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA4LksIVas8&t=227) xFormers version because they have removed the&nbsp; other xFormers wheels from the repository. So&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA4LksIVas8&t=234) first we will uninstall the xFormers version&nbsp; with pip uninstall xFormers. It will uninstall&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA4LksIVas8&t=240) the xFormers. It will ask you to continue.&nbsp; Click proceed. Yes, and it is uninstalled.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA4LksIVas8&t=245) Then copy paste the command I posted on the Gist&nbsp; file. It will install the latest xFormers. OK,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA4LksIVas8&t=253) there is one more thing left, which is installing&nbsp; the requirements of the DreamBooth extension. So&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA4LksIVas8&t=258) go inside your extensions, inside your DreamBooth&nbsp; extension folder. Click plus. Open a new terminal.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA4LksIVas8&t=265) You see currently my terminal is inside extensions&nbsp; folder. Type pip install dash r requirements txt&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA4LksIVas8&t=273) as I am showing here. Copy it and paste it. And&nbsp; it will install the requirements of the DreamBooth&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA4LksIVas8&t=280) extension. Then meanwhile, let's also download the&nbsp; best model for training. Go inside your models.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA4LksIVas8&t=286) Inside Stable Diffusion, open a new terminal.&nbsp; Then copy paste this line, which will download&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA4LksIVas8&t=293) the 1.5 pruned ckpt file. Copy and paste it. It&nbsp; will download it. Let's also download the best VAE&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA4LksIVas8&t=300) file. To VAE file, go to the models. Go to the VAE&nbsp; folder. Copy this link. Then inside VAE folder,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA4LksIVas8&t=307) open a new terminal. Paste it and it will download&nbsp; it here. OK, so the download of the VAE file is&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA4LksIVas8&t=314) completed. The download of the model is completed.&nbsp; And the installation of the DreamBooth extension&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA4LksIVas8&t=320) requirements has been completed. Now we will&nbsp; restart our pod. To do that, go to the restart pod&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA4LksIVas8&t=327) like this. After restart has been completed, click&nbsp; connect. Connect to JupyterLab. This may take a&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA4LksIVas8&t=333) while. So when you restart or start your RunPod,&nbsp; it will start an instance of web UI. We are going&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA4LksIVas8&t=339) to terminate that web UI with this command, fuser&nbsp; -k 3000/tcp. So to do that, go to inside your&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA4LksIVas8&t=347) Stable Diffusion web UI. Click plus icon. Open&nbsp; a new terminal. Type it. It is killed now. Once&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA4LksIVas8&t=353) your existing web UI is terminated, you will see&nbsp; that the GPU memory used is 0%. Now we will start&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA4LksIVas8&t=361) the web UI ourselves. To do that, you need to type&nbsp; python relauncher.py. This has to be called inside&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA4LksIVas8&t=367) Stable Diffusion web UI folder. It will restart&nbsp; your web UI. You will get some warnings like this,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA4LksIVas8&t=373) but you can ignore them. Web UI has been&nbsp; started. There is no errors. Then for connecting,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA4LksIVas8&t=380) I am going to use connect and 3000 HTTP port. This&nbsp; is working a little bit faster. And now everything&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA4LksIVas8&t=387) is loaded. Let's try 1.5 pruned ckpt file. Also,&nbsp; currently we are using the latest version of&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA4LksIVas8&t=395) Automatic1111 web UI. The latest version of&nbsp; the xFormers. Unfortunately, Torch version 2&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA4LksIVas8&t=401) is still not working on RunPod. Therefore, we are&nbsp; using Torch 1.13 and CUDA 11.7. But this is also&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA4LksIVas8&t=408) working very fast. Then make a test. Car. So image&nbsp; has been generated. Let's go to the DreamBooth.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA4LksIVas8&t=414) Let's compose a model. Test. Source checkpoint.&nbsp; 1.5 pruned ckpt, unfreeze model. Create model.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA4LksIVas8&t=421) With this way, you are able to see the CMD, the&nbsp; command line interface of the web UI. If you&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA4LksIVas8&t=427) don't terminate it yourself, you won't be able to&nbsp; see that in this screen. So this approach is best&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA4LksIVas8&t=433) way for RunPod. By the way, let's also set the&nbsp; VAE file. Go to the settings. In here, you will&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA4LksIVas8&t=439) see Stable Diffusion. SD VAE you see. Make it this&nbsp; downloaded VAE file and click apply settings. It&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA4LksIVas8&t=447) is changed. Let's go back to our DreamBooth. Okay,&nbsp; the model has been generated and it is selected.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA4LksIVas8&t=452) So I will make a quick demonstration for you.&nbsp; Let's make a new folder, training images. Let&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA4LksIVas8&t=458) me upload my files there. I will just drag and&nbsp; drop them. Okay, the files are uploaded. Let's&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA4LksIVas8&t=464) make the best settings. First click performance&nbsp; wizard, then concept training wizard. So the best&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA4LksIVas8&t=469) settings I have found are like this. I'm not&nbsp; changing anything. By the way, these settings&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA4LksIVas8&t=474) are set for 20 GB. So it may change based on your&nbsp; VRAM. So this is 1e-7. In here, use EMA. I will&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA4LksIVas8&t=483) use Lion. bf16. I am not going to use xFormers,&nbsp; but you can use that as well. Cache latents,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA4LksIVas8&t=488) train UNET. This is really important. Step ratio&nbsp; text encoders, 75%. And weight decay will be 0.1%&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA4LksIVas8&t=497) because we are using Lion. And when you are&nbsp; using Lion, this is the learning rate. Okay,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA4LksIVas8&t=502) for quickly starting the training, let's copy the&nbsp; path of the train images. Paste it there. Don't&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA4LksIVas8&t=509) forget the backslash. Copy and paste it like this.&nbsp; And let's make it class. ohwx man is our instance&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA4LksIVas8&t=516) token. Photo of man is our class token. Normally&nbsp; you would need 50. But for quick test, I will&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA4LksIVas8&t=523) make it 1. So we will see. It will generate the&nbsp; classification images. But using text to image tab&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA4LksIVas8&t=530) is better for generating classification images. I&nbsp; am explaining that in my other videos. So then go&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA4LksIVas8&t=536) to the saving tab. Generate a ckpt. We can also&nbsp; make this like 200 and save every 10 epochs. Then&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA4LksIVas8&t=542) you can compare epochs. So I will save previews&nbsp; every one epoch to demonstrate to you. But I am&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA4LksIVas8&t=550) usually making this zero then I am using xyz plot&nbsp; checkpoint comparison. Save settings and click&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA4LksIVas8&t=556) load settings to not get any error. Then train.&nbsp; Okay, first it will generate the classification&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA4LksIVas8&t=562) images. Since we did set as one, it will&nbsp; generate 17. It is generating them right now. Oh,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA4LksIVas8&t=568) by the way, we have forgotten the sample image&nbsp; prompt. Therefore, it won't be able to generate&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA4LksIVas8&t=573) correct images. We should have typed here photo of&nbsp; ohwx man. So I will just cancel and then restart.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA4LksIVas8&t=582) I also have a sample data set which has 6000&nbsp; images. And I posted that on our Patreon page.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA4LksIVas8&t=589) You will see our Patreon page both in the comments&nbsp; and the description of this video. You can click&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA4LksIVas8&t=595) the Patreon. Then on our Patreon, you will see&nbsp; this post. Okay, you see the training has started.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA4LksIVas8&t=601) Now I will just cancel. Okay, then save settings,&nbsp; load settings. You see there is some random image&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA4LksIVas8&t=607) because we have forgotten to set sample image&nbsp; prompt. And then train. This time it won't&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA4LksIVas8&t=612) generate any more classification images because we&nbsp; already have them generated. Okay, you see I have&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA4LksIVas8&t=619) an error this time out of memory error. I think&nbsp; this is because of memory leakage. So therefore,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA4LksIVas8&t=625) I will restart pod and start again. Okay, after&nbsp; restart, it started training and it is using&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA4LksIVas8&t=631) 18.1 gigabytes VRAM currently. We are not using&nbsp; gradient checkpointing. When you enable it, it&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA4LksIVas8&t=638) will also reduce VRAM usage. And the first sample&nbsp; is also generated very well. Okay, after just 20&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA4LksIVas8&t=645) epochs, I am able to get very resembling images.&nbsp; And as the training continues, it will get better.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA4LksIVas8&t=651) However, I have noticed that I used the rare token&nbsp; incorrectly. So be careful with that. Whatever the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA4LksIVas8&t=657) rare token you teach, you need to use that. Both&nbsp; in the sample images and both in the text to image&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA4LksIVas8&t=664) tab. So DreamBooth extension currently working&nbsp; very well and very fast. And the stable diffusion&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA4LksIVas8&t=670) and the Web UI working very well and very fast&nbsp; on the RunPod with this methodology, I just have&nbsp;&nbsp;
