TRELLIS is a large 3D asset generation model. It takes in text or image prompts and generates high-quality 3D assets in various formats, such as Radiance Fields, 3D Gaussians, and meshes. The cornerstone of TRELLIS is a unified Structured LATent (SLAT) representation that allows decoding to different output formats and Rectified Flow Transformers tailored for SLAT as the powerful backbones. We provide large-scale pre-trained models with up to 2 billion parameters on a large 3D asset dataset of 500K diverse objects. TRELLIS significantly surpasses existing methods, including recent ones at similar scales, and showcases flexible output format selection and local 3D editing capabilities which were not offered by previous models.

- [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EhU7Jil9WAk&t=0) And final generated vertices and faces are&nbsp; here. We can see that, and the file has been&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EhU7Jil9WAk&t=7) generated. This is just amazing. I mean, from&nbsp; this single image, we get this output. Can you&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EhU7Jil9WAk&t=14) imagine that? Can you imagine the details?&nbsp; And we can see the generated GLB file here,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EhU7Jil9WAk&t=20) which you can use. This is just beyond amazing. Greetings, everyone. Today, I am going to&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EhU7Jil9WAk&t=26) introduce you Trellis, which is perhaps the very&nbsp; best image-to-3D generator. So, with this model,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EhU7Jil9WAk&t=34) you can use images and generate full 3D models,&nbsp; the GLB files that you can import into your 3D&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EhU7Jil9WAk&t=46) applications and directly use them, with including&nbsp; the texture, as you are seeing right now. This&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EhU7Jil9WAk&t=52) model has been published by the Microsoft itself&nbsp; on the GitHub. It is an open-source model. You can&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EhU7Jil9WAk&t=59) run this locally on your computer to generate 3D&nbsp; models, full 3D models from just images. Moreover,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EhU7Jil9WAk&t=69) this model supports multi-angle images&nbsp; to do 3D models as well, to improve the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EhU7Jil9WAk&t=77) quality of the generation, as you are seeing&nbsp; right now. And I have developed an amazing,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EhU7Jil9WAk&t=82) a very advanced Gradio application for this model&nbsp; to run locally or on the private cloud services&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EhU7Jil9WAk&t=91) such as RunPod or Massed Compute. As you are&nbsp; seeing, this is running in the Massed Compute,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EhU7Jil9WAk&t=97) and this is running in the RunPod. Moreover, I&nbsp; have spent huge time to compile a lot of libraries&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EhU7Jil9WAk&t=104) to make this application work with RTX 5000 series&nbsp; as well, and it supports all the GPUs as well,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EhU7Jil9WAk&t=111) like RTX 3000, 2000, 5000, 4000. It should support&nbsp; all of them. But we are not done yet. I have added&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EhU7Jil9WAk&t=120) some of the amazing features that you would&nbsp; expect, such as number of generations, such&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EhU7Jil9WAk&t=126) as configuration presets that you can set, such&nbsp; as the video output settings. Let me demonstrate&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EhU7Jil9WAk&t=132) you. So, let's open the generations to see the&nbsp; generated video. Let's click to open, and when we&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EhU7Jil9WAk&t=139) go to the video, we can see the generated videos.&nbsp; So, this is the original generated video. It's&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EhU7Jil9WAk&t=146) very high resolution. Moreover, you can set the&nbsp; video output settings, number of frames, the FPS.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EhU7Jil9WAk&t=152) But we are not done yet. You can generate very&nbsp; dense, very detailed mesh files. It is totally&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EhU7Jil9WAk&t=159) up to you. Moreover, you can generate texture&nbsp; size bigger pixels, and we also save metadata,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EhU7Jil9WAk&t=168) and we support batch processing. So, you can give&nbsp; a folder of images, and it will process all of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EhU7Jil9WAk&t=174) images and generate both videos, GLB files, and&nbsp; also Gaussian files from all of the images. But we&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EhU7Jil9WAk&t=184) are not done yet. My one-click installers install&nbsp; into a virtual environment with Flash Attention&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EhU7Jil9WAk&t=191) support by default. So, it will work with the&nbsp; maximum performance on your computer. Moreover,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EhU7Jil9WAk&t=197) we support high VRAM and low VRAM module. When you&nbsp; run the application as low VRAM, it works as low&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EhU7Jil9WAk&t=205) as 6 GB VRAM GPUs. With high VRAM, it uses like 10&nbsp; or 12 GB of VRAM. I also thanks to Trellis stable&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EhU7Jil9WAk&t=215) project authors' repo because I have forked&nbsp; from them, and they had done some amazing work,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EhU7Jil9WAk&t=222) but I added a lot of things to top of it. Preparation of the one-click installer was a huge&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EhU7Jil9WAk&t=229) task because I had to compile a lot of libraries&nbsp; both for Windows and both for Linux to make this&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EhU7Jil9WAk&t=238) application work seamlessly without requiring&nbsp; any expertise from your side. So, I have compiled&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EhU7Jil9WAk&t=245) Flash Attention for all GPUs, xFormers for all&nbsp; GPUs. I also compiled these libraries so that it&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EhU7Jil9WAk&t=253) will install directly into your computer or into&nbsp; RunPod and Massed Compute, and it will work. So,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EhU7Jil9WAk&t=260) how you can get this application and use it? We&nbsp; have an amazing article for that. The link will be&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EhU7Jil9WAk&t=267) in the description of the video. So, download the&nbsp; latest zip file. You see, it is here. Just click&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EhU7Jil9WAk&t=272) to download. Before installing, make sure that you&nbsp; have followed these public Windows requirements&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EhU7Jil9WAk&t=279) tutorial, but follow every step. This is really&nbsp; important. Once you've done that, you are ready to&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EhU7Jil9WAk&t=285) begin installation. So, move the zip file into any&nbsp; disk which you want to install. So, let's install&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EhU7Jil9WAk&t=292) into my Q drive. Make sure that it is not a cloud&nbsp; drive like Google Drive or OneDrive, and do not&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EhU7Jil9WAk&t=300) use spaces or special characters in your folder&nbsp; path. Then, just double-click Windows install.bat&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EhU7Jil9WAk&t=306) file, more info, run anyway. Do not run any of my&nbsp; applications as administrators unless you are told&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EhU7Jil9WAk&t=315) to. And so far, none of my applications requiring&nbsp; running as administrator. What will this do is&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EhU7Jil9WAk&t=323) that it will automatically install everything,&nbsp; all of the libraries for you. It will install&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EhU7Jil9WAk&t=329) the application. It will generate a virtual&nbsp; environment, and it will download models. So,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EhU7Jil9WAk&t=334) since I install everything into a virtual&nbsp; environment, it will not break or impact any other&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EhU7Jil9WAk&t=341) of your applications. Since I have pre-compiled&nbsp; everything, the installation will be fairly fast&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EhU7Jil9WAk&t=348) for you, and it should be very straightforward&nbsp; without any errors. Once the installation has&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EhU7Jil9WAk&t=354) been completed, it will automatically download the&nbsp; necessary models into the Trellis models folder,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EhU7Jil9WAk&t=361) which we will see in a moment. If the model&nbsp; download fails for any reason, you can use&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EhU7Jil9WAk&t=366) Windows download models.bat file, and you can&nbsp; continue downloading, resuming downloading. So,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EhU7Jil9WAk&t=373) the installation is about to be completed. This&nbsp; application depends on so many, so many different&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EhU7Jil9WAk&t=378) libraries. Therefore, it is really, really hard&nbsp; to install. I had spent huge time to make this&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EhU7Jil9WAk&t=384) installer and this application for you. And the&nbsp; VRAM optimizations that we have is amazing. So,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EhU7Jil9WAk&t=391) even if you have a low VRAM GPU, it will work.&nbsp; And if you have a higher VRAM GPU, like 12 GB or&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EhU7Jil9WAk&t=396) above, it will work faster. So, the installation&nbsp; has been completed, and now it is downloading the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EhU7Jil9WAk&t=401) necessary model files, the AI models, and they are&nbsp; downloaded, and everything has been completed. So,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EhU7Jil9WAk&t=407) when we check the folder size because sometimes&nbsp; this is asked of me, it is total 13.5 GB of disk&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EhU7Jil9WAk&t=416) space. So, for running, if you have a very older&nbsp; GPU, like RTX 2000 or below, you can use this .bat&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EhU7Jil9WAk&t=424) file to uninstall Flash Attention and use the&nbsp; default xFormers. If you have a low VRAM GPU,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EhU7Jil9WAk&t=430) like 8 GB or below, you can use this low VRAM.&nbsp; But if you have a decent GPU, like 12 or above,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EhU7Jil9WAk&t=436) then all you need to do is double-click Windows&nbsp; start.bat file. It will start the application&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EhU7Jil9WAk&t=442) with default mode, which works really, really fast&nbsp; and efficient. The first time loading may be slow,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EhU7Jil9WAk&t=450) so just patiently wait. Let me also show you&nbsp; my GPUs. So, open a terminal. Let's install&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EhU7Jil9WAk&t=456) pip install nvitop. This is not mandatory, but&nbsp; just to show you an nvitop. So, I have RTX 5090,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EhU7Jil9WAk&t=464) and I have RTX 3090 TI. The application tested&nbsp; on both GPUs and works perfect. So, you see,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EhU7Jil9WAk&t=470) it shows that it is using Flash Attention&nbsp; as a backend. All right, the application&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EhU7Jil9WAk&t=475) has been started. We can see that we are using&nbsp; full precision. We are using high VRAM mode,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EhU7Jil9WAk&t=480) so everything will stay on the GPU, and we are&nbsp; using FP32 precision. So, how this application&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EhU7Jil9WAk&t=488) works, you just need to upload your image into&nbsp; here. Let's find a 3D car image, but you can&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EhU7Jil9WAk&t=495) use any images. It also automatically removes the&nbsp; background. So, for example, let's try this image.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EhU7Jil9WAk&t=503) Save as this image into your downloads. Then,&nbsp; click here, go to downloads, and let's select the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EhU7Jil9WAk&t=509) image. We got the image. You see, the background&nbsp; has been automatically removed. Then, generate&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EhU7Jil9WAk&t=514) and extract all. So, what are the options?&nbsp; We have seed, and whenever you change seed,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EhU7Jil9WAk&t=520) it will generate a new 3D mesh. Moreover, you can&nbsp; increase number of sampling steps. It will improve&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EhU7Jil9WAk&t=529) the quality. You can change the guidance strength,&nbsp; so it will impact the final output. Moreover,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EhU7Jil9WAk&t=536) you can change the mesh simplification factor.&nbsp; As you reduce this number, it will increase the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EhU7Jil9WAk&t=543) number of vertices and triangles in your generated&nbsp; file. We can say that it will increase the number&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EhU7Jil9WAk&t=550) of used final faces and edges. All the numbers are&nbsp; displayed here, as you are seeing right now. So,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EhU7Jil9WAk&t=557) the processing of this image has been completed.&nbsp; You see, it shows that after remove invisible&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EhU7Jil9WAk&t=563) faces, there are 8,000 vertices and 17,000&nbsp; faces in our generated model. And we can see&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EhU7Jil9WAk&t=571) our generated model. By the way, this image&nbsp; is not very great. This is just an image we&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EhU7Jil9WAk&t=576) found from the internet, but we can see it has&nbsp; generated this. Let's use one of the more proper&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EhU7Jil9WAk&t=582) examples from our example images. I like this one&nbsp; pretty much. This is a very advanced image. And&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EhU7Jil9WAk&t=590) what else we can change? We can also increase the&nbsp; texture size, and let's make this like 70%. So,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EhU7Jil9WAk&t=596) it will generate more faces. Okay, we can see the&nbsp; progress here. First of all, it is generating the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EhU7Jil9WAk&t=602) 3D model. Then, it will generate the GLB file,&nbsp; which you can use for import. All of these files&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EhU7Jil9WAk&t=610) are automatically saved inside outputs folder.&nbsp; So, when you click the open outputs folder,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EhU7Jil9WAk&t=616) it will open it. And you can see that Gaussian&nbsp; files are saved here. GLB files are saved here.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EhU7Jil9WAk&t=622) Metadata of the generations are saved here.&nbsp; And also, generated videos are saved there. So,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EhU7Jil9WAk&t=628) the processing is continuing. We can see that&nbsp; before post-process, the total number of vertices&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EhU7Jil9WAk&t=634) and faces are immense. 594,352 vertices&nbsp; and 1.2 million faces. This is the original&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EhU7Jil9WAk&t=644) generation. You can imagine the massiveness and&nbsp; details of this model. Then, we do optimization,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EhU7Jil9WAk&t=652) and final generated vertices and faces are&nbsp; here. We can see that, and the file has been&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EhU7Jil9WAk&t=659) generated. This is just amazing. I mean, from this&nbsp; single image, we get this output. Can you imagine&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EhU7Jil9WAk&t=666) that? Can you imagine the details? And we can see&nbsp; the generated GLB file here, which you can use.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EhU7Jil9WAk&t=673) This is just beyond amazing. Amazing quality.&nbsp; So, if you are working with 3D, this can help&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EhU7Jil9WAk&t=680) you significantly. I also made the texture size&nbsp; 2 megapixel, 2048 pixels, so it improved the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EhU7Jil9WAk&t=688) quality. So, this is it. You can also use multiple&nbsp; angle of images. That can improve the quality. For&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EhU7Jil9WAk&t=695) example, if I click this image, it will upload&nbsp; three images here. So, that is how it works.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EhU7Jil9WAk&t=701) You upload multiple angles of the images into&nbsp; here. Then, you click generate and extract all,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EhU7Jil9WAk&t=707) and it will do automatically for you. So, this&nbsp; is currently running on my local computer. You&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EhU7Jil9WAk&t=713) see that even though I am recording a video, on my&nbsp; primary GPU, I am not even surpassing 12 GB. So,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EhU7Jil9WAk&t=719) if you have a 12 GB GPU, you can run this in the&nbsp; high VRAM mode. And if we have 8 GB or 6 GB GPU,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EhU7Jil9WAk&t=727) you can use the low VRAM mode. What about running&nbsp; this on Massed Compute and RunPod? We already have&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EhU7Jil9WAk&t=733) RunPod instructions.txt file and Massed Compute&nbsp; instructions.txt files. Just read and apply them,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EhU7Jil9WAk&t=740) and it will work immediately without any issues&nbsp; for you. Hopefully, I will make a separate new&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EhU7Jil9WAk&t=746) video for show you how to use Massed Compute and&nbsp; RunPod, but we also already have some tutorials&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EhU7Jil9WAk&t=753) for them. For example, starting from 12.87,&nbsp; you can watch this to learn Massed Compute,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EhU7Jil9WAk&t=760) and when we open the RunPod instructions, you&nbsp; can watch this from 22 minutes to learn how to&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EhU7Jil9WAk&t=766) use it on RunPod. Okay, the generation has been&nbsp; completed. We can see the generated model is here,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EhU7Jil9WAk&t=772) and this is the GLB file it has generated. This is&nbsp; just amazing. You see? When you provide multiple&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EhU7Jil9WAk&t=780) angles, it works even better. So, that's it, guys.&nbsp; Hopefully, see you in another amazing tutorial&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EhU7Jil9WAk&t=787) video. The link of the zip file will be in the&nbsp; description of the video and also in the comment&nbsp;&nbsp;
