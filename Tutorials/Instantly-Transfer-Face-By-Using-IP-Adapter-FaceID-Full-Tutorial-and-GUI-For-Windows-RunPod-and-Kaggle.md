### Video Transcription


- [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=0) Greetings, everyone.

- [00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=1) Welcome to the IP Adapter Face ID Full Tutorial.

- [00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=5) In this tutorial, I will show you how to install and use IP Adapter Face ID model.

- [00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=11) This is an experimental version of IP Adapter Face ID with ID embedding from face recognition

- [00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=18) model instead of CLIP image embedding.

- [00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=21) I have coded an amazing Gradio application and one-click installer for this model.

- [00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=27) You will be able to quickly select with the any base model, upload image, and generate

- [00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=33) images as easy as Automatic1111 Web UI.

- [00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=36) You will be able to transfer faces with one click.

- [00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=40) This doesn't require any training.

- [00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=42) You can directly transfer faces and generate amazing images.

- [00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=47) So the Gradio application I developed works on Linux, on Windows, on RunPod, on Kaggle.

- [00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=53) Moreover, it supports SDXL models as well.

- [00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=57) It supports a number of images to generate, batch size, number of inference steps, width,

- [00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=62) height, CFG, randomized seed, negative prompt, positive prompt.

- [00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=66) It also has a feature to convert models into the diffusers format.

- [00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=71) So you will be able to use any CivitAI models as well, not only the models hosted on Hugging

- [00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=78) Face.

- [00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=79) I will show how to install and use this web UI on RunPod with including how to extract

- [00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=86) and use custom models.

- [00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=87) Moreover, with a specially developed Kaggle notebook, I will show you how to install and

- [00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=93) use this on Kaggle, even exporting diffusers format on Kaggle and using that.

- [00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=99) Also, download all the generated images with one click.

- [00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=102) If you don't have a strong GPU and if you don't have a budget, then you can use the

- [00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=107) Kaggle notebook.

- [00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=108) If you have a budget, then you can use RunPod, which is even better and easier than Kaggle

- [00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=112) to use.

- [00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=113) Or if you have a medium quality GPU, you can use this on your machine.

- [00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=119) Because the Gradio application I developed is using a minimal amount of VRAM and with

- [00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=125) all of the optimizers, including even the Triton package.

- [00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=130) So everything we need to follow this tutorial is shared in this Patreon post with detailed

- [00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=136) explanations and also links.

- [00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=139) To follow this tutorial on Windows, you need to have C++ tools installed and Python 3.10

- [00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=146) installed.

- [00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=147) If you don't know how to install them, please watch this amazing tutorial.

- [00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=152) This tutorial is fully chaptered.

- [00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=154) Just check out the description and look at the parts that you don't know.

- [00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=159) Once you have installed C++ tools and Python 3.10, then you are ready to follow this tutorial.

- [00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=165) Automatically, the web UI will download models into your Hugging Face hub, which is by default

- [00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=174) set into your user's environment.

- [00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=175) Let me show you.

- [00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=177) Enter inside your user's folder, enter inside your username, enter inside cache, enter inside

- [00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=184) Hugging Face and enter inside hub.

- [00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=187) This is where the models will be downloaded automatically from Hugging Face.

- [00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=192) By using this command, you can change the default download folder into any drive that

- [00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=198) you want.

- [00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=199) But don't worry, I also have a local model installation feature in the web UI.

- [00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=205) Moreover, I will show RunPod installation and Kaggle installation as well on a free

- [00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=210) Kaggle notebook.

- [00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=211) So if you don't have a strong GPU, you can use Kaggle or if you are willing to spend

- [00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=216) money, you can use RunPod, which is even better than Kaggle.

- [00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=219) So for starting, go to the very bottom and you will see the attachments here.

- [00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=224) Download plus IP version 10.

- [00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=226) When you are watching this tutorial, the file could have been updated.

- [00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=230) Always read the latest updates in the very top.

- [00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=234) So let's go to the downloads folder.

- [00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=236) Let's go to the installation folder.

- [00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=238) I will install inside my G drive.

- [00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=240) Let's say video face enter inside it, paste the file, extract here.

- [00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=246) This is a zip file so you can extract.

- [00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=249) By the way, do not use any space character or non-English character in your folder path

- [00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=255) because it may not work.

- [00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=256) Then all you need to do is double-click install that bat file it will download and install

- [00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=261) everything fully automatically for you.

- [00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=263) The IP adapter face ID recently also added SDXL model and I also implemented it.

- [00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=269) Actually, I am recording this video the second time since this was recently added.

- [00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=274) So I wanted to cover it as well.

- [00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=275) And if there will be any new changes, I will update the web UI further for you.

- [00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=281) So it started installing.

- [00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=283) Everything is fully automatic.

- [00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=284) You don't need to do anything else.

- [00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=285) The installer will generate its own virtual environment folder.

- [00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=289) Therefore, this installation will not conflict or affect any other of your AI application

- [00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=295) or application.

- [00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=297) Everything will be installed inside this virtual environment folder.

- [00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=300) The special installer script I have coded with installed even Triton package for windows.

- [00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=307) So it will work with the most up-to-date libraries and also with the most possible speed.

- [00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=313) Right now it is downloading the models that you need.

- [00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=316) The installation of the libraries has been completed.

- [00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=320) Always verify whether there are any errors or not after the installation has been completed.

- [00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=326) From which sources models are downloaded will be displayed on the CMD as you are seeing

- [00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=330) right now.

- [00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=331) So the installation has been completed.

- [00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=333) Then press any key to continue.

- [00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=335) To start the web UI, just double click run web app that bat file and the interface will

- [00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=341) automatically start in your web browser.

- [00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=344) So there are several key things here.

- [00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=346) You see there is activate SDXL when this option is selected.

- [00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=351) You need to use SDXL models.

- [00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=353) You need to load your face including image first.

- [00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=358) So let's click here.

- [00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=359) Let's go to downloads and let's use this image.

- [00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=363) Wait until image appears here.

- [00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=365) Set the output resolution 512 to 768.

- [00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=369) Set the CFG value, number of inference steps, the seed randomized seed, number of images

- [00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=375) to generate.

- [00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=376) This will do a loop of generation and batch size.

- [00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=379) Batch size means that it will generate multiple images at the same time.

- [00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=383) Therefore, it will use more VRAM.

- [00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=386) Enable shortcut.

- [00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=387) I don't know what this is doing.

- [00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=388) I added it as an option because the official repository has it.

- [00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=392) There is also scale factor.

- [00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=393) I haven't tested it yet too.

- [00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=395) Then type your prompt here.

- [00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=397) A man wearing an expensive suit.

- [00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=400) Type your negative prompt if you wish.

- [00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=402) Select the base model here.

- [00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=404) These models are the paths of Hugging Face repositories.

- [00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=409) You can also give your local computer path which I will explain.

- [00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=413) So let's select our models.

- [00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=415) The first ones, the top ones are Stable Diffusion SD 1.5 based models.

- [00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=421) From here anime illustration diffusion XL.

- [00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=424) The bottom ones are SDXL models.

- [00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=427) So I will pick the flat 2D animerge.

- [00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=431) You can also copy this and paste it into your browser and you will get the Hugging Face

- [00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=436) repository.

- [00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=437) So when you copy this, this is the repository path.

- [00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=440) This will automatically download the files into your Hugging Face cache folder which

- [00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=445) I have shown in the beginning of the video.

- [00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=447) Then hit generate.

- [00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=449) Then follow the progress.

- [00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=450) Here it will load the model.

- [00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=452) You will also get the same messages as me.

- [00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=455) It will first use insightface to get the face.

- [00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=459) Then it will generate the image with the number of steps that we have.

- [00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=462) And the image is generated as you are seeing right now.

- [00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=465) It is pretty cool, pretty decent quality.

- [00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=468) Actually looking pretty amazing.

- [00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=470) So what does this custom model path do?

- [00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=473) Let's say you want to use Inkpunk diffusion.

- [00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=476) Let's verify it is SD 1.5 when we check out the file.

- [00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=479) Yes, this is SD 1.5.

- [00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=482) I know it from the size of it.

- [00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=485) Then copy this path and paste the custom model path here.

- [00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=489) Alternatively, you can also add it to the select model.

- [00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=492) How can you do that?

- [00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=493) Go to your download web UI.py file, edit it.

- [00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=497) I will use Notepad++ to edit.

- [00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=500) And in here, you see static model names.

- [00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=502) You just need to paste it here like this and restart the web UI.

- [00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=508) Alternatively, copy paste it here.

- [00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=509) When you use something here, the web UI will read this model path instead of select model.

- [00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=516) So let's hit generate.

- [00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=517) Now it will download the model from Hugging Face into our cache folder automatically for

- [00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=522) us.

- [00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=523) Once the model is downloaded, it will start generating and we got the image with this

- [00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=527) model, which one Inkpunk diffusion as you are seeing right now.

- [00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=532) So let's say you have a model from CivitAI.

- [00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=534) How to use it?

- [00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=535) For example, let's try this model.

- [00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=538) The latest version is selected.

- [00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=539) Go to downloads options, download the model safetensors file.

- [00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=543) It has a trigger word, so I will also use this trigger word.

- [00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=546) Okay, the model has been downloaded.

- [00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=548) Let's open the folder while pressing your left shift key, right click, copy as path,

- [00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=556) go to the very bottom.

- [00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=557) In the very bottom, we have checkpoint file path and output folder to convert model.

- [00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=563) If you're converting SD 1.5, do not check this.

- [00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=567) If you're converting SDXL model, check this checkbox.

- [00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=570) So then go to the here, remove the quotation marks.

- [00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=573) This is the path of the file then enter output folder.

- [00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=577) So I will convert it into my G drive.

- [00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=581) Let's type as like this and that's it and hit convert model.

- [00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=585) Just wait a little bit.

- [00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=586) It will load the model into the VRAM and then it will export it as diffusers files.

- [00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=593) Okay, the conversion has been completed.

- [00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=596) It says conversion status.

- [00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=598) Let's go to the G drive and inside here.

- [00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=600) Now we have the model extracted as a diffusers model.

- [00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=605) Copy this path, go to custom model path and paste it here then hit generate and it will

- [00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=610) load this model and generate the image for you.

- [00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=614) Follow the CMD window to see what's happening.

- [00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=617) It is first loading model then generating the image and the image is generated looking

- [00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=622) pretty decent.

- [00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=624) You can click this arrow icon to download images.

- [00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=628) Moreover, all of the images generated are saved inside output folder.

- [00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=632) You see all the images we generated here.

- [00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=635) So this is how you can use custom models.

- [00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=637) Now let's use an SDXL model.

- [00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=640) For SDXL model, I click activate SDXL.

- [00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=643) I change the width and height of the image because this is the native resolution of SDXL.

- [00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=650) Then I will use the Juggernaut XL model.

- [00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=653) I already have downloaded from CivitAI here.

- [00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=656) So right-click with shift key, copy as path, copy paste it here, then I will extract it

- [00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=663) into my G drive again.

- [00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=665) So let's type the model folder path like this and convert model.

- [00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=670) This will extract the model as diffusers.

- [00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=673) You may be wondering why we have to extract as diffusers.

- [00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=676) I don't know because when you load it from the single pre-trained model pipeline, it

- [00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=683) doesn't work.

- [00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=684) I told this to the developer and he doesn't know either.

- [00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=687) So we have to use diffusers files and the model has been converted and saved.

- [00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=691) So copy this, paste into custom model path and generate.

- [00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=695) And let's see what we will get.

- [00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=697) Again, if you want these models to appear here, go back to your web UI.py file, paste

- [00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=704) the path like this, put an R letter into the beginning and restart the web UI and then

- [00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=711) you will have them in the drop-down menu.

- [00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=714) Okay, it is generating.

- [00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=716) Of course, SDXL is a little bit slower and we got the image.

- [00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=720) So this is the image that Juggernaut XL run diffusion generated.

- [00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=725) You can test any SDXL model as well.

- [00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=728) You can use them directly from Hugging Face or use the convert model option.

- [00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=733) I have coded this entire Gradio application from scratch for you.

- [00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=738) Also, if anything new is added here, I will also implement them to the Gradio application

- [00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=744) hopefully.

- [00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=745) This is a very lightweight Gradio application.

- [00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=748) This will not break anything else.

- [00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=750) This will work standalone.

- [00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=752) So this is really, really cool when you consider it.

- [00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=754) And I have added most of the features that you will need to use such as number of images

- [00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=759) to generate, batch size.

- [00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=761) For example, let's generate three images and let's make it red expensive suit and generate.

- [00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=767) Then you can follow the output folder.

- [00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=769) Each of the image will be saved here.

- [00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=772) Once they are generated, you can also see the progress here.

- [00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=776) So this is the first image we got.

- [00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=778) By the way, I find that this is working better for stylized images like anime, like 3D; for

- [00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=785) realism, this is still not as good as training the images with DreamBooth training.

- [00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=791) So therefore, if you are looking for stylized images, this is really cool.

- [00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=795) Okay, the three images are generated.

- [00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=797) You can see them as like this.

- [00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=799) By the way, I think SD 1.5 is still better than SDXL.

- [00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=803) I believe the developer is still working to improve the model's quality.

- [00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=808) OK, now I will show how to install on RunPod.

- [00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=812) To install on RunPod, we have all the instructions here.

- [00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=815) First, register your account on RunPod or login.

- [00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=819) So click this link, login.

- [00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=822) If you don't know how to use RunPod, on our channel, in our videos, type here RunPod and

- [00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=827) you will see all of our RunPod tutorials.

- [00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=829) I have so many tutorials.

- [00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=831) This is the master tutorial.

- [00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=833) Watching every one of the RunPod stories will help you significantly.

- [00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=835) Then, on this interface, let's go to the Community Cloud.

- [00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=839) You can also use Secure Cloud.

- [00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=841) You can also use storage if you want.

- [00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=843) Select Extreme Speed.

- [00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=844) I will do the testing with RTX 3090, deploy.

- [00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=849) The instructions are here.

- [00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=850) You can use any template.

- [00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=852) I will use the RunPod PyTorch template for this, but you can use any template.

- [00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=857) So type here PyTorch and select the PyTorch template, customize deployment, select the

- [00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=863) volume disk like 50 gigabytes.

- [00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=866) Decide how many models that you are going to use, how many models you are going to download,

- [00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=870) set overrides, click continue, click deploy, then click my pods.

- [00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=875) On this screen, wait until the connect button appears.

- [00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=878) This template is pretty lightweight, so loading it is not taking too much time.

- [00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=883) So it is already completed.

- [00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=885) Pod uptime is 15 seconds.

- [00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=886) Click connect, connect to JupyterLab, wait until Jupyter interface loads.

- [00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=892) Then as the instruction says, we will upload all the files into the workspace.

- [00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=897) So in the workspace, click this arrow icon, go to your download, which is here, select

- [00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=903) the files like this.

- [00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=905) You don't need to upload Kaggle file, but you can upload, it doesn't matter.

- [00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=909) Click a terminal, then copy this command.

- [00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=912) This will install, paste it, hit enter.

- [00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=915) It will install everything automatically for us, and it will also download the necessary

- [00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=919) models.

- [00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=920) This will generate its own virtual environment folder.

- [00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=923) So if you use Stable Diffusion template, make sure that you have uploaded these files inside

- [00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=929) another folder so that you will not have a conflict with Automatic1111 Web UI virtual

- [00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=935) environment folder.

- [00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=936) So pay attention to that.

- [00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=937) So the installation has been completed.

- [00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=939) Then open a new terminal.

- [00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=941) To start it, copy this command.

- [00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=943) This command will also set the default folder of HuggingFace cache folder as workspace,

- [00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=949) paste it, hit enter.

- [00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=951) It will activate the virtual environment and start the web UI automatically for us with

- [00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=956) Gradio Live.

- [00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=957) And the Gradio Live started, click it.

- [00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=959) Then the same interface and same features.

- [00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=962) One thing that you need to be careful on RunPod, when you select the image, it will take longer

- [00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=968) to load.

- [00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=969) You see it is uploading, wait until the image appears here.

- [00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=973) This is really important.

- [00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=974) Then set your prompt.

- [00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=976) For example, this time, let's try anything version three, a CGI man image like this and

- [00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=986) hit generate.

- [00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=988) And then it will download the model into the cache folder like in your computer.

- [00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=993) This will be permanently saved in the workspace.

- [00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=997) So you will not have to download it again unless you delete your pod and start again.

- [00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=1003) Alternatively, you can also generate a storage with plus network volume, select your data

- [00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=1009) center, and that storage will remain permanently until you delete it.

- [00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=1014) After you made your network volume, for example, let's select this one.

- [00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=1016) And let's give a name like this, create and deploy, then select the machine and repeat

- [00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=1025) the steps.

- [00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=1026) Each time after that you will do the same and it will be permanently remaining, but

- [00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=1030) I will delete it for now.

- [00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=1032) Okay, let's type the name.

- [00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=1033) All right, the model is getting downloaded.

- [00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=1035) Let's just wait.

- [00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=1037) On RunPod, you can also edit the web UI file, just double-click the web UI.py file and add

- [00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=1044) the models here, then restart the web UI.

- [00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=1047) How you can restart the web UI.

- [00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=1049) First, you need to kill the instance, but the killing command is not installed on every

- [00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=1055) pod.

- [00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=1056) So you can alternatively also go to your pods and from here, click here and restart the

- [00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=1062) pod and it will kill the web UI automatically, of course, then start again.

- [00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=1066) For killing command that you need to use F user -k and the port like this.

- [00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=1074) But since it is started on 7860, this is the port that it started.

- [00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=1080) However, this command is not installed on this template.

- [00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=1083) So you need to install this with apt command.

- [00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=1086) It is downloading the model.

- [00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=1088) So as an extra info, I will also show you how to install that command.

- [00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=1092) Give me Linux command to install fuser and ask to Bard.

- [00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=1098) Bard is for free.

- [00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=1099) Then in here it will give you this command.

- [00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=1102) On RunPod, we don't have sudo.

- [00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=1104) So just copy this part like this, open a new terminal, paste it, but you will get this

- [00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=1110) error.

- [00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=1111) So first you need to do apt update.

- [00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=1114) It will update the libraries list and run the command again and you will have the fuser

- [00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=1119) command.

- [00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=1120) It is installed, but this will be temporary until you turn off your pod and open it again.

- [00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=1125) Okay, model has been downloaded.

- [00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=1127) Now it is going to load the pipeline.

- [00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=1129) It's also downloading the insightface model from deepinsight repository as you're seeing

- [00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=1135) right now.

- [00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=1136) And we got the image as you are seeing.

- [00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=1138) It is looking pretty decent.

- [00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=1140) Okay.

- [00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=1141) Now let's say you want to use a custom CivitAI model on RunPod.

- [00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=1145) So open your model page.

- [00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=1147) I will test with this SDXL model, right-click here and copy link address.

- [00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=1152) In some models, there is also a download button here.

- [00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=1155) In that case, you click that and right-click and download.

- [00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=1158) So I copy link address, open a new terminal on your RunPod.

- [00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=1162) By the way, the interface has been frozen.

- [00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=1164) So let's refresh it.

- [00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=1166) Okay.

- [00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=1167) Interface, refresh it, open a new terminal, type like me: wget quotation mark, paste it

- [00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=1172) in quotation mark then -O then the output file name.

- [00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=1177) Let's give the file name as Samaritan.

- [00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=1180) Okay.

- [00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=1181) Samaritan.

- [00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=1182) the extension safetensors.

- [00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=1185) This will download this model into the workspace because I am running this command inside the

- [00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=1190) workspace folder.

- [00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=1191) You see it started downloading, the file will appear here, you see Samaritan safetensors.

- [00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=1197) Sometimes these may fail because it happened to me.

- [00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=1200) If that happens, click this download, wait it start downloading then on here go to full

- [00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=1206) download history, copy this link address instead of copying link address from here and repeat

- [00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=1213) the same step.

- [00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=1214) Then it will work like this.

- [00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=1216) Let me show: terminal, wget idea, we click it, cancel, so it may not work -o test.safetensors

- [00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=1223) like this, hit enter.

- [00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=1227) And yes, it also started very nice.

- [00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=1229) So I will cancel it with Ctrl + C. Okay, this file did it get downloaded.

- [00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=1234) So to delete the files on RunPod: new terminal, rm -r like this -r the file path test.safetensors.

- [00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=1244) This is the way to delete, do not use interface to delete files because they will be sent

- [00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=1249) into your trashcan and they will still keep your storage full.

- [00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=1254) So the model has been downloaded.

- [00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=1255) Now we will convert it into diffusers.

- [00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=1258) So, right-click here, copy the path, go to your web UI interface, enter it like this,

- [00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=1265) and do not forget to put a backslash at the beginning.

- [00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=1269) Then, type the output; let's say, Samaritan, like this.

- [00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=1274) Make sure that you have selected SDXL from here.

- [00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=1277) Click convert model.

- [00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=1278) It will export the model into the workspace with our folder name.

- [00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=1285) Just patiently wait.

- [00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=1287) You can also follow the progress here.

- [00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=1289) And, is it done?

- [00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=1291) Almost.

- [00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=1292) Okay, it says a connection errored out, but it is not important because it has been exported.

- [00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=1298) Oh, wait, it didn't work.

- [00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=1300) You see, it was killed for a reason.

- [00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=1303) Okay, it says that we were out of memory.

- [00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=1306) I see we have 20 gigabytes of RAM.

- [00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=1310) It should work, actually, but it was killed for some reason.

- [00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=1314) So, let's restart the pod and try again.

- [00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=1317) So, when you are selecting your pod, make sure that it has more RAM, not 20 gigabytes,

- [00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=1323) because 20 gigabytes looks like not enough for exporting SDXL.

- [00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=1327) So, let's connect back to the Jupyter lab, open terminal, let's start the web UI.

- [00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=1333) I will try again and let's see if it will crash this time, too.

- [00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=1337) Also, okay, open the Gradio.

- [00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=1338) Let's copy the path again.

- [00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=1341) Currently, how much RAM?

- [00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=1342) Okay, we are using nothing.

- [00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=1344) Okay, activate SDXL.

- [00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=1346) Put the checkpoint like this.

- [00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=1348) I will use the same folder.

- [00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=1350) Convert model.

- [00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=1351) Let's see, this time, will we get a crash or not?

- [00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=1355) When you get out of RAM, the pod will crash.

- [00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=1358) Okay, let's see what is happening.

- [00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=1360) Yes, killed again.

- [00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=1361) So, we were out of RAM one more time.

- [00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=1365) Therefore, remember to get more RAM when you are selecting your pod.

- [00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=1369) But this is the way to do it.

- [00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=1372) So, let me demonstrate it with a 1.5 based model.

- [00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=1376) For example, let's try this model.

- [00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=1379) So, right-click, copy link address.

- [00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=1381) I will do everything the same like this: -o, and what is the name?

- [00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=1386) ToonYou.

- [00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=1387) So, let's say, toon.safetensors.

- [00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=1389) And let's wait for it to download.

- [00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=1392) Okay, it is downloading the model.

- [00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=1394) Okay, the model has been downloaded.

- [00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=1396) Let's refresh.

- [00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=1397) Right-click, copy path.

- [00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=1398) By the way, we need to start the Gradio one more time.

- [00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=1401) So, let's wait, start.

- [00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=1403) Okay, let's open the Gradio.

- [00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=1405) Right-click, copy path, put the checkpoint path, and the output folder.

- [00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=1411) Convert model.

- [00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=1412) This time I didn't activate SDXL, so I think it should have sufficient RAM.

- [00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=1417) Okay, it is downloading the necessary model binary file, and it is done.

- [00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=1423) You see, model converted and saved.

- [00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=1425) Now, let's give this as a custom model path, a man, nothing else.

- [00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=1430) Let's load our image like this.

- [00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=1433) Wait until the image is loaded.

- [00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=1435) This is the SD 1.5 model.

- [00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=1437) Okay, image loaded, generate, and just wait.

- [00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=1441) It's loading everything, generating the image, and we got the image like this.

- [00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=1446) You see.

- [00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=1447) Toonified the rock, as you are seeing right now.

- [00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=1450) So, this is how you use the face transfer application that I have developed on RunPod.

- [00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=1457) Now, it is time to use this on a Kaggle notebook, on a free Kaggle notebook.

- [00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=1461) Let's return back to our instructions.

- [00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=1464) First, you need to register a Kaggle account and verify your phone number to be able to

- [00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=1468) use GPUs there.

- [00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=1470) So, let's create a notebook.

- [00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=1471) New notebook.

- [00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=1472) Make sure that you have selected an accelerator.

- [00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=1474) Select the GPU.

- [00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=1476) I will use this GPU.

- [00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=1477) This one is faster than the GPU P100.

- [00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=1480) P100 has more VRAM.

- [00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=1482) Okay, make sure that the internet is on.

- [00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=1484) You can also set persistence, which I don't use because it is making it load slower.

- [00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=1490) Then, click file and import notebook.

- [00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=1493) Click browse files.

- [00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=1494) Go back to our downloads inside here.

- [00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=1498) Upload the Kaggle notebook file.

- [00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=1501) Click import.

- [00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=1502) Then, click this x because it is imported.

- [00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=1505) Then, click here and start the session.

- [00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=1508) Wait until you see green here.

- [00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=1510) Click ok when you see this.

- [00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=1512) Still waiting.

- [00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=1513) Okay, now it is green, and we can see which Kaggle device we got.

- [00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=1518) We got this device.

- [00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=1519) We got the GPU, RAM, everything.

- [00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=1522) Then, click this cell and click this play icon and wait until cancel run is gone.

- [00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=1529) So, when you are seeing this cancel run, it is executing the cell.

- [00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=1534) You need to wait until the cell execution has been totally completed, and this cancel

- [00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=1539) run icon has disappeared, or this animated circle has disappeared.

- [00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=1544) While installing, you will also get such messages as like this.

- [00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=1549) Just ignore them.

- [00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=1550) If the notebook gets broken, just message me on Patreon, and hopefully, I will fix it

- [00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=1555) as soon as possible.

- [00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=1556) Okay, the installation has been completed.

- [00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=1558) You see, there is no more cancel run.

- [00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=1561) So, now execute this cell.

- [00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=1563) This cell will download the necessary adapter files into the accurate folders.

- [00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=1568) Okay, the files have been downloaded.

- [00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=1570) On Kaggle, you have to download models onto the Kaggle temporary directory before starting

- [00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=1578) the web UI because when the web UI is running, you won't be able to download new models.

- [00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=1582) So, let's download Toon on Kaggle as well.

- [00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=1586) Right-click, copy link address.

- [00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=1588) So, first, execute this, then copy-paste the link of the model that you want to download,

- [00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=1595) and type its download name like this, and the model has been saved inside here.

- [00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=1601) This is the path that we will give to our web UI to convert the model into diffusers.

- [00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=1605) Now, at this part, first, get your token.

- [00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=1609) If you have not registered your account, click the link here that you will see on your screen.

- [00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=1615) Get your authentication token.

- [00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=1617) After you have copied your authentication token, replace your token here, string, and

- [00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=1623) execute the cell.

- [00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=1626) After cell execution, you will get a link.

- [00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=1628) Click that link.

- [00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=1630) That link will open a page, and it will have a 'visit site' button, but do not click the

- [00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=1636) 'visit site' button yet.

- [00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=1637) Then, what you need to do is run this cell.

- [00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=1641) This cell will start the web UI and wait for the web UI to start.

- [00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=1646) After you see 'running on local URL,' that means the web UI has been started.

- [00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=1650) Now, return back to the 'visit site' and click it.

- [00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=1653) Once you click the 'visit site,' you will get the web UI interface.

- [00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=1657) Then, click the upload face like this, wait for upload, then type the prompt 'A man wearing

- [00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=1665) a costume.'

- [00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=1666) Select the model, any model that you wish, like this one.

- [00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=1671) Generate.

- [00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=1672) Then, the model will be downloaded into the cache folder, into the temporary disk, and

- [00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=1678) Kaggle provides 70 gigabytes of disk space, so we got 50 gigabytes of temporary disk.

- [00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=1684) Also, Kaggle is very fast; it has been downloaded, and we will see the image generation.

- [00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=1689) So now, it is downloading the insightface model.

- [00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=1693) The speed of Kaggle's GPU is also amazing.

- [00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=1697) You see, everything is getting executed, the image is getting generated right now, and

- [00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=1702) we got the image as you are seeing right now.

- [00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=1705) Everything is working okay.

- [00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=1706) Now, let's export that model we downloaded as a diffuser and use it.

- [00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=1712) So, it must be saved in here.

- [00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=1714) I will select it and Ctrl + C and copy.

- [00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=1716) Go back to the Gradio interface enter as a checkpoint file path.

- [00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=1721) Then inside temporary folder I will just type toon like this and click convert.

- [00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=1727) Then, let's follow what is happening here.

- [00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=1729) So, it is downloading the necessary binary file first time.

- [00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=1733) The Kaggle upgraded the RAM they provide for free accounts, and it is amazing, 29 gigabytes,

- [00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=1739) and it is working.

- [00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=1740) It should be almost completed, and it is done.

- [00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=1743) Now, we can use this as a custom model path.

- [00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=1747) Paste it, hit generate, it will load this model this time, as you are seeing right now.

- [00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=1752) And when I click here, you see now we are using 32 gigabytes of disk space, but it is

- [00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=1756) being used on temporary storage.

- [00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=1758) Okay, the image has been generated with this Toonify model, and it is looking pretty good.

- [00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=1763) The images, by default, will be saved inside the working directory inside outputs.

- [00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=1769) But to download all of the generated images, click cancel run, then execute this cell.

- [00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=1776) This cell will zip all the generated images into generated_images.zip file.

- [00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=1780) So, click this cell; you will also get this error, it is fine when the first time you

- [00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=1784) run it, and the generated zip file is here.

- [00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=1788) Click these three dots and click download.

- [00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=1790) This way, you will be able to download all of the generated images.

- [00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=1795) When you open it, you will see the generated images here.

- [00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=1797) This is all about the Kaggle notebook.

- [00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=1799) When you are using this notebook, you will see exactly as here, so you will not have

- [00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjXsJ24kQQg&t=1804) any hard time to execute the cells.
