- [00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=2) hello dear students welcome to the lecture 13 of response web design

- [00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=5) lecture 13 of response web design with s.net 5 and mvc pattern and

- [00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=7) with s.net 5 and mvc pattern and bootstrap 5.

- [00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=9) bootstrap 5. okay so today we will

- [00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=13) okay so today we will study the http context

- [00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=16) study the http context uh we are continuing our uh tutorial set

- [00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=20) uh we are continuing our uh tutorial set i will start with uh cloning our

- [00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=22) i will start with uh cloning our repository as

- [00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=24) repository as usual

- [00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=30) all right so let's uh clone the last lectures

- [00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=41) okay meanwhile it is getting opened let's read so http context okay

- [00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=53) back in the old days where php and asp ruled the world

- [00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=54) ruled the world dealing with stuff like the query string

- [00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=56) dealing with stuff like the query string happened all the time

- [00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=58) happened all the time you would constantly take input from the

- [00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=59) you would constantly take input from the url through the query string

- [00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=61) url through the query string and return content based on it a lot of

- [00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=65) and return content based on it a lot of this work has been abstracted by the

- [00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=66) this work has been abstracted by the asp.net mvc

- [00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=68) asp.net mvc framework for instance parameters from

- [00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=70) framework for instance parameters from the query string are automatically

- [00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=72) the query string are automatically turned into type safe parameters on your

- [00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=74) turned into type safe parameters on your controller actions and information

- [00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=76) controller actions and information posted back through forms can be

- [00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=77) posted back through forms can be automatically turned into model objects

- [00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=80) automatically turned into model objects we are already doing that in our models

- [00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=82) we are already doing that in our models we have made

- [00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=84) we have made various examples

- [00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=94) however you will likely soon run into situations where you need to go a bit

- [00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=96) situations where you need to go a bit more low level

- [00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=97) more low level and be closer to the http pipeline

- [00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=100) and be closer to the http pipeline this is relevant whenever you want to

- [00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=102) this is relevant whenever you want to access the query string or form

- [00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=104) access the query string or form information directly

- [00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=105) information directly but also when you need to deal with

- [00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=107) but also when you need to deal with stuff like cookies sessions and response

- [00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=109) stuff like cookies sessions and response headers

- [00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=110) headers so when do we need to get into deeper

- [00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=113) so when do we need to get into deeper when we want to work with cookies

- [00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=115) when we want to work with cookies sessions or response headers

- [00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=121) asp.net mvc makes it easy for you to access

- [00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=122) access all http related functionality by

- [00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=125) all http related functionality by gathering it all in the http context

- [00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=127) gathering it all in the http context class

- [00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=128) class actually we have also worked with that i

- [00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=131) actually we have also worked with that i believe

- [00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=132) believe in one of our lectures

- [00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=148) okay okay so we have worked with that in our global uh error

- [00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=152) in our global uh error logging and yeah you already have an

- [00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=156) logging and yeah you already have an idea

- [00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=177) accessing the http context the http context class can be accessed

- [00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=179) the http context class can be accessed from all of your controllers

- [00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=182) from all of your controllers for convenience you can access http

- [00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=184) for convenience you can access http context from a property found on your

- [00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=186) context from a property found on your controllers called

- [00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=187) controllers called http context for even greater

- [00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=191) http context for even greater convenience

- [00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=191) convenience some of the properties found on the http

- [00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=194) some of the properties found on the http context class

- [00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=195) context class is also exposed as properties on the

- [00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=197) is also exposed as properties on the controller eg the request property

- [00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=200) controller eg the request property accessing the http context from anywhere

- [00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=203) accessing the http context from anywhere else than in your controllers

- [00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=205) else than in your controllers is not generally recommended so we

- [00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=207) is not generally recommended so we should access

- [00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=208) should access http contacts from our controllers only

- [00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=212) http contacts from our controllers only we can also access from other classes

- [00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=215) we can also access from other classes but it is not recommended and we are

- [00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=218) but it is not recommended and we are already doing that

- [00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=219) already doing that in our global methods class actually

- [00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=224) in our global methods class actually in our project

- [00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=230) it was easy to accomplish in earlier versions of the asp.net mvc framework

- [00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=233) versions of the asp.net mvc framework using the http context current property

- [00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=237) using the http context current property but it was removed in asp.net core

- [00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=239) but it was removed in asp.net core because it basically violates some of

- [00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=241) because it basically violates some of the core principles of the mvc

- [00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=243) the core principles of the mvc architecture

- [00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=245) architecture however if you really need to do it eg

- [00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=247) however if you really need to do it eg to support legacy code

- [00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=249) to support legacy code there are ways around it i suggest that

- [00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=250) there are ways around it i suggest that you have a look at this stack overflow

- [00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=252) you have a look at this stack overflow thread for more information

- [00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=254) thread for more information for example let's check this thread

- [00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=262) okay so it is how to get ac context current in asu.net core

- [00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=265) current in asu.net core and it is not that much easy right now

- [00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=268) and it is not that much easy right now so

- [00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=282) okay there are a lot of things if if you ever need that

- [00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=283) ever need that then you need to work for that

- [00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=290) http context structure there's a lot of properties and methods

- [00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=292) there's a lot of properties and methods relating to the http pipeline

- [00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=295) relating to the http pipeline so for convenience the members of the

- [00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=297) so for convenience the members of the http context class has been split into

- [00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=299) http context class has been split into several objects

- [00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=300) several objects which you can access as properties on

- [00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=302) which you can access as properties on the class

- [00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=303) the class here's a list of the ones you'll likely

- [00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=305) here's a list of the ones you'll likely be using the most

- [00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=307) be using the most http context request all members related

- [00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=311) http context request all members related to the current request

- [00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=312) to the current request eg the query string forms and so on

- [00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=316) eg the query string forms and so on http context response all members

- [00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=319) http context response all members related to the response about to be

- [00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=320) related to the response about to be delivered

- [00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=321) delivered eg cookies and response headers

- [00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=340) potentially authenticated user in the upcoming articles we'll dig

- [00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=342) in the upcoming articles we'll dig deeper into each of these objects

- [00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=344) deeper into each of these objects and talk about the most important

- [00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=346) and talk about the most important functionality found in them

- [00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=348) functionality found in them summary the context class allows you to

- [00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=353) summary the context class allows you to get a lot closer to the http pipeline

- [00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=356) get a lot closer to the http pipeline and deal with more low-level stuff

- [00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=357) and deal with more low-level stuff yourself eg the query string in cookies

- [00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=360) yourself eg the query string in cookies okay so let's start taking our notes

- [00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=364) okay so let's start taking our notes for lecture 13.

- [00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=389) okay what is http context why do we

- [00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=397) neither and how do we use http context class

- [00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=415) query string get data one of the most common ways of taking input from the

- [00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=417) common ways of taking input from the user

- [00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=418) user in a web application is through the

- [00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=420) in a web application is through the query string

- [00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=421) query string in older technologies like php and asp

- [00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=424) in older technologies like php and asp classic

- [00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=425) classic you would deal directly with the query

- [00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=427) you would deal directly with the query string but as mentioned previously

- [00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=429) string but as mentioned previously asp.net mvc has abstracted most query

- [00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=432) asp.net mvc has abstracted most query string handling into parameters for your

- [00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=434) string handling into parameters for your controller actions

- [00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=436) controller actions however in some situations it will still

- [00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=438) however in some situations it will still be relevant to read directly from the

- [00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=440) be relevant to read directly from the query string

- [00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=441) query string and fortunately for us it's still very

- [00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=443) and fortunately for us it's still very easy to do an asp.net mvc

- [00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=447) easy to do an asp.net mvc what is the query string urls are made

- [00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=451) what is the query string urls are made up of several parts

- [00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=452) up of several parts like protocol hostname path and so on

- [00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=455) like protocol hostname path and so on the query string is the part of the url

- [00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=458) the query string is the part of the url that comes after a question mark

- [00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=459) that comes after a question mark character

- [00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=461) character so in a url like this this is the basic

- [00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=463) so in a url like this this is the basic url knowledge uh the first

- [00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=466) url knowledge uh the first one starts with a question mark and then

- [00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=469) one starts with a question mark and then for other parameters you use and

- [00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=472) for other parameters you use and and the equal character is a special

- [00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=475) and the equal character is a special character which defines

- [00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=477) character which defines the value of the parameter so the

- [00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=480) the value of the parameter so the parameter here is

- [00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=481) parameter here is oq and the parameter here is q

- [00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=485) oq and the parameter here is q google still uses that for example

- [00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=495) when we open google and type and we see you see it still uses the

- [00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=498) you see it still uses the [Music]

- [00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=500) [Music] basic query ty query methodology

- [00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=505) basic query ty query methodology you see uh query param uh parameter

- [00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=508) you see uh query param uh parameter source value is hp

- [00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=510) source value is hp parameter er which the value is

- [00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=512) parameter er which the value is something like this

- [00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=514) something like this uh parameter is if lc and there's

- [00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=517) uh parameter is if lc and there's other things so on

- [00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=525) everything after the character is considered the query string

- [00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=527) considered the query string in this case there are two parameters

- [00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=529) in this case there are two parameters one called q

- [00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=530) one called q and one called oq they have the values

- [00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=533) and one called oq they have the values test and hello these would be relevant to the

- [00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=536) and hello these would be relevant to the page displayed by the url for instance

- [00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=539) page displayed by the url for instance the queue parameter is likely used to

- [00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=541) the queue parameter is likely used to tell the server what the user just

- [00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=543) tell the server what the user just searched for

- [00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=544) searched for the query string is usually appended as

- [00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=546) the query string is usually appended as the result of the user

- [00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=547) the result of the user clicking on a link or submitting a form

- [00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=550) clicking on a link or submitting a form this allows the same file on your server

- [00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=552) this allows the same file on your server to handle multiple situations it can

- [00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=554) to handle multiple situations it can vary the output returned based on the

- [00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=556) vary the output returned based on the input through the query string

- [00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=559) input through the query string accessing the query string access to the

- [00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=563) accessing the query string access to the query string in asp.net mvc

- [00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=566) query string in asp.net mvc is very simple just use the http context

- [00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=569) is very simple just use the http context class

- [00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=569) class which this entire chapter is about the

- [00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=572) which this entire chapter is about the information about the query string is

- [00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=574) information about the query string is located using one of the following

- [00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=576) located using one of the following properties

- [00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=577) properties http context request dot query string

- [00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=580) http context request dot query string and http context

- [00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=582) and http context request query the difference is that the

- [00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=585) request query the difference is that the query string is basically the raw text

- [00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=587) query string is basically the raw text string

- [00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=587) string while the query property allows you to

- [00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=589) while the query property allows you to easily access keys

- [00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=591) easily access keys and their values we'll use the query

- [00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=593) and their values we'll use the query property in the next examples

- [00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=595) property in the next examples where i'll demonstrate just how easy it

- [00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=597) where i'll demonstrate just how easy it is to work with

- [00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=598) is to work with okay so let's add a new page and also we

- [00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=602) okay so let's add a new page and also we will refresh our memory

- [00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=604) will refresh our memory i am adding the controllers lecture 13.

- [00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=615) okay pictures 13 controllers

- [00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=626) okay it is added here and then let's add a v for lecture 13.

- [00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=633) and i will use the classic approach crisp

- [00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=633) crisp [Music]

- [00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=635) [Music] like this and let's add a weave

- [00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=646) so it will be index.html okay and

- [00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=649) okay and okay so there is currently no model for

- [00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=652) okay so there is currently no model for this

- [00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=653) this however let's also make a model for

- [00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=656) however let's also make a model for lecture 13.

- [00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=668) okay lecture 13 model okay so in the model uh let's define

- [00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=671) okay so in the model uh let's define some properties such

- [00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=673) some properties such as integers okay

- [00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=678) as integers okay car id and

- [00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=682) car id and string car

- [00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=685) string car name okay

- [00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=689) name okay actually let's name these as

- [00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=692) actually let's name these as yeah car is fine okay a

- [00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=695) yeah car is fine okay a simple uh model and this will use that

- [00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=698) simple uh model and this will use that model as

- [00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=701) model as okay model equal to

- [00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=704) okay model equal to hm9 model start

- [00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=707) hm9 model start lecture 13. now i can access

- [00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=711) lecture 13. now i can access the model uh attributes like car

- [00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=714) the model uh attributes like car id or whatever we want also let's

- [00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=717) id or whatever we want also let's start f4

- [00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=735) easy no okay so let's just copy paste from

- [00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=736) from our lecture time

- [00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=744) our lecture time i'm going to remove this so the rods we

- [00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=747) i'm going to remove this so the rods we can use rods

- [00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=748) can use rods or other things

- [00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=760) rose parameters so we will remember that as well so let's add a row for this

- [00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=762) as well so let's add a row for this method

- [00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=773) wrote a group something like lecture 13 index and

- [00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=776) lecture 13 index and a road name

- [00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=778) a road name [Music]

- [00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=785) okay lecture 13 okay that's it and

- [00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=793) those will be lecture 13 then we can define

- [00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=794) define uh parameters to be posted back

- [00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=798) uh parameters to be posted back to the uh controller let's also do that

- [00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=801) to the uh controller let's also do that so which co uh parameters we have

- [00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=805) so which co uh parameters we have defined in the lecture 13 model

- [00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=808) defined in the lecture 13 model car id so there will be car id

- [00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=811) car id so there will be car id case with the road car id

- [00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=815) case with the road car id this way we can post

- [00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=818) this way we can post page with um default buttons but

- [00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=822) page with um default buttons but okay we don't need this actually

- [00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=827) currently we don't need actually the prospect but i'm just adding

- [00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=829) prospect but i'm just adding so we can have some uh

- [00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=833) so we can have some uh force so there is it will automatically

- [00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=836) force so there is it will automatically tell me

- [00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=838) tell me as car id okay so

- [00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=841) as car id okay so let's say enter car id integers

- [00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=846) let's say enter car id integers and then let's add another input

- [00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=856) okay this will be called name okay i am setting default value as no by

- [00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=859) okay i am setting default value as no by the way

- [00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=860) the way actually empty okay enter

- [00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=863) actually empty okay enter car name string

- [00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=866) car name string and sends data

- [00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=870) and sends data base to servers okay

- [00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=874) base to servers okay and inside here

- [00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=878) and inside here now we will get we will read the

- [00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=882) now we will get we will read the posted back parameters such as

- [00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=890) okay so we have our model so let's generate our model

- [00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=898) we can also verify model state let's just first start with a

- [00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=902) let's just first start with a example then we will expand it so here

- [00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=905) example then we will expand it so here here it is checking that request query

- [00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=907) here it is checking that request query name is

- [00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=909) name is empty or not let's make this car name

- [00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=918) so i will check car name if it is not new or empty then we will assign it to

- [00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=921) new or empty then we will assign it to the car name and we will return content

- [00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=924) the car name and we will return content okay we can also

- [00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=927) okay we can also uh so this is the uh http contributors

- [00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=930) uh so this is the uh http contributors query

- [00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=932) query then there is the uh

- [00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=936) then there is the uh query string as well so let's also

- [00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=939) query string as well so let's also return that as well

- [00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=946) how we gonna do that we need new light however when we return content like this

- [00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=949) however when we return content like this it is not working as expected so

- [00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=953) not working as expected so i will modify my my model and return

- [00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=956) i will modify my my model and return that so

- [00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=958) that so let's add a property name as

- [00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=961) let's add a property name as query string and

- [00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=965) query string and let's say http context query string

- [00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=970) let's say http context query string and http context quick

- [00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=973) and http context quick why did i add these two parameters

- [00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=976) why did i add these two parameters because i will print them onto the

- [00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=977) because i will print them onto the screen

- [00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=978) screen so what am i going to do is i will

- [00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=980) so what am i going to do is i will define lecture

- [00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=982) define lecture 13 model okay to be able to use it let's

- [00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=987) 13 model okay to be able to use it let's add using

- [00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=988) add using okay models now it will be available

- [00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=994) okay models now it will be available okay

- [00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=997) okay lecture 13 and my model

- [00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=1002) lecture 13 and my model go to new model

- [00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=1005) go to new model and here i will set parameters

- [00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=1009) and here i will set parameters as my model dots http context

- [00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=1013) as my model dots http context query equal to actually this is request

- [00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=1016) query equal to actually this is request query

- [00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=1018) query so let's rename this as

- [00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=1025) so let's rename this as context request

- [00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=1034) query and request query string okay and in the controller yeah

- [00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=1039) okay and in the controller yeah i will set it

- [00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=1051) okay so this will check the car name i can also set the car name but i am not touching

- [00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=1054) set the car name but i am not touching that right now

- [00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=1055) that right now then let's check question as well

- [00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=1066) so the currency thing is not taking any indexes it is just a just raw query

- [00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=1070) indexes it is just a just raw query and

- [00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=1087) i need to use it like this and then i will assign it like this and

- [00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=1095) create string and we will return our model so we return view

- [00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=1099) our model so we return view and my model that's it

- [00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=1104) and my model that's it okay and on here let's print the

- [00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=1108) okay and on here let's print the values as

- [00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=1168) and by default it will open the lecture 12 because we didn't set the root url as

- [00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=1172) 12 because we didn't set the root url as lecture 13 okay

- [00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=1175) lecture 13 okay but it is fine

- [00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=1191) okay so let's open lecture 13 like this okay it says that it is not found

- [00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=1194) okay it says that it is not found so

- [00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=1201) let's check our controllers we have our road as lecture 13.

- [00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=1211) however it says it is not found let's try as this way

- [00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=1221) okay well lecture 13 has the road name not the

- [00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=1222) not the road itself the road itself is this one

- [00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=1225) road itself the road itself is this one i will just uh confuse so you see uh

- [00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=1229) i will just uh confuse so you see uh i also need to add change the view start

- [00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=1232) i also need to add change the view start by the way

- [00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=1235) by the way because we are telling that it is the

- [00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=1237) because we are telling that it is the beginning of the year start and

- [00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=1239) beginning of the year start and then we need to add some okay

- [00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=1242) then we need to add some okay something like this to see it's better

- [00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=1246) something like this to see it's better which restarts

- [00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=1279) okay so currently we have no clear strings

- [00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=1280) strings let's say let's add something

- [00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=1284) let's say let's add something okay test and

- [00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=1288) okay test and another thing temporary

- [00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=1291) another thing temporary okay so you see the full query string we

- [00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=1295) okay so you see the full query string we are getting is like this this is the raw

- [00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=1297) are getting is like this this is the raw query string

- [00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=1298) query string and from that we can do whatever we want

- [00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=1300) and from that we can do whatever we want and now

- [00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=1301) and now i will also assign the request query so

- [00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=1304) i will also assign the request query so request query is expecting

- [00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=1306) request query is expecting a car name

- [00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=1309) a car name by the way these are i think case

- [00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=1312) by the way these are i think case sensitive

- [00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=1313) sensitive so let's say bmw

- [00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=1316) so let's say bmw this is a brand actually what okay bmw

- [00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=1318) this is a brand actually what okay bmw is working

- [00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=1319) is working what what what happens if i make this

- [00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=1321) what what what happens if i make this lower case or

- [00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=1323) lower case or it is not case and still that's good

- [00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=1326) it is not case and still that's good yeah it's

- [00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=1326) yeah it's working and

- [00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=1329) working and let's see if we can iterate through all

- [00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=1332) let's see if we can iterate through all of the

- [00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=1334) of the requests query i'm going to do that as

- [00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=1337) requests query i'm going to do that as well

- [00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=1339) well so i'm going to change this request for

- [00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=1342) so i'm going to change this request for the intro

- [00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=1345) the intro or let's just make it for each

- [00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=1353) sorry for each request query so the request code has i query

- [00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=1355) so the request code has i query collection it is iteratable

- [00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=1357) collection it is iteratable and so this is key value pair nice that

- [00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=1360) and so this is key value pair nice that is what we would like to have

- [00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=1363) is what we would like to have so let's con append them to do here

- [00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=1367) so let's con append them to do here such as

- [00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=1373) plus equal to item dot key okay so the let's name it and name

- [00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=1377) key okay so the let's name it and name it as

- [00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=1380) it as okay parameters

- [00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=1384) okay parameters name okay

- [00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=1403) as item dot value and then let's add a

- [00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=1408) value and then let's add a new line like this

- [00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=1411) new line like this okay so for each will automatically

- [00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=1414) okay so for each will automatically handle null check

- [00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=1415) handle null check and if it is known it will never get

- [00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=1417) and if it is known it will never get into this for each

- [00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=1419) into this for each okay let's run the application so now we

- [00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=1422) okay let's run the application so now we can print all of the requested

- [00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=1426) can print all of the requested parameters and their values

- [00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=1459) let's take also note 16. request 3d and representing

- [00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=1473) okay index nothing next lecture 30 index

- [00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=1476) lecture 30 index okay there is nothing so far so let's

- [00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=1478) okay there is nothing so far so let's add

- [00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=1479) add this okay parameter name is something

- [00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=1482) this okay parameter name is something parameter values test

- [00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=1484) parameter values test is it true yes by the way you see it is

- [00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=1487) is it true yes by the way you see it is not formatted as html however

- [00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=1490) not formatted as html however uh solving that if you remember

- [00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=1493) uh solving that if you remember let me show you that again so here

- [00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=1496) let me show you that again so here instead of add

- [00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=1498) instead of add this is encoding by default we need to

- [00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=1501) this is encoding by default we need to use html raw okay

- [00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=1505) html raw okay and when i make this this way this will

- [00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=1509) and when i make this this way this will remove encoding as encoding of html

- [00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=1515) remove encoding as encoding of html okay it is not a big command so

- [00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=1520) okay it is not a big command so let's comment it like this and let's

- [00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=1522) let's comment it like this and let's restart

- [00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=1525) restart okay let's read the form post data

- [00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=1527) okay let's read the form post data meanwhile

- [00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=1540) forms post data in the last article we discussed the query string

- [00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=1542) discussed the query string and how you can read parameters through

- [00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=1543) and how you can read parameters through it this will usually happen through a

- [00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=1546) it this will usually happen through a so-called get request

- [00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=1548) so-called get request which will most frequently occur as a

- [00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=1549) which will most frequently occur as a result of the user entering a url in the

- [00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=1552) result of the user entering a url in the browser

- [00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=1552) browser or clicking on a link as an alternative

- [00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=1555) or clicking on a link as an alternative to the get request will find the post

- [00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=1557) to the get request will find the post request

- [00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=1559) request a post request is usually initiated when

- [00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=1561) a post request is usually initiated when the user submits a form

- [00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=1562) the user submits a form like a contact form or a login form

- [00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=1566) like a contact form or a login form unlike a get request where the data is

- [00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=1568) unlike a get request where the data is visible in the url there's no visible

- [00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=1570) visible in the url there's no visible data for the user in a post request

- [00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=1573) data for the user in a post request for that reason you need to use another

- [00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=1575) for that reason you need to use another property on the http context class to

- [00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=1578) property on the http context class to pick up post data

- [00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=1579) pick up post data the form property okay before moving to

- [00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=1582) the form property okay before moving to property

- [00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=1583) property let's test our lecture 13 input

- [00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=1587) let's test our lecture 13 input like this okay now you see they are

- [00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=1590) like this okay now you see they are formatted as html with new line

- [00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=1593) formatted as html with new line and parameter name something parameter

- [00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=1594) and parameter name something parameter value test parameter name another thing

- [00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=1596) value test parameter name another thing parameter by attempt

- [00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=1598) parameter by attempt and i can add as many as parameter i

- [00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=1601) and i can add as many as parameter i want like this

- [00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=1603) want like this you see now the product method name is a

- [00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=1606) you see now the product method name is a let's add another parameter name

- [00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=1608) let's add another parameter name as school include photos for example

- [00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=1612) as school include photos for example you see we are able to iterate through

- [00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=1614) you see we are able to iterate through all of the

- [00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=1616) all of the input parameters and this is the raw

- [00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=1617) input parameters and this is the raw query string so you may want to

- [00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=1620) query string so you may want to log both of them if you want in the

- [00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=1622) log both of them if you want in the database and this is the way

- [00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=1623) database and this is the way to get them alternatively

- [00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=1628) to get them alternatively we can add them to the post

- [00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=1631) we can add them to the post and now that's what we're going to see

- [00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=1640) in asp.net mvc the most common approach to dealing with forms is to bind the

- [00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=1642) to dealing with forms is to bind the form to a model

- [00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=1643) form to a model that means that each field of the form

- [00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=1645) that means that each field of the form is tied to a property on the model

- [00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=1647) is tied to a property on the model allowing the form to read from the model

- [00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=1649) allowing the form to read from the model and also write to it when the form is

- [00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=1651) and also write to it when the form is submitted

- [00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=1653) submitted this is often referred to as model

- [00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=1654) this is often referred to as model binding and we'll discuss it elsewhere

- [00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=1656) binding and we'll discuss it elsewhere in this tutorial

- [00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=1657) in this tutorial but in this article we'll access form

- [00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=1659) but in this article we'll access form data in the old fashioned way

- [00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=1662) data in the old fashioned way okay so let's also note this

- [00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=1683) okay all right so this is traditional

- [00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=1686) all right so this is traditional form and i will also have the model

- [00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=1689) form and i will also have the model binding as well

- [00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=1690) binding as well so in the traditional form i have to

- [00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=1692) so in the traditional form i have to type the full path

- [00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=1694) type the full path like this lecture 13 index

- [00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=1699) like this lecture 13 index and let's uh have both of them uh in the

- [00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=1702) and let's uh have both of them uh in the first form we will have model binding as

- [00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=1705) first form we will have model binding as you see car

- [00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=1705) you see car id card name and

- [00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=1708) id card name and something to prospect and in the

- [00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=1711) something to prospect and in the traditional form we will have

- [00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=1714) traditional form we will have okay for

- [00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=1722) car id and id will be car id like this and the name will be car id then we will

- [00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=1724) and the name will be car id then we will have car name

- [00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=1725) have car name so you see it is using labeled force and

- [00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=1728) so you see it is using labeled force and we could use

- [00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=1730) we could use that as

- [00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=1739) okay how was its label put label off

- [00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=1750) i think it was with ace for labor force i don't remember

- [00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=1751) i don't remember exactly how was it okay let's try it

- [00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=1755) exactly how was it okay let's try it like this

- [00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=1756) like this and find name like this

- [00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=1760) and find name like this we can also define how they will be

- [00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=1762) we can also define how they will be visible

- [00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=1763) visible in our model let's also make that so we

- [00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=1765) in our model let's also make that so we will remember that as well

- [00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=1769) will remember that as well so here we will add a parameter

- [00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=1772) so here we will add a parameter as it was v

- [00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=1780) or was it

- [00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=1790) okay let's check from our previous models

- [00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=1791) models and display okay you see sometimes you

- [00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=1794) and display okay you see sometimes you may forget it

- [00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=1795) may forget it like me so it's this will be for the

- [00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=1798) like me so it's this will be for the display to be available i need to add

- [00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=1801) display to be available i need to add um data annotations but i'm going to add

- [00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=1805) um data annotations but i'm going to add this into the vivi import

- [00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=1807) this into the vivi import so i won't be needed to that i want we

- [00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=1809) so i won't be needed to that i want we need to add that to every page

- [00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=1812) need to add that to every page so let's get back into our view import

- [00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=1815) so let's get back into our view import which is here and i am adding

- [00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=1820) is here and i am adding it as using like this

- [00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=1824) it as using like this we don't need that semicolon and now

- [00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=1828) we don't need that semicolon and now it will automatically work is false

- [00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=1837) oh the viewing port only imported to the vx not

- [00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=1838) vx not the yeah not the controllers

- [00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=1842) the yeah not the controllers so for controls i need to edit here okay

- [00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=1845) so for controls i need to edit here okay so the display name

- [00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=1846) so the display name let's say car id

- [00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=1850) let's say car id so it will be better formatted and

- [00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=1854) so it will be better formatted and okay car name

- [00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=1863) all right and on our index cshtml okay so these two are equal

- [00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=1874) id you see i have to type extra code and if if i were using that model in

- [00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=1877) if if i were using that model in multiple waves i would be needed to

- [00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=1879) multiple waves i would be needed to change it

- [00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=1880) change it in everywhere if i am using the

- [00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=1883) in everywhere if i am using the legacy way

- [00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=1892) so for the car name it will be uh by the way this will be type number and

- [00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=1894) by the way this will be type number and this will be text

- [00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=1901) id will be like this for column name so this is checking the id of the

- [00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=1903) so this is checking the id of the element not the name

- [00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=1905) element not the name and then submit okay so let's also name

- [00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=1909) and then submit okay so let's also name this

- [00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=1911) this server with model binding

- [00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=1920) and send data back to server with legacy

- [00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=1927) all right they are totally equal right now

- [00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=1929) now one of them is uh legacy way and the

- [00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=1934) one of them is uh legacy way and the other one is the

- [00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=1935) other one is the modern way

- [00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=1962) okay let's open lectures index let's edit the bookmark

- [00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=1965) index let's edit the bookmark okay so we have now car id you see they

- [00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=1969) okay so we have now car id you see they are taking

- [00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=1969) are taking entire space as an input right now

- [00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=1973) entire space as an input right now do you know why do you remember why

- [00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=1976) do you know why do you remember why because in the previous lecture we have

- [00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=1978) because in the previous lecture we have imported

- [00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=1981) imported um actually we have started we've

- [00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=1985) um actually we have started we've started

- [00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=1986) started bootstrap therefore this is the uh

- [00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=1990) bootstrap therefore this is the uh [Music]

- [00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=1991) [Music] this is the styling of bootstrap when i

- [00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=1995) this is the styling of bootstrap when i inspect it i will see it

- [00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=1997) inspect it i will see it so here it has a form control class

- [00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=2000) so here it has a form control class this is the default class that is dotted

- [00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=2004) this is the default class that is dotted mvc adds

- [00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=2005) mvc adds and this class is getting from from css

- [00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=2010) and this class is getting from from css and which is getting from

- [00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=2018) i think bootstrap yeah probably this is getting

- [00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=2022) bootstrap yeah probably this is getting from bootstrap

- [00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=2023) from bootstrap and here they are like regular

- [00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=2027) and here they are like regular way okay and you see this is also

- [00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=2031) way okay and you see this is also have increment or decrements

- [00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=2035) have increment or decrements okay this is the new way and this is the

- [00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=2038) okay this is the new way and this is the older way

- [00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=2040) older way now all right let's get

- [00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=2043) now all right let's get back into our controller to test them

- [00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=2054) first we need to add a post method action to handle it

- [00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=2058) method action to handle it okay

- [00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=2061) okay currently it wouldn't work so let's add

- [00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=2065) currently it wouldn't work so let's add our

- [00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=2066) our action as update this will be our form

- [00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=2071) action as update this will be our form and the name will be lecture

- [00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=2075) and the name will be lecture 13 update and i will call it as

- [00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=2079) 13 update and i will call it as update so update will take model as an

- [00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=2083) update so update will take model as an input

- [00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=2084) input it will be lecture 13 model

- [00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=2087) it will be lecture 13 model my model okay

- [00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=2091) my model okay first we will verify if the model is

- [00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=2093) first we will verify if the model is valid or not

- [00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=2095) valid or not if model state is

- [00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=2098) if model state is valid if it is not valid we will just

- [00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=2103) valid if it is not valid we will just return and we can just return we will

- [00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=2107) return and we can just return we will return

- [00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=2109) return if uh with

- [00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=2112) if uh with we shouldn't also return with my model i

- [00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=2114) we shouldn't also return with my model i think

- [00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=2117) think so we will return with nev lecture

- [00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=2121) so we will return with nev lecture 13 okay

- [00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=2124) 13 okay so we will return the new model if it is

- [00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=2126) so we will return the new model if it is not valid

- [00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=2128) not valid then if it is valid uh we will just

- [00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=2131) then if it is valid uh we will just return

- [00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=2131) return our model okay let's try it

- [00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=2136) our model okay let's try it oh by the way we didn't modify the

- [00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=2137) oh by the way we didn't modify the prospect so the prospect will be let's

- [00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=2144) prospect so the prospect will be let's stop the application

- [00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=2153) okay the prospect will be okay update so this will be update and

- [00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=2158) okay update so this will be update and the other one will take the name so the

- [00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=2160) the other one will take the name so the name will be

- [00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=2161) name will be this okay let's run the application

- [00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=2188) all right let's open page let's check the forms

- [00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=2196) okay for method post action is working and there is no validate and here's

- [00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=2201) and there is no validate and here's it is just a regular form okay so let's

- [00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=2204) it is just a regular form okay so let's prospect something as

- [00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=2205) prospect something as this and this we have no validation by

- [00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=2208) this and this we have no validation by the way

- [00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=2209) the way i will just type bme and oh

- [00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=2212) i will just type bme and oh we have a problem

- [00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=2215) we have a problem so what is the problem in our controller

- [00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=2219) so what is the problem in our controller post page

- [00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=2226) let's just repost and here okay there's my model okay there's car

- [00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=2229) okay there's my model okay there's car id card name

- [00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=2231) id card name yeah the other ones are new

- [00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=2235) yeah the other ones are new then i can return model okay so

- [00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=2238) then i can return model okay so our global handler is capturing the

- [00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=2241) our global handler is capturing the error let's check

- [00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=2241) error let's check the error what is it is so the error is

- [00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=2247) the error what is it is so the error is the view update was not found

- [00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=2256) so this is a simple issue when i return with it is by default

- [00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=2259) when i return with it is by default returning to update v

- [00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=2261) returning to update v okay this however i have to return

- [00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=2266) okay this however i have to return the index view and the index view path

- [00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=2269) the index view and the index view path is this okay i think

- [00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=2273) this okay i think since we are under the lecture 13

- [00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=2276) since we are under the lecture 13 controller then it should just

- [00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=2299) standard pattern right now okay okay it is working however we are

- [00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=2303) okay okay it is working however we are not able to see that

- [00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=2304) not able to see that because we are not printing yet so

- [00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=2308) because we are not printing yet so in our index i'm going to print them

- [00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=2311) in our index i'm going to print them like these two

- [00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=2323) and the second one will be called name by default they are null

- [00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=2325) by default they are null therefore it won't print anything into

- [00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=2327) therefore it won't print anything into the screen

- [00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=2329) the screen let's restart

- [00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=2355) okay something like this and this okay so now the url has changed to

- [00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=2358) okay so now the url has changed to update

- [00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=2360) update uh because we did the prospect but now

- [00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=2362) uh because we did the prospect but now i'm able to see the post packet data

- [00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=2365) i'm able to see the post packet data now let's add something like this so it

- [00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=2367) now let's add something like this so it will change

- [00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=2368) will change again yes prospect is working for

- [00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=2372) again yes prospect is working for both legacy and

- [00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=2382) nif version modern version let's continue the

- [00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=2384) modern version let's continue the article just a basic

- [00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=2385) article just a basic html form notice how i set the method

- [00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=2389) html form notice how i set the method attribute to post form support the get

- [00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=2391) attribute to post form support the get method as well

- [00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=2392) method as well but it's almost always better to use the

- [00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=2394) but it's almost always better to use the post method when dealing with forms

- [00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=2397) post method when dealing with forms my controller could then look like this

- [00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=2404) okay and there is nothing else okay so

- [00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=2412) in the uh legacy bay i will change model binding okay since i have used

- [00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=2416) model binding okay since i have used the same name i was able to use model

- [00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=2418) the same name i was able to use model binding

- [00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=2419) binding this is the model binding methodology

- [00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=2427) modern model binding method now i'm going to write another version

- [00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=2432) now i'm going to write another version update legacy

- [00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=2440) okay i don't need name for this one and these methods will will not take

- [00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=2444) and these methods will will not take model and what we are going to do is we

- [00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=2447) model and what we are going to do is we are going to use the http request for

- [00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=2452) are going to use the http request for ok so

- [00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=2460) to be able to use it i need to also make a null change

- [00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=2462) a null change if is known or empty oh or we can just

- [00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=2467) if is known or empty oh or we can just directly i think

- [00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=2469) directly i think uh i sign it because it was this will be

- [00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=2472) uh i sign it because it was this will be always posted back

- [00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=2473) always posted back so first i need to generate an instance

- [00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=2476) so first i need to generate an instance of my nature 13 model

- [00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=2480) of my nature 13 model my model

- [00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=2491) equal to near my new lecture 13 and when composing it let's set the

- [00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=2493) and when composing it let's set the parameters as

- [00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=2495) parameters as car name and car

- [00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=2498) car name and car id equal to by the way when i use these

- [00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=2502) id equal to by the way when i use these methods i am

- [00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=2503) methods i am not able to use

- [00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=2507) not able to use any validation

- [00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=2514) and also you see i am not able to directly convert it to

- [00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=2515) directly convert it to car id so i will remove this

- [00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=2520) car id so i will remove this and

- [00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=2523) and i think this would by default get

- [00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=2537) try parse so simple request form

- [00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=2550) car name and art will be my model dot co id okay

- [00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=2560) oh so i have to provide [Music]

- [00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=2562) [Music] art

- [00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=2564) art or left out

- [00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=2574) oh i'm sorry about that i have read it incorrectly

- [00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=2575) incorrectly so it says that a property or indexer

- [00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=2578) so it says that a property or indexer may not

- [00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=2578) may not access it pass it as an out or left

- [00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=2580) access it pass it as an out or left parameter

- [00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=2581) parameter so can i fix this i think i can

- [00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=2585) so can i fix this i think i can instead of making this property i'm

- [00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=2587) instead of making this property i'm going to make this

- [00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=2591) going to make this a field however that may break

- [00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=2595) a field however that may break my model binding so i'm not sure what

- [00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=2597) my model binding so i'm not sure what will happen

- [00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=2613) okay now it is working so let's try you see currently i am not able to do

- [00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=2615) you see currently i am not able to do any verification i also need to convert

- [00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=2620) any verification i also need to convert integer myself oh we haven't changed the

- [00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=2624) integer myself oh we haven't changed the postback

- [00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=2635) let me fix it quickly so

- [00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=2691) all right so what is hdb context request form and how to utilize it for legacy

- [00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=2694) form and how to utilize it for legacy way of posting database

- [00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=2695) way of posting database server okay and here's

- [00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=2699) server okay and here's now let's test it out

- [00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=2702) now let's test it out okay car id didn't work

- [00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=2716) name we can also iterate and write the form

- [00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=2720) iterate and write the form properties so let's also iterate and

- [00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=2723) properties so let's also iterate and type them to the screen as well

- [00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=2727) type them to the screen as well okay to be able to type them to the

- [00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=2730) okay to be able to type them to the screen let's get back into our

- [00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=2731) screen let's get back into our model which is here and let's add a

- [00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=2734) model which is here and let's add a property as

- [00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=2736) property as string

- [00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=2746) okay form properties okay and what we are going to do is

- [00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=2749) okay and what we are going to do is simply

- [00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=2750) simply something like this

- [00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=2760) http conf form request form okay

- [00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=2764) request form okay and now um we will use

- [00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=2767) and now um we will use form properties and

- [00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=2771) form properties and it has key and value yeah

- [00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=2774) it has key and value yeah and we also need to print that to the

- [00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=2777) and we also need to print that to the index

- [00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=2778) index page so let's

- [00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=2781) page so let's print it to

- [00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=2789) for properties by the way this will be only printed when we use the legacy

- [00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=2791) only printed when we use the legacy codes

- [00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=2792) codes currently because we didn't edit to the

- [00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=2796) currently because we didn't edit to the model binding

- [00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=2807) okay let's continue reading notice how i can access the values of the form fields

- [00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=2810) can access the values of the form fields by referencing their names

- [00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=2811) by referencing their names username and user age as defined in the

- [00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=2813) username and user age as defined in the name property of the form fields

- [00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=2815) name property of the form fields in the form collection so the important

- [00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=2818) in the form collection so the important thing is their name the id is

- [00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=2822) is their name the id is for client site and for server side it

- [00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=2825) for client site and for server side it is taking the name

- [00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=2826) is taking the name at the postback okay okay

- [00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=2830) at the postback okay okay um so let's just pause

- [00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=2834) um so let's just pause okay so the parameter name card id

- [00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=2836) okay so the parameter name card id parameter value is and

- [00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=2838) parameter value is and yeah it is working as expected

- [00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=2849) yeah let's continue cookies cookies are really important

- [00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=2864) cookies http the protocol that takes care of the

- [00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=2865) the protocol that takes care of the communication between a server

- [00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=2867) communication between a server and a client on the web is known as a

- [00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=2869) and a client on the web is known as a stateless protocol

- [00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=2871) stateless protocol in other words if a user requests two

- [00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=2874) in other words if a user requests two pages on a server

- [00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=2875) pages on a server no information will be shared between

- [00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=2877) no information will be shared between these two requests automatically

- [00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=2879) these two requests automatically instead a developer will have to rely on

- [00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=2882) instead a developer will have to rely on something called cookies

- [00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=2883) something called cookies or sessions more on those later to share

- [00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=2885) or sessions more on those later to share information between the requests

- [00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=2888) information between the requests this is extremely useful in a lot of

- [00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=2890) this is extremely useful in a lot of situations eg

- [00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=2891) situations eg to keep a user logged in between several

- [00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=2893) to keep a user logged in between several requests etc

- [00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=2897) requests etc pretty much all server-side technologies

- [00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=2899) pretty much all server-side technologies have built-in support for handling

- [00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=2900) have built-in support for handling cookies and of course the asp.net mvc

- [00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=2904) cookies and of course the asp.net mvc framework does as well in fact dealing

- [00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=2907) framework does as well in fact dealing with cookies is pretty easy

- [00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=2909) with cookies is pretty easy thanks to the functionality found on the

- [00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=2910) thanks to the functionality found on the http context class

- [00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=2913) http context class in this article you'll learn how to set

- [00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=2915) in this article you'll learn how to set a cookie and then read it again

- [00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=2917) a cookie and then read it again afterwards

- [00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=2918) afterwards so that you will be able to share

- [00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=2919) so that you will be able to share information about a specific visitor

- [00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=2921) information about a specific visitor between his slashers requests

- [00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=2924) between his slashers requests what is a cookie a cookie is basically a

- [00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=2927) what is a cookie a cookie is basically a physical

- [00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=2928) physical plain text file stored by the client

- [00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=2930) plain text file stored by the client usually a browser

- [00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=2931) usually a browser tied to a specific website the client

- [00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=2934) tied to a specific website the client will then allow this specific website to

- [00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=2936) will then allow this specific website to read the information stored in this file

- [00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=2938) read the information stored in this file on subsequent requests

- [00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=2940) on subsequent requests basically allowing the server or even

- [00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=2942) basically allowing the server or even the client itself

- [00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=2943) the client itself to store information for later use okay

- [00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=2946) to store information for later use okay for example

- [00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=2947) for example uh when we work with asp.net it is it

- [00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=2950) uh when we work with asp.net it is it sets

- [00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=2950) sets uh as a.net cookie and that is how

- [00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=2955) uh as a.net cookie and that is how server knows that i am requesting a page

- [00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=2960) server knows that i am requesting a page okay so in here i think you can see the

- [00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=2963) okay so in here i think you can see the cookies

- [00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=2965) cookies context okay bundles

- [00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=2969) context okay bundles okay here cookies and for this page

- [00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=2974) okay here cookies and for this page no no that's not a cookies

- [00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=2985) okay maybe we can see from the network okay so in the network headers you see

- [00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=2988) okay so in the network headers you see there is request and there's cookies

- [00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=2990) there is request and there's cookies okay so

- [00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=2993) okay so let me show you okay it's without a

- [00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=2996) let me show you okay it's without a station id so this cookie

- [00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=2998) station id so this cookie is sent back to the server and

- [00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3001) is sent back to the server and with this one it knows that i am

- [00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3005) with this one it knows that i am requesting uh

- [00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3013) i'm requesting the page this is the way that a server knows who is

- [00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3017) that a server knows who is requesting or not and

- [00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3021) requesting or not and this is how much cookies are useful

- [00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3025) this is how much cookies are useful okay setting and reading cookies

- [00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3038) setting and reading cookies setting a cookie and reading it again

- [00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3039) cookie and reading it again later on with asp.net mvc is very

- [00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3043) later on with asp.net mvc is very very easy here's how you can send a

- [00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3045) very easy here's how you can send a cookie to the client

- [00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3046) cookie to the client in its most basic form http context

- [00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3051) in its most basic form http context response cookies append user underscore

- [00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3054) response cookies append user underscore id 1. notice how i use the response

- [00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3058) 1. notice how i use the response property on the http context class

- [00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3061) property on the http context class where i can access the cookies property

- [00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3064) where i can access the cookies property using the append

- [00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3065) using the append method i can add a cookie to the output

- [00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3067) method i can add a cookie to the output by supplying a name

- [00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3068) by supplying a name and a value for it the name user

- [00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3071) and a value for it the name user underscore id

- [00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3072) underscore id is what we'll use later on to get the

- [00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3074) is what we'll use later on to get the value one back

- [00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3076) value one back and getting the actual value back is

- [00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3078) and getting the actual value back is just as easy

- [00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3079) just as easy okay one thing that you need to be aware

- [00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3082) okay one thing that you need to be aware of that

- [00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3083) of that uh the client can can change and modify

- [00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3087) uh the client can can change and modify cookie as they wish

- [00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3088) cookie as they wish okay so for this

- [00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3091) okay so for this you have to be very careful

- [00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3095) you have to be very careful for example let's set a cookie and

- [00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3103) okay https cookies okay user id1 and let's see that cookie in the

- [00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3106) and let's see that cookie in the postback event

- [00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3108) postback event like this okay

- [00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3113) like this okay so when we run our page we will see that

- [00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3115) so when we run our page we will see that we have a cookie now

- [00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3145) okay and now let's inspect our network

- [00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3152) okay so here from the headers uh we have response address which is

- [00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3154) uh we have response address which is coming from the server

- [00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3157) coming from the server and we have request headers

- [00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3161) and we have request headers and is my cookie here no

- [00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3166) and is my cookie here no it is not set yet i think

- [00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3181) let's continue notice how i now use the request

- [00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3183) notice how i now use the request property instead of the response

- [00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3184) property instead of the response when reading the value back the reason

- [00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3186) when reading the value back the reason is that setting a cookie is done by

- [00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3188) is that setting a cookie is done by adding information to the response sent

- [00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3190) adding information to the response sent to the client

- [00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3191) to the client while reading it means that you are

- [00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3192) while reading it means that you are pulling information from the request

- [00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3194) pulling information from the request made by the client

- [00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3195) made by the client a normal browser will automatically send

- [00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3197) a normal browser will automatically send all relevant cookies with each request

- [00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3201) all relevant cookies with each request so now that you know how to write and

- [00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3202) so now that you know how to write and read cookie information

- [00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3204) read cookie information let's combine that into a very simple

- [00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3206) let's combine that into a very simple example where we add a piece of

- [00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3207) example where we add a piece of information as a cookie if it's not

- [00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3209) information as a cookie if it's not already present this will be a great way

- [00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3211) already present this will be a great way to know if a user has visited the page

- [00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3213) to know if a user has visited the page before or not

- [00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3214) before or not okay so let's copy and paste this

- [00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3219) okay so let's copy and paste this and i will add it to the lecture

- [00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3223) and i will add it to the lecture oh i know why it was not set because we

- [00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3225) oh i know why it was not set because we have used update method for setting

- [00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3229) have used update method for setting i will just remove this and i will put

- [00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3232) i will just remove this and i will put my cookie

- [00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3233) my cookie code into the index like this

- [00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3238) code into the index like this okay so it will check uh first cookie

- [00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3242) okay so it will check uh first cookie and if it contains it with that first

- [00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3244) and if it contains it with that first cookie

- [00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3246) cookie and monitor

- [00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3249) and monitor okay but we can do that okay no need

- [00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3253) okay but we can do that okay no need actually

- [00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3254) actually and if it is not then we will tell that

- [00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3257) and if it is not then we will tell that it is

- [00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3257) it is not the first time oh we can tell the

- [00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3261) not the first time oh we can tell the first time

- [00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3262) first time uh visiting date so let's add a

- [00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3266) uh visiting date so let's add a property to our model here

- [00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3275) date time first time visit date okay

- [00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3278) visit date okay and okay from my model

- [00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3289) like this all right and let's also display that on the next

- [00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3292) and let's also display that on the next page

- [00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3307) by the way i can also uh give this a display name and use it

- [00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3310) uh give this a display name and use it here let me also show you that

- [00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3313) here let me also show you that so for this i'm going to have a display

- [00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3315) so for this i'm going to have a display name

- [00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3317) name and it will be first

- [00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3320) and it will be first time visiting date

- [00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3323) time visiting date like this this would be better approach

- [00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3326) like this this would be better approach instead of typing it like this

- [00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3328) instead of typing it like this so i'm going to add input

- [00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3338) not input label is before uh first time visit date

- [00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3341) uh first time visit date like this okay

- [00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3345) like this okay and let's run the application to see

- [00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3347) and let's run the application to see what kind of output we are going to get

- [00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3372) okay so the first time visiting date is not set

- [00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3373) not set at the beginning however now it should

- [00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3375) at the beginning however now it should be set

- [00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3376) be set since we have visited so let's check our

- [00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3381) since we have visited so let's check our [Music]

- [00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3401) where do we see the cookies memory no okay application cookies

- [00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3405) no okay application cookies yes first request and it is set

- [00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3408) yes first request and it is set as like this you see

- [00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3412) as like this you see and let's refresh the page to see

- [00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3418) and let's refresh the page to see whether we will be able to get it read

- [00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3421) whether we will be able to get it read it back or not

- [00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3423) it back or not yes now we are able to see the first

- [00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3425) yes now we are able to see the first time with it you see the date is

- [00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3427) time with it you see the date is different and when i refresh it it won't

- [00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3429) different and when i refresh it it won't change

- [00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3429) change because this is the first time visiting

- [00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3431) because this is the first time visiting date which we are holding in cookie

- [00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3434) date which we are holding in cookie however i can uh remove that cookie

- [00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3437) however i can uh remove that cookie and let me delete it and now when i

- [00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3440) and let me delete it and now when i refresh it will reset

- [00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3442) refresh it will reset you will see in a moment okay it is

- [00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3445) you will see in a moment okay it is reset and when i refresh you see now

- [00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3447) reset and when i refresh you see now it is reset okay

- [00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3450) it is reset okay so this is how we can set and read

- [00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3471) okay and in the code behind in the controllers okay so you see we

- [00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3474) in the controllers okay so you see we are doing

- [00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3475) are doing a check key check and it returns bool

- [00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3480) a check key check and it returns bool so it may not handle null values

- [00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3489) i'm not sure okay let's try if it if it is able to

- [00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3493) okay let's try if it if it is able to [Music]

- [00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3496) [Music] under non-existing keys or not

- [00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3503) under non-existing keys or not okay version two okay this doesn't exist

- [00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3506) okay version two okay this doesn't exist and i won't repeat row

- [00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3508) and i won't repeat row if it will drop an error or it will just

- [00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3512) if it will drop an error or it will just uh return null

- [00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3517) uh return null when you are coding something that you

- [00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3519) when you are coding something that you have to

- [00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3521) have to be sure that you are covering unexpected

- [00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3524) be sure that you are covering unexpected cases

- [00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3525) cases um unexpected events

- [00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3531) um unexpected events okay let's refresh okay it's just

- [00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3534) okay let's refresh okay it's just returning no so this is

- [00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3536) returning no so this is uh handling

- [00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3539) uh handling null cases as well

- [00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3546) okay and then let's continue reading our controller

- [00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3550) let's continue reading our controller action now produces response based on

- [00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3552) action now produces response based on whether the visitor has visited the page

- [00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3554) whether the visitor has visited the page before

- [00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3554) before by always checking for the presence of a

- [00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3556) by always checking for the presence of a cookie with the name of first underscore

- [00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3558) cookie with the name of first underscore request if this cookie is not present

- [00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3560) request if this cookie is not present we add it while setting the value to the

- [00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3562) we add it while setting the value to the current date and time

- [00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3564) current date and time if the cookie is present we can assume

- [00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3566) if the cookie is present we can assume that the visitor has visited the page

- [00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3568) that the visitor has visited the page before

- [00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3568) before and we can even tell the visitor when

- [00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3570) and we can even tell the visitor when the first visit occurred

- [00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3572) the first visit occurred okay again my cookie remain

- [00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3575) okay again my cookie remain after i closed the browser i have closed

- [00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3577) after i closed the browser i have closed the browser as you see

- [00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3579) the browser as you see and now let's run our application again

- [00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3581) and now let's run our application again to see if our cookie

- [00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3583) to see if our cookie persists or not

- [00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3587) persists or not we didn't set expired date so it should

- [00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3590) we didn't set expired date so it should remain persists uh for a while i believe

- [00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3594) remain persists uh for a while i believe or it is not persisting okay so by default

- [00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3597) it is not persisting okay so by default the cookie is not

- [00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3599) the cookie is not persisting and now we will see

- [01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3602) persisting and now we will see persisting cookie as well

- [01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3605) persisting cookie as well so this is basic cookies in a nutshell

- [01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3607) so this is basic cookies in a nutshell and now you know how to write and read

- [01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3609) and now you know how to write and read them

- [01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3610) them but there's a bit more you need to know

- [01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3612) but there's a bit more you need to know if you want to take full advantage of

- [01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3614) if you want to take full advantage of cookies

- [01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3616) cookies cookie options as an optional third

- [01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3619) cookie options as an optional third parameter to the append

- [01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3620) parameter to the append method we just used you can pass an

- [01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3622) method we just used you can pass an instance of the cookie options class

- [01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3625) instance of the cookie options class it allows you to adjust several

- [01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3627) it allows you to adjust several important aspects of your cookie

- [01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3628) important aspects of your cookie eg how long it should stay alive and

- [01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3631) eg how long it should stay alive and stuff like domains and path

- [01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3633) stuff like domains and path allow me to go through the most

- [01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3635) allow me to go through the most important properties but first

- [01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3637) important properties but first make sure that you have included the

- [01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3639) make sure that you have included the microsoft.asp.net core

- [01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3641) microsoft.asp.net core namespace where the cookie options class

- [01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3643) namespace where the cookie options class lives

- [01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3645) lives okay now you can create an instance of

- [01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3649) okay now you can create an instance of the cookie options class

- [01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3650) the cookie options class which will use the default settings and

- [01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3652) which will use the default settings and then pass it to the append method

- [01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3654) then pass it to the append method okay so it is like this let's do it

- [01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3661) okay well we are going to do it we are going to do it here

- [01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3663) going to do it here and now it will tell us to add this

- [01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3667) and now it will tell us to add this okay so let's check see the default uh

- [01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3671) okay so let's check see the default uh options of a cookie in the

- [01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3674) options of a cookie in the debug when we are doing a runtime check

- [01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3684) you see debugging is very useful if you want to learn

- [01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3686) want to learn what capabilities of a class

- [01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3689) what capabilities of a class has okay what's default parameters it

- [01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3693) has okay what's default parameters it has

- [01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3695) has okay in the cookie options that is

- [01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3697) okay in the cookie options that is domain it is

- [01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3698) domain it is null expires null http only false

- [01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3702) null expires null http only false is essential false max h null path

- [01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3706) is essential false max h null path nothing same site unspecified and

- [01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3708) nothing same site unspecified and secured false

- [01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3715) okay so i'm going to set an expired date so the expires it takes daytime

- [01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3719) so the expires it takes daytime offset

- [01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3727) so expires will be equal to name daytime offset

- [01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3731) name daytime offset and daytime offset can take daytime

- [01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3735) and daytime offset can take daytime time spawn long ticks years

- [01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3739) time spawn long ticks years whatever you want so i will just

- [01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3742) whatever you want so i will just tell that offset yeah

- [01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3745) tell that offset yeah so it will be daytime now and the

- [01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3749) so it will be daytime now and the offset will be nave time spawn

- [01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3752) offset will be nave time spawn and for the time spawn i will use

- [01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3756) and for the time spawn i will use uh days okay so 30 days

- [01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3760) uh days okay so 30 days zero hours zero minutes zero seconds

- [01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3763) zero hours zero minutes zero seconds okay

- [01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3764) okay now i will provide quicker options

- [01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3767) now i will provide quicker options like this now my um

- [01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3771) like this now my um cookie should be alive for 30 days

- [01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3775) cookie should be alive for 30 days okay so i should also see that in the

- [01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3780) okay so i should also see that in the browser inspection tools

- [01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3794) okay let's open the page oh we have an error

- [01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3808) okay not why don't we use just a date time instead of this

- [01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3810) time instead of this let's use daytime at days30

- [01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3813) let's use daytime at days30 now we should work

- [01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3840) okay let's open it yeah it is working you see now it is set

- [01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3842) you see now it is set and cookie explanation should be 30 days

- [01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3845) and cookie explanation should be 30 days i will also print that on the screen

- [01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3848) i will also print that on the screen in a moment so let's first check the

- [01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3850) in a moment so let's first check the application

- [01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3852) application and here and you see there is expires

- [01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3854) and here and you see there is expires might max age

- [01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3856) might max age and expired is set as 25

- [01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3859) and expired is set as 25 june these dates and

- [01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3863) june these dates and this is the size of the cookie okay

- [01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3866) this is the size of the cookie okay let's also print the expired date of the

- [01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3869) let's also print the expired date of the cookie

- [01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3870) cookie on the screen as

- [01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3873) on the screen as let me show you

- [01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3879) how we're gonna do that we are going to do that as here

- [01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3881) do that as here so the first time date will be this

- [01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3885) so the first time date will be this okay this is the daytime though i can't

- [01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3887) okay this is the daytime though i can't uh tell it here

- [01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3889) uh tell it here so let's add another thing to my model

- [01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3905) okay uh cookie expired date or cookie remaining

- [01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3910) or cookie remaining time yeah this is a better name all

- [01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3913) time yeah this is a better name all right it's not important but so here we will tell

- [01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3917) not important but so here we will tell that

- [01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3918) that my model.cookie remaining time equal to

- [01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3922) my model.cookie remaining time equal to okay http context cookies

- [01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3926) okay http context cookies then there is

- [01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3958) so this is getting its value but how can we get its expired date

- [01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3964) how can we get its expired date okay c sharp eighth quickie

- [01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3988) oh so it appears that we are not able to read the cookie expression date because

- [01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3990) read the cookie expression date because it is not

- [01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3991) it is not sent back to the server yet there is no

- [01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3994) sent back to the server yet there is no such feature

- [01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3995) such feature i think it is related to how browsers

- [01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3997) i think it is related to how browsers are designed

- [01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=3999) are designed so yeah now we are able to use the

- [01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4002) so yeah now we are able to use the cookie options as well

- [01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4026) okay and let's continue before passing it though so between the

- [01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4028) before passing it though so between the two lines of code

- [01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4029) two lines of code you likely want to change some of the

- [01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4031) you likely want to change some of the options

- [01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4032) options here are the most relevant ones cookie

- [01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4036) here are the most relevant ones cookie options

- [01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4036) options expires by default your cookie will be a

- [01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4040) expires by default your cookie will be a so-called session cookie

- [01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4042) so-called session cookie meaning that it will only live as long

- [01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4044) meaning that it will only live as long as the browser remains open once the

- [01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4045) as the browser remains open once the browser is closed

- [01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4047) browser is closed the cookie is deleted by the browser so

- [01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4049) the cookie is deleted by the browser so this is the default option

- [01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4051) this is the default option browser however you are free to change

- [01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4054) browser however you are free to change this behavior

- [01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4055) this behavior using the expires property this property

- [01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4058) using the expires property this property is a date time offset instance which

- [01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4060) is a date time offset instance which makes it easy to configure an expiry

- [01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4062) makes it easy to configure an expiry time like this

- [01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4063) time like this yeah this is the way we have uh users

- [01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4071) this will make the cookie expire in seven days

- [01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4073) seven days you can of course adjust this using the

- [01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4074) you can of course adjust this using the methods like add days ad hours and so on

- [01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4077) methods like add days ad hours and so on okay this is the classic c-sharp

- [01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4081) okay this is the classic c-sharp cookie options domain by default

- [01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4085) cookie options domain by default the cookie will be set for the domain

- [01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4086) the cookie will be set for the domain which made the request

- [01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4088) which made the request so if your page is accessed by the

- [01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4090) so if your page is accessed by the domain mywebsite.com

- [01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4092) domain mywebsite.com the cookie will be set for mywebsite.com

- [01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4096) the cookie will be set for mywebsite.com if your page is accessed using a sub

- [01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4098) if your page is accessed using a sub domain this subdomain will be used

- [01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4100) domain this subdomain will be used and this is important because a sub

- [01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4102) and this is important because a sub domain could be www

- [01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4105) domain could be www so if your page is accessed by

- [01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4109) so if your page is accessed by www.mywebsite.com

- [01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4110) www.mywebsite.com the cookie will by default only be

- [01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4112) the cookie will by default only be accessible from www.mywebsite.com and

- [01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4116) accessible from www.mywebsite.com and notmywebsite.com

- [01:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4118) notmywebsite.com therefore it can be a good idea to set

- [01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4121) therefore it can be a good idea to set the domain property to the base domain

- [01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4122) the domain property to the base domain of your website

- [01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4123) of your website prefixed with a dot like this okay so

- [01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4127) prefixed with a dot like this okay so this is another thing that you may want

- [01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4129) this is another thing that you may want to

- [01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4130) to be aware of

- [01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4136) now your cookie will be accessible from mywebsite.com

- [01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4137) mywebsite.com as well as all possible subdomains on

- [01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4140) as well as all possible subdomains on the other hand

- [01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4141) the other hand if you don't have full control over the

- [01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4143) if you don't have full control over the domain you may want to limit the domain

- [01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4145) domain you may want to limit the domain of the cookie

- [01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4145) of the cookie to the specific sub domain you control

- [01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4148) to the specific sub domain you control yeah this is also another possible

- [01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4150) yeah this is also another possible option

- [01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4151) option a possible argument logical argument

- [01:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4154) a possible argument logical argument cookie options path by default

- [01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4158) cookie options path by default the path of the cookie will be set to

- [01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4160) the path of the cookie will be set to slash which basically means that the

- [01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4162) slash which basically means that the cookie will be valid for all pages of

- [01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4164) cookie will be valid for all pages of the website

- [01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4165) the website however under certain conditions you may

- [01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4168) however under certain conditions you may need a cookie that's valid only for a

- [01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4169) need a cookie that's valid only for a specific page or folder

- [01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4172) specific page or folder this is easily accomplished with the

- [01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4174) this is easily accomplished with the path property

- [01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4175) path property okay this is also another important part

- [01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4177) okay this is also another important part you may want to limit your cookie to 13

- [01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4180) you may want to limit your cookie to 13 pages

- [01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4181) pages this would reduce your

- [01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4189) let's say prospect data between pages so let's

- [01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4197) test it so pad cookie and it does if it is not existing i am

- [01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4199) and it does if it is not existing i am going to add

- [01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4201) going to add pet cooking with

- [01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4208) pad equal to okay lecture 13 like this and i will set

- [01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4212) 13 like this and i will set a pet cookie and the value

- [01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4215) a pet cookie and the value this will be this cookie

- [01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4219) this will be this cookie will be valid for

- [01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4222) will be valid for okay this is not the thing that i'm

- [01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4224) okay this is not the thing that i'm going to change

- [01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4230) okay this cookie will be valid for only lecture 13

- [01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4235) valid for only lecture 13 uh directory of

- [01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4238) uh directory of pages okay

- [01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4244) pages okay okay and let's see how it is behaving

- [01:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4276) i'm not sure if it will work like this but let's try it

- [01:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4277) but let's try it so i will set the cookie here

- [01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4281) so i will set the cookie here and now when i refresh the network i

- [01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4283) and now when i refresh the network i will see the cookie is being sent

- [01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4287) will see the cookie is being sent let's check it out so we have

- [01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4291) let's check it out so we have first request here and then we have the

- [01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4293) first request here and then we have the pet cookie here

- [01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4295) pet cookie here this is also encoded like this html

- [01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4298) this is also encoded like this html encoded

- [01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4299) encoded and when i refresh this page i think it

- [01:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4301) and when i refresh this page i think it shouldn't be available to here

- [01:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4304) shouldn't be available to here so let's check it out so in localhost

- [01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4313) okay we have the first request yes so you see the other cookie

- [01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4315) you see the other cookie is not here because it is only available

- [01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4318) is not here because it is only available to this

- [01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4319) to this and this can improve your performance

- [01:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4322) and this can improve your performance because

- [01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4323) because you see the request size is changing so

- [01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4326) you see the request size is changing so the request size for this page

- [01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4328) the request size for this page for um let me check it

- [01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4336) okay there is request url responses okay request header for this

- [01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4339) responses okay request header for this page is

- [01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4341) page is it doesn't show

- [01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4359) okay response headers and okay request headers

- [01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4362) okay request headers okay so there is no request size but we

- [01:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4364) okay so there is no request size but we can see the cookie size

- [01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4366) can see the cookie size okay like this and for this page it will

- [01:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4370) okay like this and for this page it will be lesser because we will not

- [01:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4372) be lesser because we will not send that extra q key

- [01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4375) send that extra q key here so this will save some uh

- [01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4379) here so this will save some uh bytes transfer and imagine that you have

- [01:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4382) bytes transfer and imagine that you have a lot of cookies for certain pages then

- [01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4384) a lot of cookies for certain pages then it can save

- [01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4385) it can save much more

- [01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4392) byte to be transferred over the internet with that in place the cookie will now

- [01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4394) with that in place the cookie will now only be visible and readable to pages in

- [01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4396) only be visible and readable to pages in the users folder

- [01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4397) the users folder as well as subfolders to it more

- [01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4400) as well as subfolders to it more properties of cookie options

- [01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4403) properties of cookie options there are several other interesting

- [01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4405) there are several other interesting properties to be found on cookie options

- [01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4407) properties to be found on cookie options like is essential http only and secure

- [01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4411) like is essential http only and secure if you want to know more about them i

- [01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4413) if you want to know more about them i suggest that you have a look at the

- [01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4414) suggest that you have a look at the documentation for cookie options

- [01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4416) documentation for cookie options okay let's take a look at the cookie

- [01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4419) okay let's take a look at the cookie options

- [01:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4424) documentation and i wonder what is essential

- [01:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4431) indicates if this cookie is essential for the application to function

- [01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4432) for the application to function correctly

- [01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4434) correctly if true then consent policy checks may

- [01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4436) if true then consent policy checks may be bypassed

- [01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4438) be bypassed the default value is false okay this is

- [01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4441) the default value is false okay this is not very much

- [01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4442) not very much explanative that's open is essential

- [01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4445) explanative that's open is essential it is still not very much explanative

- [01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4449) it is still not very much explanative but it is essential could you

- [01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4482) okay essential cookies are session cookies persistent cookies and cookies

- [01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4487) that keep shopping basket okay cookies dropped by an adjective

- [01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4488) okay cookies dropped by an adjective such as google non-six segments not

- [01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4490) such as google non-six segments not essentially yeah

- [01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4496) essentially yeah yeah it is true but what is the

- [01:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4498) yeah it is true but what is the difference that it makes

- [01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4501) difference that it makes from the browser side

- [01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4511) maybe it is related to gdpr policy yeah yeah probably it is related to

- [01:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4514) yeah probably it is related to love love related policies

- [01:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4552) in the previous chapter we discussed cookies and their importance in the web

- [01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4554) cookies and their importance in the web world where the need for persistence between

- [01:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4558) requests is vital because of the stateless nature of the http protocol

- [01:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4561) stateless nature of the http protocol in most web frameworks even the old

- [01:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4563) in most web frameworks even the old school frameworks like php and asp

- [01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4566) school frameworks like php and asp classic the concept of sessions exists

- [01:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4570) classic the concept of sessions exists sessions versus cookies okay this is

- [01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4572) sessions versus cookies okay this is important cookies can be modified

- [01:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4574) important cookies can be modified sessions cannot be let's read it

- [01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4578) sessions cannot be let's read it while cookies are commonly used to share

- [01:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4580) while cookies are commonly used to share data between requests for longer periods

- [01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4582) data between requests for longer periods of time

- [01:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4583) of time even several years sessions are designed

- [01:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4585) even several years sessions are designed to exist for the duration of the current

- [01:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4587) to exist for the duration of the current session

- [01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4588) session a web browsing session can be difficult

- [01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4590) a web browsing session can be difficult to define

- [01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4591) to define especially with the move from desktop

- [01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4594) especially with the move from desktop laptop pcs to handheld devices

- [01:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4596) laptop pcs to handheld devices where a browsing session is commonly

- [01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4598) where a browsing session is commonly stopped and resumed many times

- [01:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4600) stopped and resumed many times in general you should treat data stored

- [01:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4602) in general you should treat data stored in the session system as temporary it

- [01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4604) in the session system as temporary it might disappear at any time

- [01:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4606) might disappear at any time eg because the user closes the browser

- [01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4608) eg because the user closes the browser window or restarts their handheld device

- [01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4611) window or restarts their handheld device this software session can be lost

- [01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4615) this software session can be lost anytime

- [01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4620) by default session data is stored for 20 minutes from the last request

- [01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4622) minutes from the last request this is the default but uh you can set

- [01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4625) this is the default but uh you can set this on the windows server or wherever

- [01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4627) this on the windows server or wherever you are running your uh

- [01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4628) you are running your uh website usually one hard or too hard it

- [01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4631) website usually one hard or too hard it is up to you how much time you are you

- [01:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4633) is up to you how much time you are you want your session to be valid and each

- [01:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4636) want your session to be valid and each time when the session is access it

- [01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4640) when the session is access it it will refresh the duration i believe

- [01:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4643) it will refresh the duration i believe so if you access a page and something is

- [01:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4645) so if you access a page and something is stored as session data for you

- [01:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4647) stored as session data for you it will be automatically removed after

- [01:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4649) it will be automatically removed after 20 minutes unless you have made a new

- [01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4651) 20 minutes unless you have made a new request within this time period

- [01:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4653) request within this time period okay this is uh there is something that

- [01:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4655) okay this is uh there is something that you should not

- [01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4656) you should not confuse you don't need to access that

- [01:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4659) confuse you don't need to access that session variable you just need to access

- [01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4661) session variable you just need to access that session

- [01:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4662) that session okay and when you send back your asv.net

- [01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4666) okay and when you send back your asv.net id back to server you are accessing that

- [01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4669) back to server you are accessing that session it means

- [01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4671) session it means and that is what it is let me show you

- [01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4675) and that is what it is let me show you what i mean so on the application

- [01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4678) what i mean so on the application and in here cookies you see there's

- [01:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4681) and in here cookies you see there's asp.net station id so whenever i make a

- [01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4684) asp.net station id so whenever i make a request to the server with this session

- [01:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4686) request to the server with this session id

- [01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4687) id it will refresh my session uh timeout

- [01:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4695) you can change the timeout duration when setting up sessions for your site

- [01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4697) setting up sessions for your site see below but as mentioned you shouldn't

- [01:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4699) see below but as mentioned you shouldn't try to use sessions to store data for

- [01:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4701) try to use sessions to store data for long periods of time

- [01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4704) long periods of time so if you are looking to store data

- [01:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4706) so if you are looking to store data between multiple sessions

- [01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4707) between multiple sessions use cookies otherwise the session

- [01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4709) use cookies otherwise the session mechanism is a great choice

- [01:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4712) mechanism is a great choice to understand the different use cases

- [01:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4714) to understand the different use cases think of a classic login system where

- [01:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4716) think of a classic login system where the user can check a checkbox to stay

- [01:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4718) the user can check a checkbox to stay logged in

- [01:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4719) logged in if this is not checked the login state

- [01:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4721) if this is not checked the login state might as well be stored as a session

- [01:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4723) might as well be stored as a session and then disappear when the user leaves

- [01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4725) and then disappear when the user leaves the site eg by closing the browser

- [01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4728) the site eg by closing the browser if it is checked a cookie should be used

- [01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4730) if it is checked a cookie should be used instead resulting in the user still

- [01:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4732) instead resulting in the user still being logged in the next time they

- [01:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4733) being logged in the next time they start their computer and visit your

- [01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4735) start their computer and visit your website

- [01:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4737) website however discussing sessions versus

- [01:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4739) however discussing sessions versus cookies is a little funny because in

- [01:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4741) cookies is a little funny because in general

- [01:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4742) general sessions can't really exist without

- [01:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4743) sessions can't really exist without cookies

- [01:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4745) cookies this is also true because without your

- [01:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4747) this is also true because without your asu that the session id

- [01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4749) asu that the session id the server cannot know your session

- [01:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4752) the server cannot know your session therefore it is reading that from cookie

- [01:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4754) therefore it is reading that from cookie and therefore without cookies no

- [01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4756) and therefore without cookies no sessions

- [01:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4757) sessions it's just sort of the reason is that

- [01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4760) it's just sort of the reason is that while cookies are stored on the device

- [01:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4762) while cookies are stored on the device of the user

- [01:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4763) of the user as small plain text files session data

- [01:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4765) as small plain text files session data is stored

- [01:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4766) is stored temporarily in memory on the server

- [01:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4769) temporarily in memory on the server however since your website will likely

- [01:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4771) however since your website will likely have more than one visitor

- [01:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4773) have more than one visitor the server needs to know which visitor a

- [01:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4775) the server needs to know which visitor a piece of session data belongs to

- [01:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4777) piece of session data belongs to for this it creates a session id which

- [01:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4780) for this it creates a session id which is stored as a so-called session cookie

- [01:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4782) is stored as a so-called session cookie on the visitor device

- [01:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4784) on the visitor device with this id the visitor can access

- [01:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4786) with this id the visitor can access their session data across

- [01:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4787) their session data across multiple requests asp.net core mvc

- [01:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4792) multiple requests asp.net core mvc adding support for sessions in previous

- [01:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4796) adding support for sessions in previous versions of the asp and asp.net

- [01:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4798) versions of the asp and asp.net frameworks

- [01:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4799) frameworks sessions would be available right out of

- [01:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4801) sessions would be available right out of the box

- [01:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4802) the box asp.net core is much more modular though

- [01:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4805) asp.net core is much more modular though allowing you to add the building blocks

- [01:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4807) allowing you to add the building blocks you need when you need the

- [01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4809) you need when you need the sessions are one of these building

- [01:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4811) sessions are one of these building blocks so to will have to add support

- [01:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4813) blocks so to will have to add support for it

- [01:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4814) for it this requires two steps first you need

- [01:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4818) this requires two steps first you need to install the microsoft.asp.net core

- [01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4821) to install the microsoft.asp.net core session nuget package in your project

- [01:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4823) session nuget package in your project okay we

- [01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4824) okay we already did this for this

- [01:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4827) already did this for this project we can i think we can see it i

- [01:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4829) project we can i think we can see it i think in the packages

- [01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4832) think in the packages frameworks so

- [01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4840) let's check our configuration file in startup and in here

- [01:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4847) we have your sessions if i remember correctly

- [01:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4850) correctly maybe i have edited the other

- [01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4854) maybe i have edited the other lectures called so that's it to add

- [01:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4857) lectures called so that's it to add people at mvc

- [01:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4868) okay we haven't added it but now i have added and okay so it appears that our

- [01:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4879) our framework is installed i'm in the session core

- [01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4886) okay now that we can set notice that you can optionally pass in one or several

- [01:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4888) optionally pass in one or several options to be used by the session

- [01:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4890) options to be used by the session functionality

- [01:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4892) functionality one of the things you can configure with

- [01:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4893) one of the things you can configure with this approach is the timeout duration

- [01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4895) this approach is the timeout duration as described previously in this article

- [01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4898) as described previously in this article like this

- [01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4898) like this okay so there's the timeout so we can

- [01:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4900) okay so there's the timeout so we can set timeout as

- [01:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4902) set timeout as well so let's add a timeout

- [01:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4905) well so let's add a timeout but you see this is idle timer so this

- [01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4908) but you see this is idle timer so this will timeout only if it is idle

- [01:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4910) will timeout only if it is idle otherwise it won't

- [01:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4912) otherwise it won't what other options there are

- [01:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4915) what other options there are there is cookie and i o time uh okay

- [01:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4919) there is cookie and i o time uh okay on my web servers on my uh on the game

- [01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4922) on my web servers on my uh on the game and the games i develop i use asp.net

- [01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4926) and the games i develop i use asp.net session state

- [01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4929) session state okay

- [01:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4936) and session state is a really good one to have weapons on

- [01:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4940) a really good one to have weapons on your website

- [01:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4942) your website um actually let's read what it is

- [01:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4946) um actually let's read what it is to understand better background

- [01:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4950) to understand better background asp.net session state enables you to

- [01:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4952) asp.net session state enables you to store and retrieve values for a user

- [01:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4955) store and retrieve values for a user as the user navigates asp.net pages in a

- [01:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4958) as the user navigates asp.net pages in a web application

- [01:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4960) web application http is a stateless protocol

- [01:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4963) http is a stateless protocol this means that a web server treats each

- [01:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4965) this means that a web server treats each http

- [01:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4966) http request for a page as an independent

- [01:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4969) request for a page as an independent request

- [01:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4969) request okay this is important each request is

- [01:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4974) okay this is important each request is treated as a independent request

- [01:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4978) treated as a independent request the server retains no knowledge of

- [01:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4979) the server retains no knowledge of variable values that were used during

- [01:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4981) variable values that were used during previous requests

- [01:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4983) previous requests asp.net session state identifies

- [01:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4986) asp.net session state identifies requests from the same browser during a

- [01:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4988) requests from the same browser during a limited time window as a session

- [01:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4990) limited time window as a session and provides a way to persist variable

- [01:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4992) and provides a way to persist variable values for the duration of that session

- [01:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4995) values for the duration of that session by default asp.net session state is

- [01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=4998) by default asp.net session state is enabled for all asp.net

- [01:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=5000) enabled for all asp.net applications okay and there are station

- [01:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=5003) applications okay and there are station variables session identifiers

- [01:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=5008) variables session identifiers okay there is session mods and

- [01:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=5011) okay there is session mods and let me show you the state modes actually

- [01:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=5014) let me show you the state modes actually i wanted to talk about that

- [01:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=5016) i wanted to talk about that okay so i am using state server mods

- [01:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=5018) okay so i am using state server mods there is also in prog mode

- [01:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=5020) there is also in prog mode this is rather related to a web server

- [01:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=5023) this is rather related to a web server that you are going to deploy your

- [01:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=5025) that you are going to deploy your application but

- [01:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=5026) application but let's read them as well this is

- [01:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=5028) let's read them as well this is important

- [01:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=5029) important so what are

- [01:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=5056) nine minutes to read asp.net session state supports several different

- [01:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=5058) session state supports several different storage options for session data

- [01:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=5060) storage options for session data each option is identified by a value in

- [01:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=5063) each option is identified by a value in the session state mode enumeration

- [01:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=5065) the session state mode enumeration the following list describes the

- [01:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=5067) the following list describes the available session state modes

- [01:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=5070) available session state modes in proc mode which stores session state

- [01:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=5072) in proc mode which stores session state in memory on the web server

- [01:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=5075) in memory on the web server this is the default state server mode

- [01:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=5078) this is the default state server mode which stores session state in a separate

- [01:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=5080) which stores session state in a separate process called the asp.net state service

- [01:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=5084) process called the asp.net state service this ensures that session state is

- [01:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=5086) this ensures that session state is preserved if the web application is

- [01:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=5088) preserved if the web application is restarted

- [01:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=5088) restarted and also makes session state available

- [01:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=5090) and also makes session state available to multiple web servers in a web farm

- [01:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=5093) to multiple web servers in a web farm this is the way i use because i start

- [01:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=5096) this is the way i use because i start multiple

- [01:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=5097) multiple processes for each website and therefore

- [01:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=5100) processes for each website and therefore they are becoming like a web farm

- [01:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=5102) they are becoming like a web farm and it also ensures that even your

- [01:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=5104) and it also ensures that even your application

- [01:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=5105) application is restarted and which happens when your

- [01:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=5108) is restarted and which happens when your application crashes or something happens

- [01:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=5110) application crashes or something happens and you still keep your sessions this is

- [01:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=5112) and you still keep your sessions this is the best mode

- [01:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=5114) the best mode that i will suggest you then there's

- [01:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=5116) that i will suggest you then there's also sql server mode but i think it is

- [01:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=5119) also sql server mode but i think it is not that much good so the best of this

- [01:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=5122) not that much good so the best of this stage server mode okay let's

- [01:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=5124) stage server mode okay let's return back to our

- [01:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=5130) story so he by the part we will be using improv

- [01:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=5131) improv mode here in our application

- [01:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=5135) mode here in our application and okay

- [01:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=5139) and okay we did set you session

- [01:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=5142) we did set you session okay let's continue reading it using

- [01:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=5145) okay let's continue reading it using sessions

- [01:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=5147) sessions with session support enabled we can now

- [01:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=5149) with session support enabled we can now start using them by accessing the

- [01:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=5151) start using them by accessing the session property on the http context

- [01:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=5154) session property on the http context when you include the microsoft.asp.net

- [01:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=5157) when you include the microsoft.asp.net core

- [01:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=5157) core http namespace you can access several

- [01:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=5160) http namespace you can access several get asterisk and set asterisk methods

- [01:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=5162) get asterisk and set asterisk methods which can be used to retrieve and store

- [01:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=5164) which can be used to retrieve and store data as session data

- [01:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=5167) data as session data allow me to demonstrate this with a

- [01:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=5168) allow me to demonstrate this with a complete although very simple example

- [01:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=5171) complete although very simple example it's basically a view with a form where

- [01:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=5173) it's basically a view with a form where the user can enter their name

- [01:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=5176) the user can enter their name once submitted the name is stored as

- [01:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=5178) once submitted the name is stored as session data and then automatically

- [01:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=5180) session data and then automatically passed to the view

- [01:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=5181) passed to the view and input field this will allow you to

- [01:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=5183) and input field this will allow you to see the entered name even after the

- [01:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=5185) see the entered name even after the redirect or reloading the page

- [01:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=5188) redirect or reloading the page first the view okay so

- [01:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=5191) first the view okay so this is about keeping values in the

- [01:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=5194) this is about keeping values in the session um

- [01:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=5197) session um so i'm going to

- [01:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=5207) set it like that in our application okay first let me demonstrate that how our

- [01:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=5209) first let me demonstrate that how our application behaves then we will

- [01:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=5211) application behaves then we will demonstrate it with session

- [01:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=5240) okay so when i load my page you see there is no car id or car name

- [01:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=5243) there is no car id or car name and the data we get from cookie is

- [01:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=5245) and the data we get from cookie is remaining

- [01:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=5247) remaining and however when i set something sandbag

- [01:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=5250) and however when i set something sandbag it is set it like this so in the set

- [01:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=5254) it is set it like this so in the set by the way it has overridden uh actually

- [01:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=5257) by the way it has overridden uh actually it didn't read the

- [01:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=5258) it didn't read the um cookie in the prospector for this

- [01:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=5263) um cookie in the prospector for this heads this will be

- [01:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=5264) heads this will be like this however when i return back to

- [01:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=5266) like this however when i return back to index

- [01:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=5267) index they are return it back to zero

- [01:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=5270) they are return it back to zero so what am i going to do is in my

- [01:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=5273) so what am i going to do is in my um let me check

- [01:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=5278) um let me check okay in my model binding

- [01:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=5281) okay in my model binding method i'm going to set the

- [01:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=5285) method i'm going to set the session as well so

- [01:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=5289) session as well so http context current

- [01:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=5296) session and for setting session let's say car name equal to

- [01:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=5301) let's say car name equal to uh my model does car name

- [01:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=5315) okay the session of this is a little bit different

- [01:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=5317) different yeah we need to use a

- [01:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=5320) yeah we need to use a set string

- [01:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=5323) set string okay set strings on the set string takes

- [01:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=5328) okay set strings on the set string takes a key and extreme value so

- [01:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=5331) a key and extreme value so the key will be this and the value will

- [01:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=5334) the key will be this and the value will be

- [01:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=5336) be car name okay

- [01:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=5339) car name okay like this

- [01:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=5346) okay and set let's set the car id can we set objects here in aceboo.that

- [01:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=5349) can we set objects here in aceboo.that we are able to set objects but

- [01:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=5356) it is setting a key and what other damage

- [01:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=5357) damage that is set so the set takes

- [01:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=5361) that is set so the set takes byte value i see

- [01:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=5369) can we convert this to byte such as the car

- [01:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=5371) car id to bite

- [01:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=5401) yeah there is it says you need to use bit converter bits

- [01:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=5402) bit converter bits converter dot get bytes and it will be

- [01:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=5406) converter dot get bytes and it will be integers

- [01:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=5414) okay car id and now we will read it from the session

- [01:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=5417) and now we will read it from the session string

- [01:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=5418) string so how we're gonna do it is

- [01:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=5422) so how we're gonna do it is in my model here i'm going to set

- [01:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=5425) in my model here i'm going to set car name equal to http context

- [01:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=5430) car name equal to http context session get string

- [01:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=5433) session get string so the guest link will be basically car

- [01:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=5436) so the guest link will be basically car name

- [01:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=5442) and then we will read the car id and for this we will use

- [01:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=5445) car id and for this we will use get 32

- [01:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=5454) there is set inch if there is settings you can set

- [01:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=5455) you can set it actually yeah there is set ink

- [01:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=5458) it actually yeah there is set ink but just uh use the regular set so we

- [01:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=5461) but just uh use the regular set so we can

- [01:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=5462) can turn byte into objects and get again so

- [01:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=5465) turn byte into objects and get again so you will learn it

- [01:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=5466) you will learn it so we will use get and the get will get

- [01:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=5470) so we will use get and the get will get a byte array therefore i need to convert

- [01:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=5473) a byte array therefore i need to convert it to

- [01:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=5474) it to integer back

- [01:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=5487) okay how do we do it okay then simply convert to

- [01:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=5491) convert to but there is a problem

- [01:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=5494) but there is a problem we need to convert only if this is not

- [01:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=5497) we need to convert only if this is not node okay

- [01:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=5505) get if equal equal to then if it is known we will set zero and if

- [01:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=5508) if it is known we will set zero and if it is not known

- [01:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=5510) it is not known okay we will convert it with

- [01:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=5515) okay we will convert it with a convert to inch 32

- [01:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=5519) a convert to inch 32 get yeah

- [01:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=5534) get and then i can use basically

- [01:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=5540) this okay and let's see what happens

- [01:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=5551) i could also use the set integer and get integer

- [01:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=5552) integer but i have used set method to

- [01:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=5555) but i have used set method to demonstrate

- [01:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=5562) keeping objects in the memory actually instead of this i have a better

- [01:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=5564) actually instead of this i have a better idea

- [01:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=5565) idea but first let's demonstrate this then i

- [01:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=5567) but first let's demonstrate this then i will uh show you different things

- [01:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=5570) will uh show you different things okay so it doesn't do a null check

- [01:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=5575) okay so it doesn't do a null check maybe an object like this i'm not sure

- [01:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=5578) maybe an object like this i'm not sure if this will work

- [01:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=5585) okay let's try like this because it doesn't have default

- [01:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=5587) doesn't have default null handling you see if the method is

- [01:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=5591) null handling you see if the method is not handling no

- [01:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=5592) not handling no node values then you have to do null

- [01:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=5617) so how do we do a new check maybe like this

- [01:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=5643) i think there was a new operator for this i will show you that

- [01:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=5646) for this i will show you that this is not the thing that i want

- [01:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=5660) okay so volume if not yeah so it will be like this if it is no then

- [01:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=5662) so it will be like this if it is no then this will be null value

- [01:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=5665) this will be null value yeah this is a better approach actually

- [01:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=5667) yeah this is a better approach actually so i can use this for this one as well

- [01:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=5677) oh no i can't use this for this one okay now it should work

- [01:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=5680) for this one okay now it should work so this will set that if the value is

- [01:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=5684) so this will set that if the value is null but it will still not solve our

- [01:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=5687) null but it will still not solve our problem yeah i'm pretty sure that it

- [01:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=5689) problem yeah i'm pretty sure that it will still throw an error

- [01:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=5691) will still throw an error so i need to make a good um

- [01:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=5719) okay so i need to make a session check like

- [01:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=5729) this is available keys try get back here and here's

- [01:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=5732) try get back here and here's yeah now i can use try get value

- [01:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=5736) yeah now i can use try get value but since i am using getstring

- [01:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=5740) but since i am using getstring then i have to use

- [01:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=5770) okay i have to check that if that key exist or not

- [01:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=5783) yeah i have to use any to be sure that this is

- [01:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=5785) this is there so

- [01:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=5798) so any would return bull equal to true then your guest string

- [01:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=5834) why there is any any returns bull yeah so what is the problem here

- [01:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=5841) yeah so what is the problem here okay if equal to

- [01:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=5845) okay if equal to else like this

- [01:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=5862) so any oh i know i know okay it takes string and will predicate

- [01:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=5867) okay it takes string and will predicate or

- [01:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=5868) or it take just any hmm

- [01:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=5873) it take just any hmm so for predicate i need to write a

- [01:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=5876) so for predicate i need to write a predicate like

- [01:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=5877) predicate like let me show it so this is related to

- [01:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=5879) let me show it so this is related to linq

- [01:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=5880) linq any pr equal to

- [01:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=5897) yeah and same will be for other things

- [01:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=5907) okay car id will be for car id if it is true we will use convert

- [01:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=5911) car id if it is true we will use convert to into

- [01:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=5911) to into integers like

- [01:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=5915) integers like here's

- [01:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=5922) okay and if it doesn't exist then we will return

- [01:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=5924) it doesn't exist then we will return zero yeah now it should work

- [01:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=5929) okay this may come to you a bit confusing so

- [01:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=5931) confusing so work on that on the

- [01:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=5934) work on that on the [Music]

- [01:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=5936) [Music] whole so basically what i did is i have

- [01:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=5938) whole so basically what i did is i have written a link queue

- [01:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=5940) written a link queue check it will check all the keys that it

- [01:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=5943) check it will check all the keys that it contains and if there is any match

- [01:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=5945) contains and if there is any match it would return true and if it is true i

- [01:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=5947) it would return true and if it is true i will just use the get string

- [01:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=5950) will just use the get string okay

- [01:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=5958) okay it says that session is not modified

- [01:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=5959) modified so by default it is not set uh mod uh

- [01:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=5962) so by default it is not set uh mod uh setting the session

- [01:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=5964) setting the session i think it is setting up the session at

- [01:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=5967) i think it is setting up the session at the first

- [01:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=5970) the first session oh but that doesn't make sense

- [01:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=5974) session oh but that doesn't make sense let's check our startup

- [01:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=5977) let's check our startup did we set the use session yeah we have

- [01:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=5980) did we set the use session yeah we have user session

- [01:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=5988) okay where services at session here at session done at mvc maybe we need to

- [01:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=5992) at session done at mvc maybe we need to add session

- [01:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=5995) add session for mvc i'm not sure but that doesn't

- [01:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=5998) for mvc i'm not sure but that doesn't make sense either

- [01:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=6000) make sense either so on here i will check if session is

- [01:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=6005) so on here i will check if session is started

- [01:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=6005) started if session

- [01:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=6009) if session is available yeah

- [01:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=6024) so maybe our texts were not necessary i'm not sure

- [01:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=6028) not necessary i'm not sure maybe the root cause was different

- [01:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=6080) oh i see i see we didn't install the nuget package but it is still not giving

- [01:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=6082) nuget package but it is still not giving an error therefore we have to install that

- [01:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=6086) error therefore we have to install that nougat package

- [01:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=6112) okay microsoft is about net core session latest table let's

- [01:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=6114) latest table let's install it it doesn't drop an error but

- [01:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=6117) install it it doesn't drop an error but it is not working this is so

- [01:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=6120) it is not working this is so unexpected i would expect something like

- [01:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=6123) unexpected i would expect something like this to happen

- [01:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=6146) oh output it is finished so it has installed i think

- [01:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=6148) installed i think okay let's check out the packages let's

- [01:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=6150) okay let's check out the packages let's refresh it

- [01:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=6202) in our startup maybe i also need to add let's check it so we have to install

- [01:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=6206) let's check it so we have to install package

- [01:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=6207) package then we need to add session

- [01:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=6224) oh i see we also need to call you session from

- [01:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=6226) session from our configure method which is in the

- [01:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=6232) our configure method which is in the startup

- [01:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=6234) startup okay so in configure services we add

- [01:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=6237) okay so in configure services we add uh add session then in

- [01:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=6240) uh add session then in startup we add use

- [01:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=6244) startup we add use sessions let's add it to here like this

- [01:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=6254) and at session okay now it will work i'm pretty

- [01:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=6258) session okay now it will work i'm pretty sure of it

- [01:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=6269) complete time check these requirements but it is not at the moment

- [01:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=6283) okay now it is working and there is nothing here i can refresh

- [01:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=6285) nothing here i can refresh so let's say something like this test

- [01:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=6289) so let's say something like this test okay it is here and let's return back

- [01:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=6292) okay it is here and let's return back okay

- [01:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=6293) okay we didn't set it

- [01:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=6301) update legacy yeah we didn't set it in the update i guess we just set it in our

- [01:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=6303) the update i guess we just set it in our bind

- [01:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=6304) bind code so car id 100

- [01:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=6307) code so car id 100 car name test okay we did update we

- [01:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=6310) car name test okay we did update we return back

- [01:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=6311) return back and okay so it says that

- [01:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=6314) and okay so it says that the input was not in correct because we

- [01:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=6318) the input was not in correct because we were using car name

- [01:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=6319) were using car name we have to use car id

- [01:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=6327) okay now since i restart my session will restart 2 reset 2

- [01:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=6353) okay nothing set let's set 100 111 test okay set

- [01:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=6358) 100 111 test okay set okay still car

- [01:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=6362) okay still car id oh this won't be guest string this is

- [01:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=6364) id oh this won't be guest string this is what we get

- [01:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=6365) what we get not get string okay we are making a lot

- [01:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=6368) not get string okay we are making a lot of

- [01:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=6370) of mistakes

- [01:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=6396) okay 100 and test

- [01:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=6401) and oh we still have a problem unable to cast object type by

- [01:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=6403) cast object type by system convertible

- [01:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=6406) system convertible by system byte integers

- [01:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=6434) um we use byte com bit conversion not convert yeah

- [01:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=6437) not convert yeah okay bit converter to integer

- [01:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=6447) you see we are wasting a lot of time with this approach i will show you how

- [01:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=6449) with this approach i will show you how to save an object

- [01:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=6450) to save an object and then return it back

- [01:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=6469) okay let's test 100 test okay that is set

- [01:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=6472) test okay that is set and let's return back index okay

- [01:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=6475) and let's return back index okay okay our id is not working

- [01:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=6480) okay our id is not working why 100 100 okay

- [01:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=6483) why 100 100 okay that's yeah car oil is not working

- [01:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=6509) okay i have a different idea which will be better

- [01:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=6512) be better so in my legacy code i am going to set

- [01:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=6515) so in my legacy code i am going to set another thing like

- [01:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=6519) another thing like we already have our model therefore i

- [01:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=6521) we already have our model therefore i will set

- [01:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=6522) will set my model directly as a byte

- [01:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=6554) it's like this so let's add this to our global object

- [01:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=6565) pairs so this will take an object and return by so i will make this public

- [01:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=6568) return by so i will make this public static

- [01:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=6568) static byte like this

- [01:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=6572) byte like this this will be on the sh

- [01:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=6582) yeah this will be on the um global methods here

- [01:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=6585) global methods here like this

- [01:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=6592) and i will make this as an extension like this and for binary

- [01:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=6596) extension like this and for binary member

- [01:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=6597) member formatters

- [01:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=6610) okay this will let us save as byte and serialize

- [01:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=6617) okay so this is absolute so let's look for another code

- [01:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=6626) okay and there is also by the data object

- [01:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=6645) what is the new method so these are all the methods probably

- [01:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=6661) actually i was going to show you with jason's serializer but

- [01:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=6664) jason's serializer but yeah let's use json serializer let's use

- [01:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=6666) yeah let's use json serializer let's use the

- [01:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=6667) the newest technology instead of this

- [01:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=6671) newest technology instead of this so what we are going to do is we are

- [01:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=6672) so what we are going to do is we are going to install

- [01:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=6681) uh json installs are chosen let's install it

- [01:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=6685) installs are chosen let's install it basically what we are going to do is

- [01:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=6688) basically what we are going to do is very simple

- [01:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=6696) i already shown this in my object oriented programming at in my

- [01:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=6699) object oriented programming at in my advanced programming

- [01:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=6701) advanced programming i believe so basically we will set

- [01:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=6704) i believe so basically we will set string and my

- [01:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=6708) string and my model and it's not

- [01:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=6711) model and it's not uh use json

- [01:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=6737) okay and yes okay like this

- [01:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=6751) my model so i will serialize model as a setting

- [01:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=6752) setting and save that in the session like this

- [01:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=6756) and save that in the session like this and then simply

- [01:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=6764) here's if it is available i am going to mold

- [01:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=6766) if it is available i am going to mold him

- [01:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=6773) i will tell my model equal to jason salt jesus united based device

- [01:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=6779) jason salt jesus united based device what is this

- [01:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=6787) here okay [Music]

- [01:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=6790) [Music] this is object will be lecture 13

- [01:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=6801) like this and it will be like this i wonder if it is

- [01:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=6802) wonder if it is checking by default null check

- [01:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=6813) so it will be easier how did we set the session with the set recession as

- [01:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=6816) session with the set recession as okay my model i will name it as

- [01:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=6819) okay my model i will name it as like this so won't get confused

- [01:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=6824) like this so won't get confused and if it is not moving okay string

- [01:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=6828) and if it is not moving okay string is lower empty

- [01:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=6831) is lower empty of course we will change it like this

- [01:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=6845) so instead of saving individual values of an object

- [01:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=6846) of an object i will save it as a json

- [01:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=6850) i will save it as a json string and then i will read the string

- [01:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=6853) string and then i will read the string and turn that into an object with

- [01:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=6854) and turn that into an object with sterilization and deserialization

- [01:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=6857) sterilization and deserialization this is also the

- [01:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=6860) this is also the current approach that is suggested by

- [01:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=6863) current approach that is suggested by the

- [01:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=6864) the microsoft so test2

- [01:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=6868) microsoft so test2 okay and let's refresh yes it is working

- [01:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=6872) okay and let's refresh yes it is working it is working on this browser however

- [01:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=6875) it is working on this browser however what happens if

- [01:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=6875) what happens if i delete my session parameter

- [01:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=6879) i delete my session parameter from the application

- [01:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=6884) from the application here so i will delete all

- [01:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=6887) here so i will delete all cookies and i will refresh the page like

- [01:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=6890) cookies and i will refresh the page like this you see they are gone because my session

- [01:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=6893) you see they are gone because my session is reset

- [01:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=6894) is reset since it is lost so 500 555 something

- [01:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=6898) since it is lost so 500 555 something like that

- [01:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=6900) like that test and oh we have to use

- [01:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=6903) test and oh we have to use the let me check it live

- [01:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=6909) the let me check it live up here actually another test tool

- [01:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=6913) up here actually another test tool now it is set add set let's test it on

- [01:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=6917) now it is set add set let's test it on internet explorer and it is zero because

- [01:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=6920) internet explorer and it is zero because now i have different session for this

- [01:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=6922) now i have different session for this browser and

- [01:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=6923) browser and i have differentiation for this browser

- [01:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=6926) i have differentiation for this browser each browser have its

- [01:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=6927) each browser have its own session until i close the

- [01:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=6931) own session until i close the browser

- [01:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=6937) all right so okay how to properly save and retrieve

- [01:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=6941) properly save and retrieve the objects or different

- [01:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=6945) the objects or different data types in session of

- [01:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=6949) data types in session of okay so that net let me see

- [01:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=6953) okay so that net let me see core bits

- [01:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=6960) okay json converts the serialized object

- [01:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=6973) jason what [Music]

- [01:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=6992) okay it is okay this is the recommended right now oh currently

- [01:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=7001) all right now we have seen everything about stations how to keep them

- [01:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=7004) about stations how to keep them we can also access stations in the

- [01:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=7008) we can also access stations in the weave i'm not sure let's check it out

- [01:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=7023) and we see we shouldn't access the session in the

- [01:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=7024) session in the uh view actually this is against mvc

- [01:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=7027) uh view actually this is against mvc approach you should access the session

- [01:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=7029) approach you should access the session in your controller

- [01:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=7030) in your controller okay all right

- [01:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=7041) all right so let's move to the next article

- [01:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=7042) article and it is caging

- [01:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=7055) when you create your first asp.net mvc website

- [01:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=7056) website you are probably not too worried about

- [01:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=7058) you are probably not too worried about performance

- [01:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=7059) performance if you make a basic website everything

- [01:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=7061) if you make a basic website everything will run fast and smooth

- [01:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=7063) will run fast and smooth thanks to all the effort that has been

- [01:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=7065) thanks to all the effort that has been put into the framework

- [01:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=7067) put into the framework so you likely haven't given performance

- [01:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=7069) so you likely haven't given performance any thoughts and that's fine

- [01:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=7070) any thoughts and that's fine but as soon your website evolves into

- [01:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=7072) but as soon your website evolves into something more complex

- [01:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=7074) something more complex improving the performance might become

- [01:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=7075) improving the performance might become very relevant

- [01:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=7077) very relevant an excellent place to start is caching

- [01:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=7080) an excellent place to start is caching when talking caching in websites there

- [01:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=7083) when talking caching in websites there are several ways of doing things

- [01:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=7084) are several ways of doing things but it can generally be divided into two

- [01:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=7086) but it can generally be divided into two categories

- [01:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=7087) categories client-side caching and server-side

- [01:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=7089) client-side caching and server-side caching and even though asp.net is a

- [01:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=7092) caching and even though asp.net is a server-side technology

- [01:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=7093) server-side technology it can help you utilize both types of

- [01:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=7095) it can help you utilize both types of caching

- [01:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=7097) caching as you may or may not know your browser

- [01:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=7099) as you may or may not know your browser is likely already caching stuff for you

- [01:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=7101) is likely already caching stuff for you on your website

- [01:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=7102) on your website yeah it is so true let me show you

- [01:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=7106) yeah it is so true let me show you for example let's uh think about this

- [01:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=7109) for example let's uh think about this page

- [01:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=7110) page let's go to network okay and

- [01:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=7115) let's go to network okay and let's click refresh

- [01:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=7121) so here you see there are initiated size time type and status so here you see

- [01:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=7125) time type and status so here you see this cache this cage means that

- [01:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=7129) this cache this cage means that my browser didn't load that from the

- [01:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=7132) my browser didn't load that from the internet anymore

- [01:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=7133) internet anymore again i think i mean uh you see

- [01:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=7136) again i think i mean uh you see therefore they are

- [01:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=7137) therefore they are zero bytes and this is not a cached

- [01:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=7141) zero bytes and this is not a cached file it is the requested page and this

- [01:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=7145) file it is the requested page and this is also dynamic probably so it is not

- [01:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=7147) is also dynamic probably so it is not cached as well so this is a

- [01:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=7151) cached as well so this is a client-side browser caching by default

- [01:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=7153) client-side browser caching by default uh

- [01:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=7154) uh the server or knowledge

- [01:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=7158) the server or knowledge doesn't have to do anything for this

- [01:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=7160) doesn't have to do anything for this type of caching

- [01:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=7168) it has a lot of mechanisms for fetching and storing resources which are normally

- [01:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=7170) and storing resources which are normally static

- [01:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=7171) static like images and style sheets css so that

- [01:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=7174) like images and style sheets css so that they don't have to be downloaded for

- [01:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=7175) they don't have to be downloaded for each request made to your web server

- [01:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=7178) each request made to your web server this is an example of client-side

- [01:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=7180) this is an example of client-side caching since it's performed by the

- [01:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=7182) caching since it's performed by the client the browser but you can actually

- [01:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=7184) the browser but you can actually accomplish the same type of caching for

- [01:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=7186) accomplish the same type of caching for the actual content of your pages

- [01:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=7188) the actual content of your pages we'll discuss this in one of the next

- [01:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=7190) we'll discuss this in one of the next articles where we will be looking into

- [01:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=7192) articles where we will be looking into the response cache technique

- [01:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=7195) the response cache technique if you're looking for ways of caching

- [01:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=7196) if you're looking for ways of caching stuff directly on the server

- [01:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=7198) stuff directly on the server instead of on the client you should be

- [02:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=7200) instead of on the client you should be looking into topics like in-memory

- [02:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=7202) looking into topics like in-memory caching and output caching

- [02:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=7204) caching and output caching we'll talk more about that as well in

- [02:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=7206) we'll talk more about that as well in this chapter

- [02:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=7207) this chapter okay so let's continue

- [02:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=7211) okay so let's continue proceed caching

- [02:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=7215) proceed caching response cache as we discussed in the

- [02:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=7219) response cache as we discussed in the introduction article for this chapter

- [02:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=7221) introduction article for this chapter all modern browsers comes with a lot of

- [02:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=7223) all modern browsers comes with a lot of caching functionality built in

- [02:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=7225) caching functionality built in they will always try to detect static

- [02:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=7227) they will always try to detect static stuff like images and style sheets

- [02:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=7229) stuff like images and style sheets and cache it for the next request made

- [02:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=7231) and cache it for the next request made by the user

- [02:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=7233) by the user this doesn't apply to the actual page

- [02:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=7235) this doesn't apply to the actual page though because the browser has no way of

- [02:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=7237) though because the browser has no way of knowing whether your server will serve

- [02:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=7238) knowing whether your server will serve the exact same response

- [02:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=7240) the exact same response on the next request or not that doesn't

- [02:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=7242) on the next request or not that doesn't mean that caching of the page is not

- [02:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=7244) mean that caching of the page is not possible

- [02:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=7245) possible it just means that you have to guide the

- [02:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=7247) it just means that you have to guide the browser for that purpose

- [02:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=7249) browser for that purpose asp.net mvc comes with a technique

- [02:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=7252) asp.net mvc comes with a technique called response cache

- [02:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=7255) called response cache response cache sometimes referred to as

- [02:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=7258) response cache sometimes referred to as http based response caching

- [02:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=7260) http based response caching is most commonly applied directly to the

- [02:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=7262) is most commonly applied directly to the action of a controller

- [02:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=7264) action of a controller to let the browser know that it can

- [02:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=7265) to let the browser know that it can safely cache the response for a specific

- [02:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=7267) safely cache the response for a specific amount of time

- [02:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=7269) amount of time so if the result of your controller

- [02:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=7271) so if the result of your controller action is always static

- [02:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=7273) action is always static or at least remain the same for a

- [02:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=7274) or at least remain the same for a specific amount of time

- [02:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=7276) specific amount of time you can tell the browser to cache it

- [02:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=7277) you can tell the browser to cache it like this

- [02:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=7282) okay so this is the response cache that we can tell browser to cache

- [02:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=7285) we can tell browser to cache and let's edit i will cache it for three

- [02:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=7288) and let's edit i will cache it for three minutes

- [02:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=7289) minutes okay so this is based on minutes i

- [02:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=7294) okay so this is based on minutes i believe

- [02:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=7297) believe oh it is based on seconds not the

- [02:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=7299) oh it is based on seconds not the minutes so

- [02:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=7301) minutes so we need to change it

- [02:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=7310) we need to change it let's close

- [02:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=7315) okay so this cache will be applied to index page only probably

- [02:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=7317) index page only probably so let's see it does that yes seconds

- [02:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=7322) so let's see it does that yes seconds okay so for two minutes we are going to

- [02:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=7325) okay so for two minutes we are going to catch the response

- [02:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=7327) catch the response and see what happens

- [02:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=7344) okay first time notice let's uh add something to the uh

- [02:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=7346) something to the uh index so this is now another page and

- [02:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=7348) index so this is now another page and let's go back to the index

- [02:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=7351) let's go back to the index and let's change the values so that we

- [02:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=7353) and let's change the values so that we can see if it is cached

- [02:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=7354) can see if it is cached or not and let's go okay it's not

- [02:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=7358) or not and let's go okay it's not getting cache it right now it is

- [02:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=7360) getting cache it right now it is updating every moment

- [02:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=7363) updating every moment let's go index document

- [02:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=7366) let's go index document response location okay currently

- [02:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=7370) response location okay currently it is no case no store so not working

- [02:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=7390) oh i see so it does ignore the cache when we click refresh but if i don't

- [02:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=7393) when we click refresh but if i don't click refresh and if i

- [02:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=7395) click refresh and if i click enter

- [02:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=7398) click enter let's see what happens

- [02:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=7401) let's see what happens okay still no cache yeah

- [02:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=7405) okay still no cache yeah let's see the response headers

- [02:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=7416) yeah no cash interestingly but we have put a cash to here

- [02:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=7449) oh we need to add response cache and enable response caching so currently it

- [02:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=7451) enable response caching so currently it won't work

- [02:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=7453) won't work so let's enable that

- [02:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=7457) so let's enable that response cache and at the

- [02:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=7461) response cache and at the we get package

- [02:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=7477) if your page is not starting you wouldn't like me to

- [02:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=7479) wouldn't like me to use caching but if your page is pretty

- [02:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=7483) use caching but if your page is pretty much static then you can use

- [02:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=7485) much static then you can use response caching

- [02:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=7491) normal i don't use response casing in any of my page

- [02:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=7493) any of my page so now we need to add response caching

- [02:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=7496) so now we need to add response caching like

- [02:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=7497) like session in in our startup

- [02:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=7507) okay so first well i will add here service at response caching and then i

- [02:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=7509) service at response caching and then i will add

- [02:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=7512) will add up use response

- [02:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=7515) up use response okay there is response compression yeah

- [02:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=7517) okay there is response compression yeah we should use that

- [02:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=7519) we should use that and up use response caching

- [02:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=7550) okay then we can add value by query keys and with which will make it cache it by

- [02:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=7555) and with which will make it cache it by query or unable to resolve transfer type

- [02:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=7559) query or unable to resolve transfer type or for response compression it is

- [02:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=7561) or for response compression it is another thing so

- [02:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=7563) another thing so let's also see what is response

- [02:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=7565) let's also see what is response compression

- [02:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=7566) compression since we are on that

- [02:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=7597) network bandwidth is a limited resource reducing the size of the response

- [02:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=7599) reducing the size of the response usually increases the responsiveness of

- [02:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=7601) usually increases the responsiveness of an app often dramatically one way to reduce

- [02:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=7605) often dramatically one way to reduce payload sizes is to compress an

- [02:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=7607) payload sizes is to compress an app's responses

- [02:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=7612) when to use response compression middleware

- [02:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=7614) middleware use server-based response compression

- [02:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=7616) use server-based response compression technologies in iis

- [02:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=7617) technologies in iis apache orange inks the performance of

- [02:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=7620) apache orange inks the performance of the middleware probably won't match that

- [02:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=7622) the middleware probably won't match that of the server modules

- [02:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=7624) of the server modules okay so if you are work running your

- [02:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=7627) okay so if you are work running your website on a

- [02:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=7628) website on a windows server on iis then use the

- [02:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=7631) windows server on iis then use the static and dynamic compression of iis

- [02:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=7633) static and dynamic compression of iis and you don't need to use this

- [02:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=7635) and you don't need to use this middleware however

- [02:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=7637) middleware however if it is not possible uh this is apache

- [02:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=7641) if it is not possible uh this is apache or nix compression

- [02:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=7643) or nix compression then you can use response compression

- [02:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=7653) so okay so we don't need it actually but at this

- [02:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=7672) okay so we can pass that so let's just write our response

- [02:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=7675) write our response caching right now which is our topic

- [02:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=7684) so you can cache response based on an id and you can also

- [02:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=7688) id and you can also cache by headers like this or here

- [02:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=7706) okay there is disabled cache and preserve block so currently i am not

- [02:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=7708) preserve block so currently i am not disabling cache

- [02:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=7711) disabling cache which is still no cache

- [02:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=7716) which is still no cache yeah still rotational storage

- [02:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=7723) okay so let's get back to our controller and

- [02:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=7730) maybe we need to add this to the top of the controller but that wouldn't make

- [02:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=7732) of the controller but that wouldn't make sense

- [02:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=7743) let's try like this because our response caching is not working

- [02:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=7747) our response caching is not working we have added response caching we have

- [02:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=7750) we have added response caching we have installed

- [02:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=7759) okay this is how we get perfect package as well

- [02:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=7765) so let's inspect let's check the okay oh by the way

- [02:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=7768) let's check the okay oh by the way replacement

- [02:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=7770) replacement calls no catching

- [02:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=7773) calls no catching okay still no cash

- [02:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=7799) let's see we tried internet explorers network

- [02:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=7856) okay someone also asked our question terminal middleweight such a static

- [02:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=7858) terminal middleweight such a static parameter they must

- [02:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=7859) parameter they must not process responsibility specification

- [02:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=7862) not process responsibility specification middleware

- [02:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=7887) okay so there are a lot of things that has to be valid for caching to work

- [02:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=7899) that has to be valid for caching to work um

- [02:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=7918) uh since we are using cookies then we can't response cashier

- [02:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=7932) yeah so on our application currently we can use response cache

- [02:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=7934) can use response cache but now you have the idea

- [02:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=7950) for response cache to work you need to [Music]

- [02:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=7953) [Music] satisfy this conditions

- [02:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=7956) satisfy this conditions demands here

- [02:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=7962) so i will get a link of this into our application so

- [02:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=7969) into our application so let me note that he is

- [02:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=7980) for response cash to work this conditions have to be

- [02:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=7984) this conditions have to be satisfied okay there are a lot of

- [02:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=7987) satisfied okay there are a lot of conditions

- [02:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=7988) conditions and i will just move to the next

- [02:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=7991) and i will just move to the next article and then there is output

- [02:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=7996) article and then there is output cache response cache is very hard to

- [02:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=7999) cache response cache is very hard to obtain

- [02:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=7999) obtain because we are using a lot of other

- [02:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=8002) because we are using a lot of other middlewares or cookies

- [02:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=8005) middlewares or cookies caching output cache

- [02:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=8009) caching output cache in asp.net web forms as well as in

- [02:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=8012) in asp.net web forms as well as in asp.net mvc

- [02:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=8014) asp.net mvc versions before the core framework the

- [02:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=8016) versions before the core framework the concept of output cache existed

- [02:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=8018) concept of output cache existed it made it extremely easy to cache

- [02:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=8020) it made it extremely easy to cache entire pages slash views

- [02:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=8022) entire pages slash views just like we saw with response cache in

- [02:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=8024) just like we saw with response cache in the previous article but stored in

- [02:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=8026) the previous article but stored in memory on the web server

- [02:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=8029) memory on the web server the concept of output cache hasn't made

- [02:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=8031) the concept of output cache hasn't made it into the core version of the dot net

- [02:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=8033) it into the core version of the dot net framework as of writing this

- [02:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=8034) framework as of writing this but fortunately for us the community has

- [02:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=8037) but fortunately for us the community has developed a version

- [02:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=8038) developed a version based on in-memory caching which gives

- [02:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=8040) based on in-memory caching which gives you the same opportunities as the output

- [02:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=8042) you the same opportunities as the output cache features that was built into

- [02:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=8043) cache features that was built into previous versions

- [02:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=8045) previous versions in fact there are likely several

- [02:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=8047) in fact there are likely several implementations out there

- [02:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=8049) implementations out there but i will base this article on the web

- [02:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=8052) but i will base this article on the web webessentials.aspnetcore.output caching

- [02:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=8053) webessentials.aspnetcore.output caching new get package

- [02:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=8056) new get package as soon as you have installed this

- [02:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=8057) as soon as you have installed this package in your project you just need to

- [02:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=8059) package in your project you just need to make a couple of small adjustments in

- [02:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=8061) make a couple of small adjustments in your startup.cs file

- [02:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=8063) your startup.cs file to start using the output cache

- [02:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=8064) to start using the output cache directive okay

- [02:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=8066) directive okay so this

- [02:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=8069) so this is it is

- [02:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=8082) i think output cash is better than client side cash probably it won't

- [02:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=8086) client side cash probably it won't be based on these

- [02:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=8091) be based on these previous requirements but let's try it

- [02:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=8095) previous requirements but let's try it so you get package packages

- [02:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=8098) so you get package packages output cache

- [02:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=8109) and asp.net application module okay and

- [02:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=8112) okay and [Music]

- [02:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=8113) [Music] what is the asynchronous probably this

- [02:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=8116) what is the asynchronous probably this is not what we are looking for

- [02:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=8136) yeah weapon essentially as we do not ask for application

- [02:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=8138) for application this is what we need

- [02:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=8149) okay then we can add up use

- [02:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=8181) okay i think they are installed you see a lot of

- [02:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=8183) a lot of a lot of things are getting installed

- [02:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=8186) a lot of things are getting installed for just output cache so many

- [02:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=8192) just output cache so many if you don't need all this you shouldn't

- [02:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=8194) if you don't need all this you shouldn't use output caching

- [02:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=8206) use output caching okay and now let's try

- [02:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=8234) okay you see some of the uh framework may not be compatible with our

- [02:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=8237) framework may not be compatible with our version

- [02:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=8244) i think it is displayed in artwork yeah but let's just try no harm

- [02:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=8247) but let's just try no harm okay so currently should we cache it

- [02:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=8251) okay so currently should we cache it and let's change something like this

- [02:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=8255) and let's change something like this and let's go back to page yeah it is

- [02:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=8257) and let's go back to page yeah it is cache it yes it is working

- [02:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=8259) cache it yes it is working so it is cache it for two minutes and i

- [02:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=8262) so it is cache it for two minutes and i will make it for 15 seconds so that we

- [02:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=8265) will make it for 15 seconds so that we can see

- [02:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=8271) so output caching is working working which would reduce our server

- [02:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=8274) which would reduce our server uh

- [02:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=8301) okay so currently does not cache it so let's a test test test

- [02:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=8305) cache it so let's a test test test okay it is now trying okay so it

- [02:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=8308) okay it is now trying okay so it currently is loading from cache and in

- [02:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=8311) currently is loading from cache and in 10 seconds it should load

- [02:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=8314) 10 seconds it should load from

- [02:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=8326) okay i think we are still reading cash okay 15 seconds already passed

- [02:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=8331) okay 15 seconds already passed let's check the debug

- [02:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=8344) okay interesting so i will put a breakpoint here

- [02:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=8352) yeah breakpoint is not entering but with 10 seconds already

- [02:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=8361) passed okay still it is reading from cash it is

- [02:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=8374) interesting wow when i get a clear fish it doesn't

- [02:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=8377) wow when i get a clear fish it doesn't change the behaviors

- [02:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=8389) change the behaviors okay it says it is second

- [02:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=8397) but i don't see it i mean it's not working after the 15 seconds

- [02:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=8401) not working after the 15 seconds okay this is working and now no nothing

- [02:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=8422) enable server side output caching duration

- [02:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=8422) duration is seconds 15 seconds

- [02:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=8427) is seconds 15 seconds so let's try again

- [02:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=8446) okay cash is now okay first time it is working

- [02:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=8448) working second time cash it now let's see how

- [02:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=8451) second time cash it now let's see how much seconds it will be cash it for

- [02:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=8465) maybe it refreshes the cache each time we request but okay now

- [02:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=8467) each time we request but okay now refreshed

- [02:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=8468) refreshed okay okay now working here yeah

- [02:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=8472) okay okay now working here yeah so we should put it here okay let's make

- [02:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=8475) so we should put it here okay let's make a test

- [02:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=8476) a test like this okay okay

- [02:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=8479) like this okay okay still on the cache on the cache

- [02:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=8492) okay sometimes it refreshes the page but our session is lost or something

- [02:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=8495) but our session is lost or something like that

- [02:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=8500) like that yeah this is interesting so

- [02:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=8505) yeah this is interesting so let's set context as yeah

- [02:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=8508) let's set context as yeah i need to set the context with this okay

- [02:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=8511) i need to set the context with this okay let's refresh

- [02:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=8512) let's refresh then something like this

- [02:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=8518) then something like this and okay okay currently from cache

- [02:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=8522) and okay okay currently from cache and in 15 seconds it should load

- [02:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=8549) okay cash is not expiring again yet i don't know why but

- [02:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=8599) okay now refresh it yeah now working okay anyway this is the

- [02:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=8602) now working okay anyway this is the output cache

- [02:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=8603) output cache and now we know it so let's go to the

- [02:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=8605) and now we know it so let's go to the next

- [02:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=8607) next and then there is another caching

- [02:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=8610) and then there is another caching methodology

- [02:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=8613) methodology in memory caching with imemory cache

- [02:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=8617) in memory caching with imemory cache as we saw in the previous article the

- [02:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=8619) as we saw in the previous article the concept of output cache was introduced

- [02:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=8621) concept of output cache was introduced in previous versions of the dot net

- [02:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=8623) in previous versions of the dot net framework

- [02:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=8623) framework and it's also supported in the net core

- [02:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=8626) and it's also supported in the net core framework through the use of a new get

- [02:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=8627) framework through the use of a new get package

- [02:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=8629) package however in net core 2.0 microsoft

- [02:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=8632) however in net core 2.0 microsoft introduced a more native approach to win

- [02:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=8634) introduced a more native approach to win memory caching with the microsoft

- [02:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=8636) memory caching with the microsoft extensions caching memory name space

- [02:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=8639) extensions caching memory name space yeah this looks better than the previous

- [02:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=8641) yeah this looks better than the previous one because previous one is

- [02:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=8643) one because previous one is not working as expected this means that

- [02:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=8645) not working as expected this means that you can now use caching on the server

- [02:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=8646) you can now use caching on the server natively

- [02:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=8647) natively without the use of nuget packages in

- [02:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=8649) without the use of nuget packages in your asp.net core projects

- [02:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=8652) your asp.net core projects this is most commonly done in your

- [02:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=8654) this is most commonly done in your controllers using dependency injection

- [02:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=8657) controllers using dependency injection so for instance if you want to use

- [02:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=8659) so for instance if you want to use caching in your home controller

- [02:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=8661) caching in your home controller you simply need to include the microsoft

- [02:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=8663) you simply need to include the microsoft extensions

- [02:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=8664) extensions caching memory namespace through a using

- [02:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=8667) caching memory namespace through a using statement and then

- [02:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=8667) statement and then inject the i memory cache service into

- [02:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=8669) inject the i memory cache service into the constructor of the controller

- [02:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=8672) the constructor of the controller here's an example okay so

- [02:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=8676) here's an example okay so let's add this caching to our lecture 12

- [02:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=8680) let's add this caching to our lecture 12 which is lecture time using years

- [02:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=8688) okay then we use dependency injection like here we have seen that in the

- [02:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=8689) like here we have seen that in the previous lectures

- [02:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=8692) previous lectures a private immemory cache

- [02:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=8695) a private immemory cache then we will

- [02:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=8701) overload the [Music]

- [02:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=8703) [Music] controllers i'm in the constructor like

- [02:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=8707) controllers i'm in the constructor like this

- [02:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=8708) this you see and now we can

- [02:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=8711) you see and now we can assign this member cache to cache okay

- [02:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=8716) assign this member cache to cache okay then you can now use the location object

- [02:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=8718) then you can now use the location object let's see

- [02:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=8723) you can now use the underscore memory cache object in your controller actions

- [02:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=8726) cache object in your controller actions it comes with several handy methods to

- [02:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=8728) it comes with several handy methods to cache objects and retrieve them again

- [02:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=8731) cache objects and retrieve them again this is also one of the main differences

- [02:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=8733) this is also one of the main differences between output cache

- [02:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=8734) between output cache and the i memory cache approach while

- [02:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=8736) and the i memory cache approach while the output cache was generally used to

- [02:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=8738) the output cache was generally used to cache the entire result of a controller

- [02:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=8740) cache the entire result of a controller method

- [02:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=8741) method i memory cache is generally used to

- [02:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=8743) i memory cache is generally used to store the objects needed to generate the

- [02:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=8745) store the objects needed to generate the result

- [02:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=8749) so for instance if you have a user controller with a details

- [02:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=8751) controller with a details method to display details about a user

- [02:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=8753) method to display details about a user from the database

- [02:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=8754) from the database the output cache approach would cache

- [02:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=8756) the output cache approach would cache the entire output of this method with

- [02:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=8757) the entire output of this method with imemory cache

- [02:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=8759) imemory cache you would instead cache the user object

- [02:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=8761) you would instead cache the user object and then use it to return the

- [02:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=8762) and then use it to return the appropriate view

- [02:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=8764) appropriate view in both situations you save the

- [02:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=8766) in both situations you save the potentially expensive database call

- [02:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=8768) potentially expensive database call but you get more control of the process

- [02:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=8770) but you get more control of the process with the imemory cache approach

- [02:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=8773) with the imemory cache approach just make sure that you remember the

- [02:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=8774) just make sure that you remember the following guidelines when using in

- [02:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=8776) following guidelines when using in memory caching

- [02:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=8778) memory caching don't assume that your objects are still

- [02:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=8780) don't assume that your objects are still in the cache make sure that you always

- [02:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=8782) in the cache make sure that you always check and provide code for re

- [02:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=8784) check and provide code for re filling the cache since in memory

- [02:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=8787) filling the cache since in memory caching uses the ram on your server to

- [02:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=8789) caching uses the ram on your server to store objects you should treat it as a

- [02:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=8791) store objects you should treat it as a scarce resource

- [02:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=8792) scarce resource and limit the amount and size of stuff

- [02:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=8793) and limit the amount and size of stuff you put into it

- [02:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=8796) you put into it you should also make sure to set an

- [02:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=8797) you should also make sure to set an expiration on the data you cache

- [02:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=8799) expiration on the data you cache so that the framework is allowed to

- [02:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=8801) so that the framework is allowed to remove stuff from the cache again once

- [02:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=8802) remove stuff from the cache again once it's not valid anymore

- [02:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=8805) it's not valid anymore the framework doesn't enforce any size

- [02:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=8807) the framework doesn't enforce any size slash memory limitations to your cache

- [02:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=8809) slash memory limitations to your cache you are required to do this manually

- [02:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=8811) you are required to do this manually using the set size size and size limit

- [02:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=8814) using the set size size and size limit properties slash methods

- [02:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=8815) properties slash methods if your use of the caching mechanism

- [02:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=8817) if your use of the caching mechanism goes beyond basic usage

- [02:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=8820) goes beyond basic usage with that in place let's try using the

- [02:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=8822) with that in place let's try using the memory cache here's a simple example

- [02:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=8825) memory cache here's a simple example okay so i am going to write another

- [02:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=8829) okay so i am going to write another method here such as

- [02:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=8833) method here such as lecture 10 okay memory

- [02:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=8836) lecture 10 okay memory cache and

- [02:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=8840) cache and we are going to

- [02:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=8847) use citrix cage daytime now and synchrated message one more cache

- [02:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=8851) and synchrated message one more cache and then okay it will be like this

- [02:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=8855) and then okay it will be like this yeah this will be inside the action

- [02:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=8857) yeah this will be inside the action actually not outside

- [02:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=8859) actually not outside so this is not cache

- [02:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=8863) so this is not cache this inside the memory as try get value

- [02:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=8867) this inside the memory as try get value outcasted message

- [02:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=8871) outcasted message and cache was refreshed

- [02:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=8874) and cache was refreshed and then if it is not available it will

- [02:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=8877) and then if it is not available it will set the cache

- [02:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=8891) setting item and then the patient measured message

- [02:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=8892) measured message okay so this takes an object

- [02:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=8895) okay so this takes an object and this is in key so the key

- [02:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=8903) okay let me check it object key and the value here

- [02:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=8905) value here so the key will be

- [02:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=8930) okay so this will be changed every minute because uh this returns

- [02:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=8934) because uh this returns the system date as

- [02:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=8937) the system date as uh up to minute and every minute this

- [02:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=8940) uh up to minute and every minute this will

- [02:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=8942) will cache the result and then change the

- [02:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=8946) cache the result and then change the cache

- [02:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=8948) cache because every minute key will change

- [02:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=8951) because every minute key will change let me show you what does this do

- [02:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=8963) i will put a breakpoint to show you what how the key is generated with this

- [02:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=8965) how the key is generated with this formatting

- [02:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=8967) formatting it will work as lecture 10 memory cache

- [02:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=8970) it will work as lecture 10 memory cache by the way like this okay so the key

- [02:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=8974) by the way like this okay so the key will be equal to uc

- [02:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=8977) will be equal to uc 2021 and zero five

- [02:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=8980) 2021 and zero five and twenty seven zero one which is my

- [02:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=8984) and twenty seven zero one which is my local date and 37 is the minute

- [02:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=8988) local date and 37 is the minute and since it doesn't exist on the cache

- [02:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=8991) and since it doesn't exist on the cache uh it will take three seconds then

- [02:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=8994) uh it will take three seconds then it will tell cache files requestion and

- [02:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=8997) it will tell cache files requestion and it will set the cache

- [02:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=8999) it will set the cache otherwise it will just return the cache

- [02:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=9002) otherwise it will just return the cache okay until we get into the uh

- [02:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=9006) okay until we get into the uh 38 okay now we're in the 38 it is

- [02:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=9009) 38 okay now we're in the 38 it is refreshing

- [02:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=9011) refreshing and now it will return from cash

- [02:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=9014) and now it will return from cash uh until it is 39 okay so

- [02:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=9017) uh until it is 39 okay so this is about caching objects in memory

- [02:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=9021) this is about caching objects in memory and accessing them from memory

- [02:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=9024) and accessing them from memory this is also native caching okay

- [02:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=9044) okay and let's continue reading yeah okay

- [02:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=9047) yeah okay explanation we still didn't set it

- [02:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=9051) explanation we still didn't set it you see it is available until the next

- [02:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=9053) you see it is available until the next minute

- [02:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=9054) minute actually they will available always

- [02:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=9057) actually they will available always because we didn't set

- [02:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=9058) because we didn't set expression cash expiration

- [02:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=9062) expression cash expiration as mentioned previously it's always a

- [02:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=9064) as mentioned previously it's always a good idea to set an expiration date time

- [02:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=9067) good idea to set an expiration date time on stuff you cash

- [02:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=9068) on stuff you cash if you don't it won't be removed from

- [02:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=9070) if you don't it won't be removed from the cash unless the application pool is

- [02:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=9073) the cash unless the application pool is recycled

- [02:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=9074) recycled and while that is okay for some use

- [02:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=9075) and while that is okay for some use cases most of your data should probably

- [02:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=9077) cases most of your data should probably expire sooner or later

- [02:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=9079) expire sooner or later so that it can be refreshed eg from the

- [02:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=9081) so that it can be refreshed eg from the database

- [02:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=9083) database fortunately for us asp.net makes it easy

- [02:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=9086) fortunately for us asp.net makes it easy for us to specify when cache data

- [02:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=9087) for us to specify when cache data should expire there are two types of

- [02:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=9090) should expire there are two types of expiration that you can set for your

- [02:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=9092) expiration that you can set for your cached entries

- [02:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=9093) cached entries sliding in absolute

- [02:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=9096) sliding in absolute sliding expiration a sliding expiration

- [02:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=9100) sliding expiration a sliding expiration will allow a cached entry to expire if

- [02:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=9102) will allow a cached entry to expire if it hasn't been accessed for a defined

- [02:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=9104) it hasn't been accessed for a defined amount of time

- [02:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=9105) amount of time a common usage for this would be to load

- [02:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=9107) a common usage for this would be to load something heavy and then set a sliding

- [02:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=9109) something heavy and then set a sliding expiration of eg 15 minutes

- [02:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=9112) expiration of eg 15 minutes each time the user accesses the data the

- [02:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=9114) each time the user accesses the data the expiration will be postponed

- [02:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=9116) expiration will be postponed allowing the user to keep on working

- [02:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=9117) allowing the user to keep on working with the data

- [02:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=9119) with the data however when 15 minutes have passed

- [02:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=9121) however when 15 minutes have passed without the user accessing the cash data

- [02:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=9123) without the user accessing the cash data it will expire and the resources will be

- [02:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=9125) it will expire and the resources will be freed

- [02:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=9127) freed in the next example i'll show you how to

- [02:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=9129) in the next example i'll show you how to set a sliding expiration

- [02:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=9131) set a sliding expiration it will be based on our first example in

- [02:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=9133) it will be based on our first example in this article but you'll notice that i

- [02:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=9135) this article but you'll notice that i use another approach for accessing slash

- [02:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=9137) use another approach for accessing slash filling the cache

- [02:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=9139) filling the cache the method is called get or create and

- [02:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=9141) the method is called get or create and it's very convenient you simply specify

- [02:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=9143) it's very convenient you simply specify a cache key

- [02:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=9144) a cache key and then a method for filling the cache

- [02:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=9146) and then a method for filling the cache in case nothing is found with the key

- [02:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=9149) in case nothing is found with the key the method will include a parameter

- [02:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=9150) the method will include a parameter which you can also use for specifying

- [02:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=9152) which you can also use for specifying options for the cache entry

- [02:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=9154) options for the cache entry and it will return the cached entry no

- [02:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=9156) and it will return the cached entry no matter if it's actually pulled from the

- [02:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=9157) matter if it's actually pulled from the cache right now

- [02:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=9158) cache right now or created instead here's how it looks

- [02:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=9162) or created instead here's how it looks okay uh this is also another example it

- [02:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=9165) okay uh this is also another example it is also pretty

- [02:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=9166) is also pretty easy so let's also

- [02:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=9170) easy so let's also do that we can also set this in our

- [02:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=9174) do that we can also set this in our lecture 13 actually

- [02:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=9176) lecture 13 actually so let's explain let it let's make it in

- [02:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=9179) so let's explain let it let's make it in lecture 13.

- [02:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=9180) lecture 13. okay lecture 13 sliding cache

- [02:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=9184) okay lecture 13 sliding cache like this okay and

- [02:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=9187) like this okay and by the way to be able to use it in the

- [02:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=9189) by the way to be able to use it in the sliding in the lecture 13

- [02:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=9192) sliding in the lecture 13 i have to copy and paste uh

- [02:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=9196) i have to copy and paste uh the same things

- [02:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=9202) like this we have private eye memory cache

- [02:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=9203) cache and we are going to do a dependency

- [02:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=9206) and we are going to do a dependency injection

- [02:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=9208) injection like here let me show you

- [02:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=9215) like here let me show you okay by the way we will take them into

- [02:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=9219) okay by the way we will take them into the

- [02:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=9220) the proper correct class here

- [02:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=9223) proper correct class here and let's just turn controller here and

- [02:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=9227) and let's just turn controller here and now it will work

- [02:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=9236) okay this is dependency injection and here we have sliding cache

- [02:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=9240) and here we have sliding cache let's fill inside of it like this

- [02:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=9244) let's fill inside of it like this okay so what does this going to do is it

- [02:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=9248) okay so what does this going to do is it will

- [02:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=9249) will generate a key based on the date

- [02:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=9252) generate a key based on the date uh we can also set a specific cache as

- [02:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=9255) uh we can also set a specific cache as well like

- [02:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=9257) well like my date cache so you won't get

- [02:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=9261) my date cache so you won't get confused or date

- [02:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=9264) confused or date cache key and it will

- [02:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=9267) cache key and it will use get or create with

- [02:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=9270) use get or create with a simulation of three seconds and it

- [02:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=9273) a simulation of three seconds and it will set

- [02:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=9274) will set sliding expression so the entry

- [02:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=9277) sliding expression so the entry is the i catch entry that we are

- [02:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=9280) is the i catch entry that we are generating

- [02:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=9281) generating if it is not available if it is

- [02:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=9283) if it is not available if it is available it will just get the cached

- [02:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=9285) available it will just get the cached message

- [02:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=9286) message or not so let's make this refreshing

- [02:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=9289) or not so let's make this refreshing every 15 seconds

- [02:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=9299) okay so this will be the url to access it that we

- [02:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=9300) it that we did set

- [02:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=9311) and after 15 seconds the cache will be removed from the memory

- [02:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=9313) cache will be removed from the memory therefore it will get refreshed

- [02:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=9315) therefore it will get refreshed so the first time it is taking three

- [02:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=9317) so the first time it is taking three seconds to load

- [02:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=9319) seconds to load then okay after

- [02:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=9322) then okay after three seconds is fill the refresh again

- [02:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=9324) three seconds is fill the refresh again 15 seconds

- [02:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=9326) 15 seconds okay in a moment

- [02:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=9342) by the way we can see the seconds oh since this is sliding uh explanation

- [02:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=9346) oh since this is sliding uh explanation then and we are requesting it

- [02:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=9349) then and we are requesting it frequently it never expires so

- [02:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=9352) frequently it never expires so not too long thing but just now

- [02:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=9355) not too long thing but just now to see the second as well so i have to

- [02:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=9358) to see the second as well so i have to wait

- [02:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=9365) uh 15 seconds by the way there is no this okay because it is not a method

- [02:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=9368) this okay because it is not a method it's a struct okay to uh

- [02:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=9371) it's a struct okay to uh let it expire i have to wait 15 seconds

- [02:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=9374) let it expire i have to wait 15 seconds before i refresh the page and access it

- [02:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=9383) again okay so the first time it is generating key

- [02:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=9386) so the first time it is generating key okay uh 21 seconds oh it is still not

- [02:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=9390) okay uh 21 seconds oh it is still not showing this second

- [02:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=9391) showing this second anyway okay let's

- [02:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=9394) anyway okay let's just also add seconds

- [02:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=9437) okay so let's refresh i mean sorry about that

- [02:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=9450) name is yeah okay first time load okay 25 seconds it is cached

- [02:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=9454) okay 25 seconds it is cached and as long as i refresh it will never

- [02:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=9457) and as long as i refresh it will never expire so let's wait 15 seconds

- [02:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=9477) okay now let's refresh it okay now getting refreshed okay now

- [02:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=9479) okay now getting refreshed okay now refresh it

- [02:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=9481) refresh it now we can wait 15 seconds as well okay

- [02:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=9484) now we can wait 15 seconds as well okay this is the way it works

- [02:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=9487) this is the way it works so this was sliding expression we can

- [02:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=9489) so this was sliding expression we can also set

- [02:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=9491) also set absolute expression like let's also set

- [02:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=9494) absolute expression like let's also set it like this

- [02:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=9495) it like this so it won't be affected by the

- [02:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=9499) so it won't be affected by the sets absolute expression it won't be

- [02:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=9502) sets absolute expression it won't be affected by the

- [02:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=9504) affected by the refreshing so let's also test that

- [02:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=9513) by the way i think sliding expression is based on any users not just you

- [02:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=9536) slide the cache first time loads now i will keep refreshing and in 15

- [02:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=9539) now i will keep refreshing and in 15 seconds

- [02:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=9540) seconds it will refresh again because we did set

- [02:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=9543) it will refresh again because we did set absolute

- [02:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=9544) absolute cash

- [02:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=9551) okay let's catch it catch it okay now refreshing

- [02:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=9554) refreshing yeah all right

- [02:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=9558) yeah all right and yeah

- [02:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=9565) and yeah and working with databases actually we

- [02:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24nuva9dkU&t=9567) and working with databases actually we are all we have already working with
