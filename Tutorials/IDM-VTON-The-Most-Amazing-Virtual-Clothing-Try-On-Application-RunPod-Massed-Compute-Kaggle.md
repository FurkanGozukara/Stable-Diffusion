### Video Transcription


- [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeHfgq_lAXU&t=0) Greetings everyone. Today I am going to introduce&nbsp; you the newest Virtual Try On application that&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeHfgq_lAXU&t=8) has never been seen like. This application is able&nbsp; to transfer literally anything with one click.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeHfgq_lAXU&t=16) You see, I did put the image of the Elon Musk. Let&nbsp; me remove the mask that I have made and I used&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeHfgq_lAXU&t=24) this image as a input reference to transfer&nbsp; the clothing and you see it has transferred.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeHfgq_lAXU&t=30) It can transfer even the hair of the Brad Pitt&nbsp; into my own DreamBooth generated image and you see&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeHfgq_lAXU&t=38) the hair is transferred to me. Let me undo and&nbsp; this was my original hair as you are seeing.

- [00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeHfgq_lAXU&t=44) It can transfer the clothing of the people. You&nbsp; see the input image is like this and this is the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeHfgq_lAXU&t=51) clothing reference, and we got the output image.&nbsp; And of course, it can also transfer any clothing&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeHfgq_lAXU&t=58) that you give like this. So today I am going to&nbsp; show you how to install and use this application&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeHfgq_lAXU&t=63) on Massed Compute which is extremely cheap,&nbsp; only 31 cents per hour for RTX A6000 GPU. I'm&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeHfgq_lAXU&t=71) also going to show that how to install and use it&nbsp; on RunPod. However, RunPod is not working as good&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeHfgq_lAXU&t=78) as Massed Compute but you will see how to install&nbsp; and use it. And finally, I'm going to show you how&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeHfgq_lAXU&t=84) you can use it on a free Kaggle notebook without&nbsp; paying any money to the GPU. If you are wondering&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeHfgq_lAXU&t=90) how you can install and use it on your computer,&nbsp; we already have a one-click installer for Windows.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeHfgq_lAXU&t=97) You are seeing right now we already have a&nbsp; tutorial for that. Actually, I suggest you watch&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeHfgq_lAXU&t=103) that tutorial first, then watch this one. When you&nbsp; go to our channel and when you go to our videos,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeHfgq_lAXU&t=111) you will see that this is the tutorial that I made&nbsp; for Windows. So in this tutorial, I will begin with&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeHfgq_lAXU&t=117) showing first Massed Compute, then I am going to&nbsp; show you RunPod, and then Kaggle. If you look at&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeHfgq_lAXU&t=124) the description of this video, you will find the&nbsp; video chapters when they are starting, but you&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeHfgq_lAXU&t=129) can watch the entire video if you prefer. So all&nbsp; the scripts to install everything automatically&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeHfgq_lAXU&t=137) on RunPod, Massed Compute, and use on Kaggle is&nbsp; included in this attached zip file. It is at the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeHfgq_lAXU&t=145) bottom of the post. Go here, the link of this&nbsp; post will be in the description of the video,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeHfgq_lAXU&t=150) then extract it anywhere that you want. I am&nbsp; extracting here like this and here are all&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeHfgq_lAXU&t=155) the installers. So how are we going to use it?&nbsp; First, I will begin with Massed Compute. So open&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeHfgq_lAXU&t=162) Massed Compute instructions.txt file. You will&nbsp; get the instructions like this. First of all,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeHfgq_lAXU&t=167) we need to register and start our Massed Compute&nbsp; instance. Currently, I am registered so I just&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeHfgq_lAXU&t=174) logged into my account. To register, please use&nbsp; this link, it is super important, and then we will&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeHfgq_lAXU&t=180) use my coupon to get very cheap prices. On this&nbsp; screen, go to the deploy menu and in here select&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeHfgq_lAXU&t=187) A6000 GPU. So there are two A6000 GPUs. You see&nbsp; alt config and A6000. Alt config has lesser RAM,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeHfgq_lAXU&t=197) so you will encounter problems with many of the&nbsp; scripts, so I don't suggest it. Use A6000, this&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeHfgq_lAXU&t=203) one has 48 GB GPU. Then from the category, select&nbsp; creator, from the image, select SECourses and then&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeHfgq_lAXU&t=212) use our coupon. This will make the price half.&nbsp; Click verify, you will see that this amazing,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeHfgq_lAXU&t=219) very powerful GPU A6000 is only 31 cents per hour.&nbsp; This is amazing. Then click deploy. Then you will&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeHfgq_lAXU&t=227) get to this page and we will wait for our machine&nbsp; to be started. We need to use ThinLinc client&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeHfgq_lAXU&t=234) to connect to our remote machine. Click here if&nbsp; you haven't installed it yet. Download according&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeHfgq_lAXU&t=240) to your operating system. I am on Windows, so&nbsp; download this one. It is so simple to install.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeHfgq_lAXU&t=245) Double-click, then click yes, next, install,&nbsp; next, that's all, and then just run ThinLinc&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeHfgq_lAXU&t=253) client. And now this screen is very important.&nbsp; Click advanced to open these advanced tabs,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeHfgq_lAXU&t=258) click options. In here, go to the local devices.&nbsp; In here you will see drives, click details, and in&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeHfgq_lAXU&t=265) here we are going to add a folder to synchronize&nbsp; between our computer and the remote machine.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeHfgq_lAXU&t=271) Click add. From here, it wants you to pick a&nbsp; folder. I am going to pick a folder inside my R&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeHfgq_lAXU&t=278) drive. Inside here I have a Massed Compute folder&nbsp; which is here massed compute. Click okay, then make it read and&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeHfgq_lAXU&t=286) write if you want to synchronize folders in both&nbsp; ways. Click okay, click okay. Then wait for this&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeHfgq_lAXU&t=293) initializing status to be initialized. The machine&nbsp; is started. You see now the status is running.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeHfgq_lAXU&t=300) So copy this link like this, paste it here. Be&nbsp; aware that the 300 port is not written here,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeHfgq_lAXU&t=307) it is just written like an IP like this. Copy&nbsp; the password and paste it here. You see the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeHfgq_lAXU&t=313) username is ubuntu and ubuntu, and then click&nbsp; connect. Then click continue. If you select&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeHfgq_lAXU&t=319) this "End existing session", it will restart your&nbsp; machine, so don't select it unless you needed it.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeHfgq_lAXU&t=324) It may be needed in some rare cases, like your&nbsp; drive is not synchronizing. Then click start&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeHfgq_lAXU&t=330) here. Then just wait a little bit, it is pretty&nbsp; fast. Massed Compute machines are really, really&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeHfgq_lAXU&t=336) great. Then the machine is started and we are&nbsp; connected to our machine. You see it has a desktop&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeHfgq_lAXU&t=341) interface like we are using on our computer.&nbsp; So then when we go to the home and inside here,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeHfgq_lAXU&t=348) we will see the thindrives, and in here you&nbsp; see my folder from my local computer is here.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeHfgq_lAXU&t=355) Double-click it and you will see the installer&nbsp; files that we did put inside there. How did you&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeHfgq_lAXU&t=361) put? So from this, copy Massed Compute install&nbsp; files. Copy them, go to your drive where you&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeHfgq_lAXU&t=369) set for synchronization. In here I have a Massed&nbsp; Compute, delete them. So after I deleted them,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeHfgq_lAXU&t=376) you will see that they will disappear because it&nbsp; will be synchronized. Then I will put them again&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeHfgq_lAXU&t=381) like this. Put the latest version. Then when you&nbsp; F5 and refresh it, it should arrive. Yes, okay.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeHfgq_lAXU&t=388) Then copy these two. Select, copy, right-click,&nbsp; make a new folder on the desktop. So new folder,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeHfgq_lAXU&t=395) let's say vton_ai and click okay. When you&nbsp; get this software update, just click cancel,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeHfgq_lAXU&t=402) you don't need it, and then double-click. This&nbsp; virtual machine is amazing. We have by default&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeHfgq_lAXU&t=408) Python 3.10, so all of the AI applications&nbsp; work. Then paste the files inside this new&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeHfgq_lAXU&t=414) folder. Double-click and open the instructions,&nbsp; select the installer command like this and copy.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeHfgq_lAXU&t=421) Then return back to the folder and click these&nbsp; three dots icon, click open terminal, paste it,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeHfgq_lAXU&t=427) and it will automatically install everything for&nbsp; us. Just relax and wait for the installation to be&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeHfgq_lAXU&t=433) completed. So the installation has been completed.&nbsp; You see successfully installed the latest library&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeHfgq_lAXU&t=439) and the installation is ended. You can scroll up&nbsp; and check whether there are any errors or not.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeHfgq_lAXU&t=446) This is really, really important for you to check&nbsp; if any error occurred or not, but you see there&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeHfgq_lAXU&t=451) are no errors. It was a perfect installation. Then&nbsp; return back to instructions and copy this part.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeHfgq_lAXU&t=458) This is where we will start the virtual try-on&nbsp; application. We are going to execute this command&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeHfgq_lAXU&t=465) inside this folder you see where we have copied the&nbsp; installation files. Open a new terminal here, just&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeHfgq_lAXU&t=472) paste the command that you have copied, and it&nbsp; will start the application for us. When you first&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeHfgq_lAXU&t=479) time run it, it will download necessary models&nbsp; automatically. Then it will not download. So you&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeHfgq_lAXU&t=486) see, on Massed Compute, you can use it either on&nbsp; the local URL like this, or you can use it with&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeHfgq_lAXU&t=491) the Gradio live share. Currently, the locally&nbsp; installed browser is Firefox. Firefox is not&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeHfgq_lAXU&t=499) the best one to use. Google Chrome is working best&nbsp; with Gradio applications, so I am going to use it&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeHfgq_lAXU&t=505) on my computer. Moreover, due to Gradio bugs,&nbsp; these examples may not work, so I suggest you&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeHfgq_lAXU&t=512) upload your own images. I am going to copy this&nbsp; URL. I am returning back to my computer, paste it.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeHfgq_lAXU&t=519) To use this on your computer, you don't need any&nbsp; hardware. This is running on Massed Compute, not&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeHfgq_lAXU&t=525) on my computer. Then to upload your initial image,&nbsp; click this icon, not here. Here is not working&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeHfgq_lAXU&t=530) because this is a special image editor. Click this&nbsp; icon, upload your initial image. Then upload the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeHfgq_lAXU&t=538) clothing that you want to merge. You see, it is&nbsp; very robust. It even works with these kinds of&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeHfgq_lAXU&t=544) images. Describe it, full plate armor, and click&nbsp; try on. Now some people are getting confused with&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeHfgq_lAXU&t=552) "Open outputs folder". The "Open outputs folder"&nbsp; will work only on desktop operating systems,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeHfgq_lAXU&t=559) so it will not work when you are using&nbsp; Gradio live share on your personal computer,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeHfgq_lAXU&t=564) or when you are using the our application on RunPod or&nbsp; on Kaggle. If you are using it on your computer,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeHfgq_lAXU&t=571) it will work. Moreover, it should work when we&nbsp; are running it on the local URL inside the Massed&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeHfgq_lAXU&t=579) Compute. I will show in a moment once this image&nbsp; is generated. Since we are running it first time,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeHfgq_lAXU&t=585) it is downloading the necessary models as you&nbsp; are seeing with a great speed, 100 megabytes&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeHfgq_lAXU&t=591) per second. So it is almost 1 gigabit per&nbsp; second. After models have been downloaded,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeHfgq_lAXU&t=596) we got the output image. So you see, since I have&nbsp; selected auto-generated mask and auto cropping,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeHfgq_lAXU&t=602) it cropped and generated this mask, and according&nbsp; to this mask, this is the output I have got. I&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeHfgq_lAXU&t=609) can mask the entire image and generate again. I&nbsp; have a long tutorial regarding this that I have&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeHfgq_lAXU&t=616) shown when I am making the tutorial for Windows,&nbsp; so watch this tutorial to see how to use this&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeHfgq_lAXU&t=623) application with more features. However, it is an&nbsp; amazing application. It is very robust and you can&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeHfgq_lAXU&t=630) even change the hair, you can even change other&nbsp; features. So it is up to your imagination how to&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeHfgq_lAXU&t=637) use it. So when I click this button, it won't work&nbsp; because this is not working on my computer. If I&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeHfgq_lAXU&t=643) return back to here, refresh this page and click&nbsp; this "Open outputs folder", you see the outputs&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeHfgq_lAXU&t=651) folder is opened inside Massed Compute. So this&nbsp; is where, by default, all the images are saved.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeHfgq_lAXU&t=659) Due to the nature of Gradio, if you encounter any&nbsp; errors, refresh the page and try again. Moreover,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeHfgq_lAXU&t=666) when you click this "Try on" button, it will not&nbsp; regenerate the image because of a bug of Gradio.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeHfgq_lAXU&t=673) I have reported that and hopefully, it will be&nbsp; fixed. So how you are going to solve this issue?&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeHfgq_lAXU&t=678) Click this icon, put a dot here, then click this&nbsp; undo icon and click "Try on", and it will start&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeHfgq_lAXU&t=684) generating again. You see, I had to click double&nbsp; times because this is also a bug of Gradio, but it&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeHfgq_lAXU&t=690) is working and hopefully, all of these errors will&nbsp; be fixed. So I have generated 10 images by using&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeHfgq_lAXU&t=698) "Number of images to generate" and you will see&nbsp; that each image is widely different because of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeHfgq_lAXU&t=705) seed. The seed makes a huge difference. And how&nbsp; can you download them to your computer? You can&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeHfgq_lAXU&t=711) either download one by one by clicking here, or a&nbsp; better way is to go to the outputs folder here. So&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeHfgq_lAXU&t=719) I will just copy the outputs folder and I will&nbsp; return back to the Massed Compute folder where&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeHfgq_lAXU&t=726) I am synchronizing with my computer. So it is&nbsp; inside home, click home, click thin drives,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeHfgq_lAXU&t=733) and enter inside Massed Compute. This is my folder&nbsp; name, you can give any name. Paste it there. This&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeHfgq_lAXU&t=738) is inside the remote cloud machine. Then when I&nbsp; return back to my own computer, you will see the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeHfgq_lAXU&t=746) outputs folder gets synchronized like this. So all&nbsp; the images I have generated on Massed Compute will&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeHfgq_lAXU&t=753) be synchronized to my local computer. And now it&nbsp; is time to install the virtual try-on on RunPod.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeHfgq_lAXU&t=762) So for RunPod, open the RunPod instructions.txt&nbsp; file. Please use my register link, I appreciate&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeHfgq_lAXU&t=769) that, so that I can get more credits to do more&nbsp; tutorials for you. Log in to your account after&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeHfgq_lAXU&t=775) registered, enter your credits, and then go to the&nbsp; pods, click deploy. From here, select community&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeHfgq_lAXU&t=782) cloud or secure cloud according to your needs.&nbsp; I am using community cloud, much better for me,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeHfgq_lAXU&t=788) extreme speed. And now I will show you very&nbsp; crucial settings. I select NVME for faster disk&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeHfgq_lAXU&t=796) and I select 48 gigabytes to get a good machine.&nbsp; So these are the settings that I use. Then select&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeHfgq_lAXU&t=803) your GPU according to your speed need. 4090 is&nbsp; extremely fast, or you can use 3090 as well,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeHfgq_lAXU&t=811) depending on your budget. So I will go with 4090.&nbsp; And from here, select your template type, PyTorch,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeHfgq_lAXU&t=818) like this, and you will get these templates.&nbsp; Select 2.1, it doesn't matter. Then edit your&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeHfgq_lAXU&t=824) template and set your volume disk. Let's set 50&nbsp; gigabytes. And you can also add proxy connection,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeHfgq_lAXU&t=831) so the proxy connection port will be 7861, like&nbsp; this. Set overrides and click deploy on demand.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeHfgq_lAXU&t=838) Then go to "My Pods", wait for the connect button&nbsp; to appear here. I have amazing tutorials for&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeHfgq_lAXU&t=844) RunPod on my channel. Let me show you some of&nbsp; them. So on our channel, click this search icon&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeHfgq_lAXU&t=850) and type RunPod, and you will get all the amazing&nbsp; RunPod tutorials that I have. And by watching&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeHfgq_lAXU&t=856) these tutorials, you can learn how to use RunPod&nbsp; very well. Moreover, I have an excellent tutorial&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeHfgq_lAXU&t=862) where I have explained how to use Massed Compute&nbsp; in more detail. It is inside this one, "Trainer&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeHfgq_lAXU&t=868) Tutorial". It is over two hours. You can also&nbsp; watch the relevant parts of this tutorial. In my&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeHfgq_lAXU&t=873) old tutorials, I have extremely well and detailed&nbsp; video sections, video chapters, like this. So&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeHfgq_lAXU&t=880) you can read my descriptions to find wherever you&nbsp; want to watch and learn. So the connect button of&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeHfgq_lAXU&t=887) RunPod appeared. Click connect, go to the Jupyter&nbsp; Lab. Once the Jupyter Lab interface is loaded,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeHfgq_lAXU&t=893) we are going to upload files. Okay, to upload&nbsp; files, you can use this icon, select the folder&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeHfgq_lAXU&t=898) where you have extracted files. I'm going to&nbsp; upload everything because it is just easier,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeHfgq_lAXU&t=902) but you can also upload only RunPod files. Click&nbsp; RunPod instructions.txt, copy this with Ctrl+C,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeHfgq_lAXU&t=909) plus icon, terminal, paste the command, hit&nbsp; enter, and just wait. And let's see the speed&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeHfgq_lAXU&t=915) of this machine. Because of the settings that I&nbsp; have made, I got a very fast machine. You see,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeHfgq_lAXU&t=922) 4 gigabits download, 4 gigabits upload, amazing&nbsp; speeds machine, this one. So the installation&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeHfgq_lAXU&t=927) and download should be pretty fast. Just wait. So&nbsp; the installation of RunPod is also completed. Then&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeHfgq_lAXU&t=934) return back to the instructions file, copy this&nbsp; link, open a new terminal like this, paste it,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeHfgq_lAXU&t=940) hit enter, and it should automatically start the&nbsp; application. First time when we generate an image,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeHfgq_lAXU&t=948) it will download necessary models onto RunPod.&nbsp; Moreover, if you are using an Ubuntu computer,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeHfgq_lAXU&t=955) you should use the automatic installers for&nbsp; Massed Compute. It is more compatible with Linux&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeHfgq_lAXU&t=962) machines than the RunPod installers. Currently&nbsp; we are waiting for it to generate gradio share;&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeHfgq_lAXU&t=968) however, it is not an issue. We can go back&nbsp; to my pods, click connect, and connect to&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeHfgq_lAXU&t=972) the http service port 7861. You see, because our&nbsp; application started by default on 7860 port and,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeHfgq_lAXU&t=983) moreover, you see that the gradio share failed&nbsp; because of the Gradio server problem. However,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeHfgq_lAXU&t=991) we should be able to connect from the proxy,&nbsp; and yes, we connected from the proxy of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeHfgq_lAXU&t=996) RunPod. So, let's just upload our example image&nbsp; like this, then just upload clothing like this,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeHfgq_lAXU&t=1003) and let's say a full-scale armor. Let's generate&nbsp; 10 images with random seed. Seed makes a huge&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeHfgq_lAXU&t=1011) difference. Click try on, and since this is the&nbsp; first time, it will download all the models,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeHfgq_lAXU&t=1016) and you see this machine has a huge speed for&nbsp; download. It is downloading with like over one&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeHfgq_lAXU&t=1022) gigabit per second. Meanwhile, still downloading&nbsp; models, the gradio interface gave an error;&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeHfgq_lAXU&t=1030) however, this is not an issue because it will&nbsp; continue to download models and generate images,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeHfgq_lAXU&t=1036) and the images will be saved inside the&nbsp; outputs folder. But this is an issue when&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeHfgq_lAXU&t=1041) you use RunPod. RunPod recently has been having&nbsp; huge issues with the Gradio. I reported them these&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeHfgq_lAXU&t=1048) issues multiple times, but they still&nbsp; didn't fix it. So, unlike on Massed Compute,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeHfgq_lAXU&t=1053) you will have a lot of Gradio-related issues when&nbsp; you are using RunPod, unfortunately. So, all the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeHfgq_lAXU&t=1058) images are generated. They are saved inside&nbsp; the outputs folder. Let's see them. You see,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeHfgq_lAXU&t=1064) I can double-click and open each one of them as I&nbsp; want. Moreover, how can I download them? You can&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeHfgq_lAXU&t=1069) select all of them, right-click and download. You&nbsp; see, it is asking me to allow multiple downloads.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeHfgq_lAXU&t=1075) Allow them. Alternatively, a better way is you&nbsp; can right-click the outputs and download as an&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeHfgq_lAXU&t=1081) archive, or you can download them with runpodctl.&nbsp; If you don't know how to use runpodctl, I&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeHfgq_lAXU&t=1087) have a tutorial for that. You see, runpodctl send&nbsp; outputs like this. It will give me this URL. Copy&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeHfgq_lAXU&t=1094) it, then go wherever you want to download. Let's&nbsp; download inside this folder. For this to work,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeHfgq_lAXU&t=1099) you need to have runpodctl installed on your&nbsp; computer, and it will download all the images&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeHfgq_lAXU&t=1106) very fast like this. Then we can return back to&nbsp; our Gradio. Currently, there is a bug in gradio,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeHfgq_lAXU&t=1112) so when I click try on, it will not work.&nbsp; However, I will put a change here and undo,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeHfgq_lAXU&t=1117) then click try on again, and this time it will&nbsp; start generating the image again. So this is a&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeHfgq_lAXU&t=1124) bug of gradio. I have reported that, and&nbsp; hopefully, it will be fixed soon, and we&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeHfgq_lAXU&t=1128) should get the image here this time. So let's see&nbsp; the process here. For some reason, yeah, yeah,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeHfgq_lAXU&t=1135) currently our Gradio is bugged. Okay, it started.&nbsp; I don't know why, but it takes some time. Okay,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeHfgq_lAXU&t=1141) the speed of RTX 4090 is amazing. It only takes&nbsp; about five seconds to generate one image, but&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeHfgq_lAXU&t=1149) currently, this Gradio is not working accurately.&nbsp; This is why RunPod is problematic recently. The&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeHfgq_lAXU&t=1155) image is generated, but we don't see the image&nbsp; here, and they still didn't fix their RunPod proxy&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeHfgq_lAXU&t=1162) system. So we don't get the image, unfortunately.&nbsp; Let's refresh this screen again to see. Okay,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeHfgq_lAXU&t=1168) let's try again quickly. Let's upload our images&nbsp; and let's just type full body armor and try again.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeHfgq_lAXU&t=1176) So this is totally related to the Gradio and the&nbsp; RunPod proxy. Yes, it is taking a huge time for&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeHfgq_lAXU&t=1183) gradio to connect to the server, send the task,&nbsp; and get back. It is working really slow. Moreover,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeHfgq_lAXU&t=1191) when you get a Gradio live link on RunPod, it is&nbsp; working better than the proxy because of the proxy&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeHfgq_lAXU&t=1197) system of RunPod. Yes, this time we are getting&nbsp; 5.3 it per second. It takes only five seconds,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeHfgq_lAXU&t=1203) and we got the image on RunPod, and when you click&nbsp; open outputs folder here, it won't work. Okay,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeHfgq_lAXU&t=1209) now it is time to start using Kaggle. For Kaggle,&nbsp; we got the Kaggle virtual try-on notebook. Go to&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeHfgq_lAXU&t=1217) Kaggle.com, then log in and register, and&nbsp; verify your phone number to be able to use&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeHfgq_lAXU&t=1224) the GPUs on Kaggle. Then click create, and in&nbsp; this screen, we are going to first select the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeHfgq_lAXU&t=1231) accelerator. This is super important. Select GPU&nbsp; T4 x2. This is a faster GPU. Then make sure that&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeHfgq_lAXU&t=1238) internet is on here, then click file, click import&nbsp; notebook, click browse files, go to the downloads,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeHfgq_lAXU&t=1246) and select the Kaggle notebook file like&nbsp; this. I see that I have a naming error,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeHfgq_lAXU&t=1251) but it is not important. So you will get to this&nbsp; screen. So how to make it work? It is so easy.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeHfgq_lAXU&t=1258) First of all, we need to start our session.&nbsp; Wait that this appears. Once it has appeared,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeHfgq_lAXU&t=1264) click start session. You see, it was invisible,&nbsp; so I just zoomed it out so that it is now visible.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeHfgq_lAXU&t=1271) You really need to read the descriptions that I have write on my Kaggle notebooks so that you will be able to&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeHfgq_lAXU&t=1278) run them very well. And you see, I have 30 hours&nbsp; of free GPU usage for this week, and it is weekly,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeHfgq_lAXU&t=1285) so you can use it 120 hours per month. It is&nbsp; a huge time to use. So click this play icon.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeHfgq_lAXU&t=1292) It will install everything automatically for us.&nbsp; Just wait for this cell execution to be stopped.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeHfgq_lAXU&t=1300) Once this cell execution is stopped, it means&nbsp; that installation has been completed, and you&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeHfgq_lAXU&t=1304) can move forward. So, the installation has been&nbsp; completed. You see there is not any more cancel&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeHfgq_lAXU&t=1311) button, and when you scroll down, you will see the&nbsp; installation progress like this. You will also get&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeHfgq_lAXU&t=1318) these pip installation confliction error. It is&nbsp; not important, and at the very bottom, you will&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeHfgq_lAXU&t=1325) see that the installation has been completed.&nbsp; Let me show you in a second. You will also get&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeHfgq_lAXU&t=1331) this dependency resolver. It is not important, and&nbsp; here, so you see it was completed. So this part,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeHfgq_lAXU&t=1339) you need to get a token and do something special&nbsp; to use the Gradio interface on Kaggle. Kaggle is&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeHfgq_lAXU&t=1346) still not allowing us to use Gradio directly;&nbsp; therefore, I am not going to show this section&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeHfgq_lAXU&t=1352) on the video, but necessary instructions and an&nbsp; unlisted video are here. Just read this part and&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeHfgq_lAXU&t=1361) watch that video if you can't make it work.&nbsp; Once you follow the instructions and got your&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeHfgq_lAXU&t=1367) link above, you just need to execute this cell to&nbsp; start the virtual try-on. You see, we are using&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeHfgq_lAXU&t=1374) 8-bit mode, which has arrived recently. So with&nbsp; this 8-bit mode, we are able to use the virtual&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeHfgq_lAXU&t=1380) try-on on the free Kaggle notebook. Otherwise, we&nbsp; weren't able to use it. So this is our work, and&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeHfgq_lAXU&t=1387) this is a huge work. If you use the default Gradio&nbsp; demo that they provide with the default libraries,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeHfgq_lAXU&t=1394) you won't be able to run this on Kaggle. And the&nbsp; application started on the local URL. However,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeHfgq_lAXU&t=1399) this will not work. You need to click the&nbsp; above link that you have got by following the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeHfgq_lAXU&t=1406) instructions above. Now, I am going to connect to&nbsp; it. So once you opened that link, click visit site,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeHfgq_lAXU&t=1412) and you will get this virtual try-on interface.&nbsp; The usage is the same on Kaggle, on RunPod,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeHfgq_lAXU&t=1419) on Massed Compute, on Windows. We just upload&nbsp; our image. Let's upload our image like this. This&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeHfgq_lAXU&t=1427) time, let's upload something else. Let's try&nbsp; this clothing. Let's say a t-shirt like this,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeHfgq_lAXU&t=1433) and let's generate five images and click try on.&nbsp; Same as the other platforms, when you first time&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeHfgq_lAXU&t=1439) generate an image, it will download all the models&nbsp; automatically for you. You see, the download speed&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeHfgq_lAXU&t=1445) of Kaggle is the best among all others, 250&nbsp; megabytes per second. It is over two gigabits&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeHfgq_lAXU&t=1452) per second. So the models have been downloaded,&nbsp; and it started generating the image. However,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeHfgq_lAXU&t=1458) Kaggle will be the slowest one among others. Each&nbsp; image generation will take a huge time compared&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeHfgq_lAXU&t=1465) to RunPod or Massed Compute because of the free&nbsp; GPUs that we get on Kaggle. So you see, on Kaggle,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeHfgq_lAXU&t=1473) it is taking 40 seconds for one image. With RunPod&nbsp; RTX 4090, it takes five seconds for one image,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeHfgq_lAXU&t=1481) and on Massed Compute, it takes only 10 seconds&nbsp; for one image with the very cheap GPU. So this is&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeHfgq_lAXU&t=1489) the difference between all platforms. If you use&nbsp; the free one, you get slower generation speed.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeHfgq_lAXU&t=1496) That is how it works. If you ask my opinion,&nbsp; the best one is using Massed Compute. However,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeHfgq_lAXU&t=1503) you can also use RunPod as well, or you can use&nbsp; Kaggle as well. You see, it is generating right&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeHfgq_lAXU&t=1509) now. It is taking about 40 seconds, 42 seconds&nbsp; for one image, but you see the gradio is working&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeHfgq_lAXU&t=1516) much better on Kaggle because RunPod is having so&nbsp; many issues with gradio. Also, on Massed Compute,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeHfgq_lAXU&t=1523) gradio is working great, no issues. So we just&nbsp; need to wait. I am now generating five images to&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeHfgq_lAXU&t=1529) see them. So the images have been generated. We&nbsp; can see them like this. Of course, this t-shirt&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeHfgq_lAXU&t=1535) is hard to make with this pose because it is&nbsp; not compatible, as you are seeing. So you need&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeHfgq_lAXU&t=1543) to use another image if you want to get, let's&nbsp; try, for example, this one. This will be much&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeHfgq_lAXU&t=1549) more compatible. This is how you can use it with&nbsp; the virtual try-on. You need to have a compatible&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeHfgq_lAXU&t=1556) clothing image and also input image. However, it&nbsp; is working perfectly fine. The rest is up to you&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeHfgq_lAXU&t=1563) to figure out the best settings, parameters,&nbsp; and best way to use. So how you can download&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeHfgq_lAXU&t=1569) the generated images on Kaggle? To download them,&nbsp; you can use several options. First of all, you can&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeHfgq_lAXU&t=1575) click this icon to expand these folders like this,&nbsp; and you will get the outputs folder here. Click to&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeHfgq_lAXU&t=1584) expand it, and you can download every image one&nbsp; by one. You see, download, download, like this,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeHfgq_lAXU&t=1591) and then you can use the output here on gradio&nbsp; to download them. Let's wait for the image to&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeHfgq_lAXU&t=1596) be completed. Okay, we got the output. It is much&nbsp; better than the previous one. So just click here&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeHfgq_lAXU&t=1602) to download the image one by one. Alternatively,&nbsp; you can download all of them. To download all of&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeHfgq_lAXU&t=1608) them, click cancel run because you cannot execute&nbsp; two cells at the same time. Then click here,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeHfgq_lAXU&t=1615) this icon. This will zip all of the images for&nbsp; you in to the. The output will be inside the Kaggle working,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeHfgq_lAXU&t=1623) so let's refresh this folder, and yes, you see&nbsp; images.zip file arrived. Just click here and&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeHfgq_lAXU&t=1629) download, and you will be able to download all of&nbsp; the images. I hope you have enjoyed. Please like,&nbsp;&nbsp;
