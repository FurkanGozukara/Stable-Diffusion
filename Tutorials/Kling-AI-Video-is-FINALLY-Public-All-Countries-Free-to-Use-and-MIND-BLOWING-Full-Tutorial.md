Kuaishou Launches Full Public Testing for 'Kling AI' to Global Users, Elevates Model Capabilities

Kuaishou Technology (HKD Counter Stock Code: 01024 / RMB Counter Stock Code: 81024) (together with its subsidiaries and consolidated affiliated entities, hereinafter referred to as "Kuaishou" or the "Company"), a leading content community and social platform, recently announced all new upgrades to the foundation model of its "Kling AI" (ÂèØÁÅµAI) video generation model, with the beta version now available to global users via web portal (Chinese version: [https://klingai.kuaishou.com/](https://klingai.kuaishou.com/) ; English version:  [https://klingai.com/](https://klingai.com/)).

In response to increasing demand from its expansive roster of content creators, Kuaishou has not only rolled out beta testing of its Kling AI to broad audiences but also launched a subscription program for users in mainland China, bringing Kling AI users more tailored features across different subscription categories. The Company expects to launch international subscriptions soon.

Enhanced Foundation Model Improves User Experience

Since its unveiling over a month ago, Kling AI has undergone multiple upgrades. With the introduction of the subscription program, the foundation model offers even more upgraded features. The latest round of upgrades significantly improves overall video quality. Videos generated by the upgraded model show improved composition and color tone, boasting better overall aesthetics. Motion performance has also been enhanced considerably, with greater movement range and accuracy.

Earlier iterations of Kling AI delivered capabilities such as image-to-video generation and video extension. At the recent World Artificial Intelligence Conference, Kling AI was officially launched on the web along with several new features, including extending the text-to-video generation duration to 10 seconds. With the latest upgrade, users can expect an even better overall AI video-generating experience.

Launched Full Beta Testing and Limited-Time Subscription Discount

As the world's first accessible, real-image-level video generation large model for ordinary users, Kling AI has been exceedingly popular since it began accepting applications on June 6. After receiving over one million applications, more than 300,000 users were granted early access. With today's announcement, Kuaishou has fully launched the beta version to everyone, bringing the exciting Kling AI experience to more users. Users will receive 66 daily "Inspiration Credits" that can be used to redeem specific functions or value-added services on the Kling AI platform, or the equivalent of producing about six free videos.

Along with the upgrade, Kling AI has also officially launched an all-new subscription program for users in mainland China. Users can choose from three subscription tiers on Kling AI's official website: Gold, Platinum and Diamond, with monthly prices of RMB66, RMB266 and RMB666, respectively.



### Video Transcription


- [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcpqAxYV1_w&t=0) Prepare to be amazed. Every video you have just&nbsp; witnessed was entirely generated by artificial&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcpqAxYV1_w&t=6) intelligence. Using the cutting-edge Kling AI&nbsp; model, these stunning visuals were made from&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcpqAxYV1_w&t=13) scratch in mere minutes, all at no cost. In this&nbsp; tutorial, I will guide you through the process of&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcpqAxYV1_w&t=19) registering for Kling AI and harnessing its free&nbsp; capabilities to produce your own mind-blowing&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcpqAxYV1_w&t=26) videos. So let's begin. Go to the Klingai.com.&nbsp; Be careful with the URL. There are several fake&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcpqAxYV1_w&t=33) sites. The link will be in the description of&nbsp; the video. Click "sign in for free credits" and&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcpqAxYV1_w&t=37) at this page, click "sign up for free." Then it&nbsp; asks you to enter your email and password. Just&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcpqAxYV1_w&t=44) set up, then as usual verify it and click sign in.&nbsp; Then let's sign in. It may ask you to complete the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcpqAxYV1_w&t=51) security verification. It is like this. Let me&nbsp; show you. It may be different on your screen.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcpqAxYV1_w&t=55) So pay attention to that. And we are signed in&nbsp; into app. So you can look at the existing videos&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcpqAxYV1_w&t=62) to get the prompting ideas from them. However, I&nbsp; will use an LLM to generate a prompt for us. So&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcpqAxYV1_w&t=70) how do we generate? You see, there are AI images&nbsp; and AI videos. I am more focused on AI videos.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcpqAxYV1_w&t=77) Let's click the AI videos in the left panel. So it&nbsp; asks us to enter our prompt. I will use Poe to&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcpqAxYV1_w&t=85) generate a prompt and I am going to use Claude&nbsp; 3.5, which is the most advanced version. This&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcpqAxYV1_w&t=93) is free to use on Poe. You can use it. You see&nbsp; this is official and doesn't require subscription.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcpqAxYV1_w&t=99) Generate me a prompt that will describe an epic&nbsp; battle scene of dragons. Okay. Let's try an

- [00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcpqAxYV1_w&t=109) hard prompt. Okay. Let's use this prompt and&nbsp; see what we are going to get. So it allows you&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcpqAxYV1_w&t=115) to describe with 2,500 characters, which is a very&nbsp; long prompt. There is creativity and relevance,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcpqAxYV1_w&t=122) high performance, high quality. High quality is&nbsp; not available yet. Paid options are not available&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcpqAxYV1_w&t=128) yet. It is only free to use right now. However,&nbsp; you are limited to generate several generations&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcpqAxYV1_w&t=134) every day. Okay. There is frame ratios. You see,&nbsp; when I hover my mouse, it shows me the resolution.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcpqAxYV1_w&t=140) So this is HD resolution. This is also HD and&nbsp; this is 960 to 960 as a square. So I'm going&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcpqAxYV1_w&t=148) to use HD resolution, 1280 to 720. There are also&nbsp; camera movement options. You can select them. You&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcpqAxYV1_w&t=155) see horizontal, vertical, zoom, pan, tilt, roll.&nbsp; So when we hover our mouse to the information, it&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcpqAxYV1_w&t=162) says when camera control method is not specified,&nbsp; the model will intelligently match based on images&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcpqAxYV1_w&t=168) or descriptions. We can also set a negative&nbsp; prompt to make it better. Let's also ask this to Claude.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcpqAxYV1_w&t=176) So my second following question is I am going to&nbsp; use this description on a text-to-video platform,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcpqAxYV1_w&t=182) optimize it, and also write me a negative prompt.&nbsp; Let's see what it is going to give us. Okay. You&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcpqAxYV1_w&t=188) see it optimized it as like we are prompting&nbsp; like Stable Diffusion models. I don't know&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcpqAxYV1_w&t=195) which one would work better. So I will test both&nbsp; of them. So this is the negative prompt. Okay.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcpqAxYV1_w&t=200) Let's also use the negative prompt. You see, it&nbsp; says that generate is 10 credits. When we go to&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcpqAxYV1_w&t=206) the billing details, it says high-performance&nbsp; video generation is 10 credits. And I have 66&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcpqAxYV1_w&t=213) credits that will expire within 24 hours. So you&nbsp; get every day, 66 credits and you can generate&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcpqAxYV1_w&t=220) 6 videos every day. Okay. Let's generate. So you&nbsp; see it is queued to generate our video. Let's also&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcpqAxYV1_w&t=228) generate with the second prompting. Okay. Maybe&nbsp; I will open another page. Okay. This is the same&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcpqAxYV1_w&t=234) video page. So I will use AI videos to generate a&nbsp; new one. Then I will use this new prompt from here&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcpqAxYV1_w&t=242) and I will use the negative prompt one more&nbsp; time. Generate. Then let's generate another&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcpqAxYV1_w&t=248) one. And this time I will not have negative&nbsp; prompt. I want to see its effect. So let's&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcpqAxYV1_w&t=253) click AI videos. You see when you open the same&nbsp; URL, it will show you the progress. Okay. This&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcpqAxYV1_w&t=259) is our original prompt and let's generate.&nbsp; You see, there is also 10 seconds. However,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcpqAxYV1_w&t=264) high-performance mode currently does not support&nbsp; 10 seconds videos. So we only get five-seconds&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcpqAxYV1_w&t=270) videos. Let's generate. And all 3 generations&nbsp; are visible here right now. Okay. Let's just&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcpqAxYV1_w&t=276) wait until they are completed. It is pretty fast when we consider that they are providing this for&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcpqAxYV1_w&t=281) free to, I don't know, maybe hundreds thousands&nbsp; of people, maybe millions of people. This model&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcpqAxYV1_w&t=288) is the state of the art right now to generate&nbsp; text-to-video. It is just mind-blowing. All 3&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcpqAxYV1_w&t=293) generations are completed. Looks like our prompt&nbsp; was very hard for the Kling AI. Perhaps it was&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcpqAxYV1_w&t=301) very long. This is the first generation. This is&nbsp; the second generation as you are seeing right now,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcpqAxYV1_w&t=306) and this was our prompt. So the prompting matters.&nbsp; Therefore you see, this is the second video. The&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcpqAxYV1_w&t=312) second video has no negative prompt. Perhaps&nbsp; the difference comes from negative prompt or&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcpqAxYV1_w&t=317) the different seed, possibly different seed. And&nbsp; this is the third video. You see, this was the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcpqAxYV1_w&t=322) third prompting way that we did. Now I will make&nbsp; easier test with image-to-video option. These were&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcpqAxYV1_w&t=329) text-to-video. It also supports initial image&nbsp; and animation to do that. I will use this example&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcpqAxYV1_w&t=336) image that I have prepared. Let's say describe&nbsp; this image like a Stable Diffusion model. I will&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcpqAxYV1_w&t=345) ask to the Claude 3.5 Sonnet. This is free to use.&nbsp; Okay. I will just use the description and see what&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcpqAxYV1_w&t=354) we are going to get. All right. So let's go to the&nbsp; image-to-video. It says you're allowed to upload&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcpqAxYV1_w&t=359) 10 megabytes with minimum dimensions. So let's&nbsp; click here. Let's select the image. There is also&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcpqAxYV1_w&t=366) add end frames. It will be like beginning frame and&nbsp; ending frame like in ToonCraft model. Maybe you have&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcpqAxYV1_w&t=372) heard it. I haven't made a video for that, but&nbsp; hopefully I will make. So you see this is our&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcpqAxYV1_w&t=376) prompt. It is also optional. So I will also try&nbsp; without any prompts and there is creativity and&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcpqAxYV1_w&t=381) relevance as usual. The length, the camera&nbsp; movement, you can see the camera movement as&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcpqAxYV1_w&t=386) well. So it is disabled for the image-to-video. We&nbsp; are not able to set camera movement. There is also&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcpqAxYV1_w&t=393) negative prompt. I'm going to delete the negative&nbsp; prompt and generate. Then let's go to here and&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcpqAxYV1_w&t=398) let's generate another version of this without&nbsp; any prompts. So we can compare what happens&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcpqAxYV1_w&t=404) with and without any prompts and we can generate&nbsp; one more time. So let's go to the image-to-video&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcpqAxYV1_w&t=411) and let's select it again. So this time what I'm&nbsp; going to do is I will use prompt and I will pick&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcpqAxYV1_w&t=419) the creativity maximum and let's see what we get.&nbsp; Okay. Let's also delete the negative prompt and&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcpqAxYV1_w&t=426) generate. So all 3 videos are getting generated&nbsp; right now. All right. All 3 videos are generated.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcpqAxYV1_w&t=433) Let's see the results. So this is the first&nbsp; generation result with the creativity maximum&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcpqAxYV1_w&t=439) you see. It is not very consistent I can say that.&nbsp; This is the second video. You see with the second&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcpqAxYV1_w&t=444) video, we didn't provide any description and we&nbsp; made it creativity and relevance medium. And this&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcpqAxYV1_w&t=452) is much more stable as you are seeing right now,&nbsp; much more consistent. So it's animated image based&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcpqAxYV1_w&t=459) on the image itself without any prompt. And this&nbsp; is the third generation. For this one we have used&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcpqAxYV1_w&t=466) our previous prompt. Yes, this was inaccurate.&nbsp; So we used our inaccurate prompt for this one.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcpqAxYV1_w&t=474) So I am trying again with the new prompt that we&nbsp; have to fix the issue. However, this prompt is&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcpqAxYV1_w&t=481) not accepted you see. Probably it has grotesque work in it. So this model may block some of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcpqAxYV1_w&t=488) prompts you have. Let's try again. Okay. It still&nbsp; doesn't accept it. Let's see what other prompt may&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcpqAxYV1_w&t=494) be preventing it. So let's see. Okay. And let's&nbsp; see what other things could be preventing it.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcpqAxYV1_w&t=503) Okay. Let's try like this. Yes, this is accepted.&nbsp; This is a basic prompt. I am also going to test&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcpqAxYV1_w&t=509) relevance maximum and I am going to test&nbsp; relevance maximum without any prompts. So&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcpqAxYV1_w&t=515) let's see all three generations results as well.&nbsp; All right. The new videos are also generated. So&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcpqAxYV1_w&t=520) these last hundred percent relevance test, you see&nbsp; it is very loyal to the original image, but the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcpqAxYV1_w&t=527) movements reduced and it is not that very great.&nbsp; And this is another test with relevance hundred&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcpqAxYV1_w&t=533) percent. And we have a basic prompt. This looks&nbsp; like the best case so far. You see it has animated&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcpqAxYV1_w&t=539) the monster pretty accurately with pretty good&nbsp; stability. Let's download this and see with the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcpqAxYV1_w&t=548) media players. So the download is getting ready&nbsp; right now. And let's look another result while&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcpqAxYV1_w&t=555) it's downloading. So in this case, we use the&nbsp; simple prompt and medium creativity and relevance.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcpqAxYV1_w&t=562) And this is also very good. So this model looks&nbsp; like working better with simple prompts rather&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcpqAxYV1_w&t=568) than very complex prompts right now, as you are&nbsp; seeing right now. Even though they have let you&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcpqAxYV1_w&t=574) 2,500 characters length, when you write a very big&nbsp; prompt, it doesn't work very well. And here the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcpqAxYV1_w&t=581) video, let's see properties. Yes, it is looking&nbsp; pretty good. There is also another feature,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcpqAxYV1_w&t=587) which is AI images. And for AI images, I am going&nbsp; to try the prompt. So let's try this prompt. We&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcpqAxYV1_w&t=594) can also upload reference image. There are also&nbsp; resolutions. You see all kinds of resolutions.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcpqAxYV1_w&t=599) Let's try this. Number of images 4. So each image&nbsp; requires 0.2 credits and we have 36 credits right&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcpqAxYV1_w&t=609) now. So let's generate 9 images. It will use 1.8&nbsp; credits. Also, I will use the other prompt that we&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcpqAxYV1_w&t=618) had, which was here. Okay. Let's go here and let's&nbsp; try this one and let's see what we will get. I&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcpqAxYV1_w&t=625) wonder that. So this will be that. Okay. Since&nbsp; this is the new one, we need to click this. Oh,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcpqAxYV1_w&t=631) we have already. Okay. We can return back. So&nbsp; this will be the prompt. Let's use this resolution&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcpqAxYV1_w&t=638) again and generate 9 more images. I wonder what we&nbsp; will get. Okay. These are the generations we get&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcpqAxYV1_w&t=646) A massive, amphibious creature emerges from a rocky shoreline. And I can say that it is not&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcpqAxYV1_w&t=652) very great. Yeah. So the AI image generation of&nbsp; this model is not that very great compared to the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcpqAxYV1_w&t=659) fine-tuned SDXL models that we have. And it&nbsp; doesn't look very good as well. So these are&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcpqAxYV1_w&t=666) the images that we have. It is decent. It is&nbsp; not bad, but it is not like superb level like&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcpqAxYV1_w&t=673) they have for text-to-video or image-to-video. And&nbsp; these are the other images that it has generated.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcpqAxYV1_w&t=679) So we can see them like this. Not very good.&nbsp; Yeah. So their image model is not very great,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcpqAxYV1_w&t=686) but their image-to-video and text-to-video&nbsp; model is just mind-blowing. I hope you have&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcpqAxYV1_w&t=691) enjoyed please leave a comment, like subscribe,&nbsp; share. Hopefully see you in another video.
