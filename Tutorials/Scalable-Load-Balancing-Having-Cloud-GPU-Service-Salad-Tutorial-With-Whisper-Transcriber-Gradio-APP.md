In this tutorial I am introducing a new cloud GPU provider Salad. They have a very unique system that allows you to both make money by renting your GPU and use their GPU orchestrator system to deploy your own docker image or their pre-configured docker images to do AI tasks such as Stable Diffusion image generation, using LLMs or transcribing audio with Whisper. Since they utilize such orchestrator GPU management system, they are able to provide fully scalable, loading balancing have and with almost 100% uptime cloud GPU inference service.

- [00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJV_9pqSgng&t=5) captions for your videos and audios, this is&nbsp; the tutorial that you need. With one click&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJV_9pqSgng&t=10) and with very cheap prices, you will be able to&nbsp; transcribe any video and audio yourself on your&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJV_9pqSgng&t=17) computer. Greetings everyone. Today I am going to&nbsp; introduce you to a new cloud GPU provider that you&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJV_9pqSgng&t=23) can use for both making money with your GPU and&nbsp; also use your AI applications on their servers&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJV_9pqSgng&t=32) with very easy scalability. Their system is very&nbsp;very unique in this area. They are using the people&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJV_9pqSgng&t=40) who rent their GPUs to the system so that they&nbsp; are able to provide very cheap prices. Moreover,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJV_9pqSgng&t=48) they are able to provide you scalability and&nbsp; dynamically load balancing very well. They&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJV_9pqSgng&t=53) have an orchestrating services system and this&nbsp; way they are able to reduce the pricing and also&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJV_9pqSgng&t=60) provide you almost 100 percent uptime with very&nbsp; minimal prices. This cloud provider has the best&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJV_9pqSgng&t=68) documentation that I have ever seen so you can&nbsp; read their documentation and their page to learn&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJV_9pqSgng&t=74) more about them. One of their unique features is&nbsp; that you can rent your GPU to their orchestrating&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJV_9pqSgng&t=80) system so your GPU will be included in their cloud&nbsp; system and based on the usage of your GPU you will&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJV_9pqSgng&t=88) make money. You can learn everything about this&nbsp; system on this page. They have an application that&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJV_9pqSgng&t=94) you download and run on your computer. In this&nbsp; way, whenever a system is used on your computer&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJV_9pqSgng&t=101) you earn money. They have a very unique and secure&nbsp; system to achieve this. Only Docker images will&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJV_9pqSgng&t=107) run in your system completely isolated therefore&nbsp; with 100 percent security. And this is the page&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJV_9pqSgng&t=114) to earn so you can read this page to learn how&nbsp; to earn money with your GPUs. However, what I&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJV_9pqSgng&t=121) am going to focus on today is how to use their&nbsp; cloud system, rent their cloud GPUs, and complete&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJV_9pqSgng&t=128) your AI tasks. So this is the readme file that&nbsp; I have prepared. The link to this file will be&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJV_9pqSgng&t=134) in the description of the video. First of all, we&nbsp; go to the portal.salad.com and you need to create&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJV_9pqSgng&t=141) an account. I am going to use my existing account.&nbsp; Then you need to create a new organization and you&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJV_9pqSgng&t=147) need to add payments to that. For example, test&nbsp; video organization. I think they don't allow this.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJV_9pqSgng&t=156) Let's try it like this and project slot name&nbsp; and create. Then you need to add money to your&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJV_9pqSgng&t=163) organization from billing. You can be in multiple&nbsp; organizations. You need to add credits to start&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJV_9pqSgng&t=168) using. Their organization system is a little bit&nbsp; different. You can read their documentation and&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJV_9pqSgng&t=174) contact support regarding the organization system.&nbsp; Once you have your organizations and you have&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJV_9pqSgng&t=180) added your credits, then this is how you use Salad&nbsp; to deploy containers. So Salad works with Docker&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJV_9pqSgng&t=188) containers. You can deploy your own container or&nbsp; their pre-configured containers. I am going to use&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJV_9pqSgng&t=194) recipe deployments to use their pre-configured&nbsp; container. So we go to the recipe deployments&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJV_9pqSgng&t=201) here. Deploy a new recipe and on this page, you&nbsp; will see a lot of models are ready to use. Like&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJV_9pqSgng&t=206) Distil Whisper large version 2, Meta LLama 7b,&nbsp; Stanford Alpaca 7b, Stable Diffusion 1.5 base,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJV_9pqSgng&t=214) Stable Diffusion andite anything version 4. You&nbsp; can contact their support to add more recipes&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJV_9pqSgng&t=220) here or you can prepare your own Docker image&nbsp; and you can deploy that as well. So today I&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJV_9pqSgng&t=226) am going to show you Whisper. I am going to make&nbsp; 2 different containers. So, I am going to first&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJV_9pqSgng&t=233) start with Distil Whisper configure and deploy.&nbsp; I am going to give a unique name, Whisper Distil&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJV_9pqSgng&t=239) SECourses and replica account. This is super&nbsp; important. What does this replica account do? It&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJV_9pqSgng&t=245) does automated load balancing with the configured&nbsp; machine and, let's say one of the computers is&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJV_9pqSgng&t=252) down in your server, it automatically starts&nbsp; another one. With this way, you can ensure that&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJV_9pqSgng&t=257) 100 percent uptime and you can have scalability&nbsp; and load balancing. It is very very useful. Let's&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJV_9pqSgng&t=264) start with 6 machines like this and it will&nbsp; show our per hour price. This is really really&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJV_9pqSgng&t=271) good price for 6 machines. These are different&nbsp; 6 machines. So, let's say you have concurrent&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJV_9pqSgng&t=278) 6 requests. Each one will be processed on the&nbsp; different machine. So, let's click deploy. By the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJV_9pqSgng&t=284) way, yeah, it doesn't allow this so let's make the&nbsp; name it like this. Yes, deploy and then on this&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJV_9pqSgng&t=290) page we will see the instances that are assigned&nbsp; to us and their status. Just wait patiently. You&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJV_9pqSgng&t=297) see it says 0/6 replicates running. Let's just&nbsp; wait a little bit. It says currently deploying.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJV_9pqSgng&t=304) Let's refresh this page. Okay, we can see that&nbsp; we got allocated with 4 instances already&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJV_9pqSgng&t=311) and our docker image is getting downloaded on&nbsp; those instances. This is also how it works when&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJV_9pqSgng&t=317) you rent your GPU to their cloud service to earn&nbsp; money. Let's also deploy another one. In this one,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJV_9pqSgng&t=324) I am going to deploy this. To deploy a machine&nbsp; you need to switch your organization first&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJV_9pqSgng&t=329) then go to the recipe deployments and in the view&nbsp; recipe marketplace. I'm going to deploy another&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJV_9pqSgng&t=335) Whisper for transcription. This time, I'm going&nbsp; to use Open AI Whisper large version 3. This is&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJV_9pqSgng&t=340) the very best Whisper version. Configure and&nbsp; deploy. Let's say Whisper large SECourses&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJV_9pqSgng&t=348) and let's make replica count 6 for this as&nbsp; well. You see this is the same price and deploy&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJV_9pqSgng&t=354) and then just wait for this one to get deployed&nbsp; as well. They have also explanations for their&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJV_9pqSgng&t=360) recipes. Let me show you what I mean. For example,&nbsp; when you click this Whisper large version 2,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJV_9pqSgng&t=365) you will get to this page and this page you will&nbsp; see this link more information available at here.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJV_9pqSgng&t=372) When you open this page, it will show you how this&nbsp; docker image was composed and how you can use it.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJV_9pqSgng&t=378) There are examples like API get, response, like&nbsp; this the python the way to use. This is totally&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJV_9pqSgng&t=386) depends on how the docker image is pre-configured&nbsp; so you can read their description to use them.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJV_9pqSgng&t=394) For this tutorial, I have prepared an amazing&nbsp; Gradio application. It is here, you see Whisper&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJV_9pqSgng&t=400) transcribe Salad.py file. When you go to this link&nbsp; you will be able to download it. This is for free&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJV_9pqSgng&t=406) for everyone let's click raw then right click and&nbsp; save as. Let's save into Salad video tutorial, Salad&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJV_9pqSgng&t=413) video tutorial. Okay, I am going to save here, you&nbsp; see I am saving at .py file like this. Okay,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJV_9pqSgng&t=420) it's saved. Let's open this folder. I also written some instructions. It is so easy, you just need to&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJV_9pqSgng&t=426) make a virtual environment, let's also edit this&nbsp; so you can do one click. Okay, here I made it one&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJV_9pqSgng&t=432) click. Let's copy this and wherever you want to&nbsp; install let's open a CMD and copy paste it right&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJV_9pqSgng&t=439) click and copy paste it and it will make the&nbsp; virtual environment move into it, activate the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJV_9pqSgng&t=444) virtual environment, you see it is activated,&nbsp; then it will install the necessary libraries&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJV_9pqSgng&t=449) for this Whisper transcribe. Salad.py file to&nbsp; work. Let's also open it with the Visual Studio&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJV_9pqSgng&t=456) Code editor like this. This is a very simple&nbsp; application but it works great. Okay, let me zoom&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJV_9pqSgng&t=461) in some. So we need to change our API URL and we&nbsp; need to change our API key, that's it and you can&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJV_9pqSgng&t=468) read the context of this py file to understand&nbsp; how the docker images of Salad works. It is so&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJV_9pqSgng&t=475) easy. Let's go to recipe deployments and we can see&nbsp; our deployings. So when we click each one of them&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJV_9pqSgng&t=481) we can see okay the first machine the Whisper&nbsp; Distil SECourses already started and running.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJV_9pqSgng&t=487) The other machines are also getting downloaded&nbsp; right now so we can already use this. Let's copy&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJV_9pqSgng&t=492) this then let's go here and change this URL to&nbsp; this link then you need to go to your API access&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJV_9pqSgng&t=499) and then you need to copy it then I will paste it&nbsp; here. You can also save this in the environment I&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJV_9pqSgng&t=505) am just making an easy demo and save it. Then what&nbsp; we need to do is we need to activate the virtual&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJV_9pqSgng&t=512) environment like this. Activate. Then move back&nbsp; to the main folder and just type python Whisper&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJV_9pqSgng&t=519) transcribe Salad.py file. It will start it in&nbsp; this URL let's go to that URL like this and our&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJV_9pqSgng&t=528) transcriber is ready to transcribe. So currently&nbsp; this application supports both a sound or video&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJV_9pqSgng&t=535) file. Click here to upload a video like this and&nbsp; it will get processed and we got the results. I&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJV_9pqSgng&t=542) have done some coding as well so you see the SRT&nbsp; output, you will see raw text output, and you will&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJV_9pqSgng&t=548) see JSON output, and all of these files will be&nbsp; automatically saved wherever the folder you have.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJV_9pqSgng&t=555) You see, you see transcription JSON file, let's&nbsp; open it with code, so this is the JSON file we got&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJV_9pqSgng&t=561) from the Docker image that is running. This is the&nbsp; SRT version of it so you can directly use it with&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJV_9pqSgng&t=567) any editor, video and this is the transcription TXT&nbsp; file. Let's try a bigger video. So this video is&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJV_9pqSgng&t=577) 26 minutes, let's see it. Let's also go back to&nbsp; our Whispers version, switch this organization,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJV_9pqSgng&t=584) recipe deployments. Okay, Whisper distil is&nbsp; running with 4 machines already. I'm also&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJV_9pqSgng&t=591) going to do the same with the large version. The&nbsp; large version download is getting more as you are&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJV_9pqSgng&t=597) seeing, so we still need to wait. Okay, the Gradio&nbsp; already started processing it. First, it extracts&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJV_9pqSgng&t=605) the MP3 file, let's see its extraction, then it&nbsp; sends it to the remote server, then we get the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJV_9pqSgng&t=613) transcription. Let's see how much time it will&nbsp; take for this 26 minutes file and it is done. It&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJV_9pqSgng&t=621) took lesser than 1 minute. Yes, it took lesser&nbsp; than 1 minute to transcribe this 26 minutes&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJV_9pqSgng&t=629) audio file. It's amazing. Just under 1 minute,&nbsp; so you can use this for your personal projects as&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJV_9pqSgng&t=635) well or you can use this for your company projects&nbsp; as well. It's up to you. This is the JSON output&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJV_9pqSgng&t=642) we got and this is the SRT file we got. So this&nbsp; is amazing. You can use this on your computer, you&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJV_9pqSgng&t=649) can use this wherever you want, for whatever the&nbsp; reason you want. It is just amazing. Since this&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJV_9pqSgng&t=656) is working with API, you can completely automate&nbsp; this process and even if you are not a programmer,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJV_9pqSgng&t=663) just following this tutorial you can use this to&nbsp; transcribe your audio, video files, personal files&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJV_9pqSgng&t=669) for whatever reason you want. I want to compare&nbsp; the speed with the large version as well. Okay,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJV_9pqSgng&t=675) the large version also started with the first&nbsp; instance, so I am going to make a copy of this&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJV_9pqSgng&t=681) file like this, let's say version 2, or let's&nbsp; say this is large. Okay then, let's edit it.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJV_9pqSgng&t=688) All I need to do is I need to change the URL to&nbsp; this, like this, and just change it. By the way,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJV_9pqSgng&t=695) I should put this into another folder so that the&nbsp; files will not conflict. Let's say large. Okay,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJV_9pqSgng&t=702) okay, let's move this to the large. So what I'm&nbsp; going to do is I will start a CMD here. First,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJV_9pqSgng&t=707) I need to activate the virtual environment. CD&nbsp; virtual environment, CD scripts, activate, then&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJV_9pqSgng&t=712) the virtual environment activated, then CD large,&nbsp; and Python Whisper transcribe salad large.py file and&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJV_9pqSgng&t=721) it is started. This time it started with Gradio share, you can also remove that. Okay, and here,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJV_9pqSgng&t=728) let's see how much time will the 15 seconds take.&nbsp; Yes, it was really, really fast. It worked very&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJV_9pqSgng&t=734) well. So that's it. You can use this Whisper to&nbsp; transcribe your videos. You can use other recipes&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJV_9pqSgng&t=740) to use for your projects. You can see them here.&nbsp; You can contact their support to add more recipes,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJV_9pqSgng&t=746) or you can build your own Docker image and you&nbsp; can deploy it. So all you need to do is give your&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJV_9pqSgng&t=753) Docker image here, give a container name. You can&nbsp; also decide which CPUs you want to use. You can&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJV_9pqSgng&t=759) decide how much RAM you need. You can decide which&nbsp; GPUs to rent based on your Docker image needings. You see,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJV_9pqSgng&t=767) 3090 is only 25 cents per hour or 2060 is only&nbsp; 5 cents per hour. So they have a lot of GPUs&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJV_9pqSgng&t=776) in the pool. They are trying to expand it as&nbsp; well, and you can allocate the hard disk that&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJV_9pqSgng&t=782) you need. A lot of options here, you can set all&nbsp; of them. This is for more professionals. So that's&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJV_9pqSgng&t=788) it. I hope you have enjoyed. Hopefully,&nbsp; see you in another amazing tutorial.
