### Video Transcription


- [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VR1s7LxK5ZU&t=0) Greetings everyone. In today's video, I am going&nbsp; to show you how to use SwarmUI on a free Kaggle

- [00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VR1s7LxK5ZU&t=7) account, so that you don't need to pay to any&nbsp; online services. This is especially useful if

- [00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VR1s7LxK5ZU&t=14) you don't have a powerful GPU. The link of this&nbsp; post will be in the description of the video. Just

- [00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VR1s7LxK5ZU&t=20) download the latest installer, you can download it&nbsp; from here. Then go to Kaggle, register an account

- [00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VR1s7LxK5ZU&t=26) and verify your phone number. This is mandatory.&nbsp; After you have verified your phone number, click

- [00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VR1s7LxK5ZU&t=32) create, new notebook. Wait for editor to be loaded&nbsp; like this. Once you get this screen, click file,

- [00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VR1s7LxK5ZU&t=41) import notebook. Then you can drag and drop the&nbsp; downloaded file to here, or you can click browse

- [00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VR1s7LxK5ZU&t=47) files and select the downloaded notebook like&nbsp; this. Then click import. Once you see the file

- [00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VR1s7LxK5ZU&t=56) has been imported like this, you can click X icon&nbsp; here. You don't need to wait fully, but you can

- [00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VR1s7LxK5ZU&t=64) also wait, it's an option. After that, verify that&nbsp; accelerator is selected as GPU T4 x2 and internet

- [00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VR1s7LxK5ZU&t=75) is on. This is mandatory, otherwise it will not&nbsp; work. Then we will start our session. This is

- [00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VR1s7LxK5ZU&t=81) the first cell that we need to install, so let's&nbsp; start our session from here. Wait for session to

- [00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VR1s7LxK5ZU&t=89) be started. Once you see a green circle here, you&nbsp; see, it says running. Click here and verify that

- [00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VR1s7LxK5ZU&t=97) you have the GPU and everything is working as&nbsp; expected like this. Then click this cell. When

- [00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VR1s7LxK5ZU&t=106) you click this cell, you can either click here&nbsp; to play it, or you can click here to play it. You

- [00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VR1s7LxK5ZU&t=111) see run current cell. But make sure that you have&nbsp; selected the accurate cell. Then let's click this,

- [00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VR1s7LxK5ZU&t=118) and it will start installation of the necessary&nbsp; libraries to run the SwarmUI on a free Kaggle

- [00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VR1s7LxK5ZU&t=124) account. With this SwarmUI, you can use FLUX Dev&nbsp; model, SDXL model, Stable Diffusion 1.5 model,

- [00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VR1s7LxK5ZU&t=132) Stable Diffusion 3.5 model, Hunyuan video model,&nbsp; Mochi video model, whatever SwarmUI supports, you

- [00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VR1s7LxK5ZU&t=142) can use it here, as long as it doesn't exceed the&nbsp; requirements. Because we have only 29 gigabytes

- [00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VR1s7LxK5ZU&t=152) of RAM and we have GPUs that are 15 gigabytes.&nbsp; However, since we have two GPUs here, we can

- [00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VR1s7LxK5ZU&t=160) generate two images or two videos at the same&nbsp; time, as long as they are fitting into GPU and

- [00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VR1s7LxK5ZU&t=167) they are not causing out of RAM error. So you see,&nbsp; this cell execution has been completed because

- [00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VR1s7LxK5ZU&t=176) there is not anymore running icon here. You can&nbsp; also see the status from here as well. There is

- [00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VR1s7LxK5ZU&t=182) no running icon anymore. Then scroll down. You can&nbsp; see the installation logs like this when you are

- [00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VR1s7LxK5ZU&t=189) scrolling down. Or you can right click and you&nbsp; can say clear outputs of all cells, so that it

- [00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VR1s7LxK5ZU&t=198) will clear all the installation logs. After that,&nbsp; go to the Step 1 cell. So we have a lot of cells

- [00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VR1s7LxK5ZU&t=207) to automatically download the models. The favorite&nbsp; models that you might enjoy. Like this cell will

- [00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VR1s7LxK5ZU&t=215) download SDXL models or Stable Diffusion&nbsp; 1.5 models. We have set some models for you

- [00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VR1s7LxK5ZU&t=221) to automatically download. If you don't want to&nbsp; download a certain model, you can put a hashtag in

- [00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VR1s7LxK5ZU&t=227) front of that model and it will disable download&nbsp; of that model. Since we have limited space on

- [00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VR1s7LxK5ZU&t=236) Kaggle, you see we have 57 gigabytes of disk space&nbsp; total, we cannot download every model. You need to

- [00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VR1s7LxK5ZU&t=243) pay attention to the models that you need, that&nbsp; you are going to use after the installation. So

- [00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VR1s7LxK5ZU&t=248) download the models accordingly. For example, this&nbsp; cell will download the very best deterministic

- [00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VR1s7LxK5ZU&t=255) upscale models. This cell will download a better&nbsp; clip model for the FLUX. This cell will download

- [00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VR1s7LxK5ZU&t=261) FLUX Dev model, Stable Diffusion 3.5 large model.&nbsp; This cell will download the FLUX Redux model. So

- [00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VR1s7LxK5ZU&t=270) read every one of the cells and decide which ones&nbsp; you want to download according to your needs. For

- [00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VR1s7LxK5ZU&t=278) example, this cell will download the Hunyuan text&nbsp; to video model. This is higher quality model, 20

- [00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VR1s7LxK5ZU&t=286) steps. It is going to download Q6 GGUF model. This&nbsp; cell will download faster Hunyuan video model. This

- [00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VR1s7LxK5ZU&t=297) is 6 steps model. So read all of the cells and&nbsp; download whichever model you need. I am going to

- [00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VR1s7LxK5ZU&t=305) download this fast model to generate some example&nbsp; videos. We already have amazing SwarmUI tutorials

- [00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VR1s7LxK5ZU&t=313) playlist, so you can look at our playlist and&nbsp; watch all of our SwarmUI tutorials to learn more

- [00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VR1s7LxK5ZU&t=322) about SwarmUI. Hopefully, I will put the link into&nbsp; the description of the video, so you can quickly

- [00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VR1s7LxK5ZU&t=328) navigate to there to learn how to use SwarmUI with&nbsp; different models and its different features. Once

- [00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VR1s7LxK5ZU&t=335) you have installed, everything is exactly same to&nbsp; use on Kaggle. So the download was extremely fast.

- [00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VR1s7LxK5ZU&t=342) You see 678 megabytes per second. This is also an&nbsp; optimization that I do. So it took 27 seconds to

- [00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VR1s7LxK5ZU&t=352) download. So after you have checked everything and&nbsp; you are ready to use SwarmUI, you downloaded all

- [00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VR1s7LxK5ZU&t=359) the models. We are going to use this to be able&nbsp; to connect the SwarmUI interface. So click this

- [00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VR1s7LxK5ZU&t=366) link. Register a free account. You can register&nbsp; any account. Then click to copy your token like

- [00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VR1s7LxK5ZU&t=376) this. Then you will see put your token here, put&nbsp; your token there. Then when this cell is selected,

- [00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VR1s7LxK5ZU&t=384) click play icon once. You can run from here or&nbsp; from here. Let's run from here. Then you will get

- [00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VR1s7LxK5ZU&t=391) a link like this. Open this link by clicking&nbsp; that and you will get to this page. However,

- [00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VR1s7LxK5ZU&t=397) do not click visit site yet. We only click visit&nbsp; site when the application is running at localhost.

- [00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VR1s7LxK5ZU&t=406) I will show you what I mean. Get to Step 3 cell. This cell will install the SwarmUI and

- [00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VR1s7LxK5ZU&t=413) start it. So click to run that cell and just&nbsp; wait until you see this. Let me show you what you

- [00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VR1s7LxK5ZU&t=422) are going to see. You are going to see starting&nbsp; web server on [http://0.0.0.0:7801.](http://0.0.0.0:7801.) This means that the

- [00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VR1s7LxK5ZU&t=433) application started locally on the Kaggle server.&nbsp; However, to be able to access it, we need a public

- [00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VR1s7LxK5ZU&t=440) endpoint, which is this link. Now click visit site&nbsp; and the SwarmUI interface will load. On Kaggle,

- [00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VR1s7LxK5ZU&t=449) we are using pre-installed ComfyUI backend,&nbsp; which we have installed at the very first cell

- [00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VR1s7LxK5ZU&t=457) that we have run. So click agree. Click customize&nbsp; settings. This is super important. Click next.

- [00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VR1s7LxK5ZU&t=464) Select the theme you want. Next. Just yourself on&nbsp; this PC. Next. And this is crucial, none. Select

- [00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VR1s7LxK5ZU&t=472) none because we are going to use pre-installed&nbsp; ComfyUI backend. So this is important. Select

- [00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VR1s7LxK5ZU&t=479) none and click next. Do not download any model&nbsp; because we have downloaded everything we needed

- [00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VR1s7LxK5ZU&t=485) into the temp disk because it is the bigger disk.&nbsp; Then click next. Then yes, I am sure install now.

- [00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VR1s7LxK5ZU&t=493) It will be almost instant like this because we&nbsp; didn't install any backend and it is done. Now,

- [00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VR1s7LxK5ZU&t=500) we are going to add backends. So click server,&nbsp; click backends and click ComfyUI self starting.

- [00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VR1s7LxK5ZU&t=509) Click okay. Then click ComfyUI self starting&nbsp; again and click okay. Then go back to the Kaggle

- [00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VR1s7LxK5ZU&t=516) notebook editor and go back to the top of the&nbsp; Step 3 cell. You will see that there is this

- [00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VR1s7LxK5ZU&t=524) text after SwarmUI started first add. So select&nbsp; this part and copy it. Go back to the SwarmUI

- [00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VR1s7LxK5ZU&t=531) interface. Paste it here. Then make the GPU ID&nbsp; of the second one as GPU ID 1. Then click save

- [00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VR1s7LxK5ZU&t=541) and click save. Now it will start the backends,&nbsp; install the missing libraries or anything. You can

- [00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VR1s7LxK5ZU&t=549) go to logs, click debug and watch the progress.&nbsp; There is one another thing that we have to make

- [00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VR1s7LxK5ZU&t=556) which is server configuration. Click server&nbsp; configuration, return back to Kaggle and you see

- [00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VR1s7LxK5ZU&t=562) there is this folder, Kaggle temp. Copy it. Return&nbsp; back to SwarmUI interface. Paste it here. You

- [00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VR1s7LxK5ZU&t=569) see model root. Once you paste it and click it&nbsp; another cell, you will see that there is save.

- [00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VR1s7LxK5ZU&t=575) So click save. So now it will change the model&nbsp; root and it will load the backends. We don't need

- [00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VR1s7LxK5ZU&t=582) to restart SwarmUI multiple times anymore because&nbsp; this will work perfectly now. Just go to logs and

- [00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VR1s7LxK5ZU&t=588) watch in the debug and you see loading backends&nbsp; disappeared. So the SwarmUI is ready to use. So

- [00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VR1s7LxK5ZU&t=596) click models and click refresh. Currently we only&nbsp; downloaded fast Hunyuan video because everything is

- [00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VR1s7LxK5ZU&t=602) same as in other tutorials, just watch them.&nbsp; But I will make an example of Hunyuan video. So

- [00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VR1s7LxK5ZU&t=608) click this. And once you clicked it, you see it is&nbsp; selected. This is a fast model so it is 6 steps.

- [00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VR1s7LxK5ZU&t=616) But before doing that, we need to install a node,&nbsp; if I remember correctly. So click this hamburger

- [00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VR1s7LxK5ZU&t=623) menu and click load now. And you see it is asking&nbsp; me to install GGUF support. So install and okay.

- [00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VR1s7LxK5ZU&t=633) Just wait for installation to be completed. You&nbsp; see it says backends are still loading because

- [00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VR1s7LxK5ZU&t=638) it installed the necessary library and it is&nbsp; reloading the backend and now it is done. Then we

- [00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VR1s7LxK5ZU&t=645) can continue setting up the necessary parameters.&nbsp; This is CFG 1 and click display advanced options. I

- [00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VR1s7LxK5ZU&t=652) am going to make another tutorial for Hunyuan video,&nbsp; but I am showing here quickly so that you will see

- [00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VR1s7LxK5ZU&t=658) there is text to video now. You can set number of&nbsp; frames, FPS, another thing. Let's just generate

- [00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VR1s7LxK5ZU&t=664) 25 frames, so it will be one second video. And&nbsp; it is 6 steps, CFG scale 1. In the sampling,

- [00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VR1s7LxK5ZU&t=673) we are going to make the FLUX guidance scale&nbsp; 10. This is for fast Hunyuan video and we are

- [00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VR1s7LxK5ZU&t=679) also going to change something else which&nbsp; is in the advanced sampling and Sigma Shift,

- [00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VR1s7LxK5ZU&t=686) it is 17. I will use an example prompt that I&nbsp; have found on the internet. This is an example

- [00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VR1s7LxK5ZU&t=693) prompt for Hunyuan video. You can read this, just&nbsp; pause the video and read it and click generate.

- [00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VR1s7LxK5ZU&t=701) Now let's watch how much time it is going to take.&nbsp; I hope that it won't take too long because we have

- [00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VR1s7LxK5ZU&t=707) limited VRAM. So first of all, it will download&nbsp; the necessary missing models, then it will start

- [00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VR1s7LxK5ZU&t=714) generation. You can always watch the status from&nbsp; the debug menu. So it is downloading the LLAVA LLAMA3

- [00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VR1s7LxK5ZU&t=721) FP8 scaled version automatically. You can&nbsp; also monitor some of the progress on the Kaggle

- [00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VR1s7LxK5ZU&t=729) notebook as well. So let's just wait. Okay, so the&nbsp; model has been downloaded and the video generation

- [00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VR1s7LxK5ZU&t=736) started. However, there is an error, the mistake,&nbsp; which is that it is using our entire GPU memory,

- [00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VR1s7LxK5ZU&t=746) therefore it is just too slow. So what I am&nbsp; going to do is, I have replaced the download

- [00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VR1s7LxK5ZU&t=752) with Q4 instead of the Q6, so it will use lesser&nbsp; VRAM, therefore it should work faster. So how

- [00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VR1s7LxK5ZU&t=760) am I going to do that? By the way, in your case,&nbsp; when you download the notebook, you will get the

- [00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VR1s7LxK5ZU&t=766) updated Kaggle notebook, not the Q6 version.&nbsp; But you will learn how to cancel and run the

- [00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VR1s7LxK5ZU&t=773) application again when you want to download&nbsp; a new model or make changes. So cancel run,

- [00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VR1s7LxK5ZU&t=780) and the run has been cancelled. Let's redownload&nbsp; the Q4 version. So I will click this and it should

- [00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VR1s7LxK5ZU&t=786) redownload very fast. Yes, we can see the speed&nbsp; here. So it is around 700 megabytes. Let me also

- [00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VR1s7LxK5ZU&t=795) update the notebook. Okay. And you can watch&nbsp; the disk space that you are using, so you won't

- [00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VR1s7LxK5ZU&t=803) get out of disk space. Okay. Disk space may get&nbsp; updated a little bit later. Let's also download

- [00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VR1s7LxK5ZU&t=811) some of the SDXL models, so I can also show you&nbsp; how to use them. The SDXL model download was step

- [00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VR1s7LxK5ZU&t=817) 1, so I will run this cell. It will download the&nbsp; SDXL models extremely fast. Just wait until cancel

- [00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VR1s7LxK5ZU&t=826) run disappears. Okay, new downloads have been&nbsp; completed. Now we are using around 50 gigabytes

- [00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VR1s7LxK5ZU&t=834) of disk space. Now we will restart the SwarmUI.&nbsp; But we don't need to reinstall. How to restart?

- [00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VR1s7LxK5ZU&t=842) Go to Step 2 cell again, run it. Get a new link&nbsp; here, open it. But do not click visit site yet.

- [00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VR1s7LxK5ZU&t=850) Scroll down to the Step 4 and just execute it.&nbsp; And when you see that starting web server on this

- [00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VR1s7LxK5ZU&t=858) local URL, you are ready. Click this cell. Go&nbsp; to the link and visit site. Okay. It is asking

- [00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VR1s7LxK5ZU&t=866) us to reinstall, this shouldn't happen normally.&nbsp; However, on Kaggle, this can happen sometimes,

- [00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VR1s7LxK5ZU&t=872) so if you encounter that, don't get confused. So&nbsp; we are going to reinstall quickly as before. Next,

- [00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VR1s7LxK5ZU&t=882) next. Okay. So it should be instant. Yes. The&nbsp; bad side of this is that we need to re-add the

- [00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VR1s7LxK5ZU&t=891) backend. So we will do that. Unfortunately, on&nbsp; Kaggle, it is not as easy as using in our own

- [00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VR1s7LxK5ZU&t=899) PC. Scroll back top of the Step 3. Copy the&nbsp; backend link, this one, pay attention. Copy paste

- [00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VR1s7LxK5ZU&t=908) here and here. Set the GPU ID, save, save. Go back&nbsp; to server configuration. Copy the folder path like

- [00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VR1s7LxK5ZU&t=917) this. Change here and save and wait for backends&nbsp; to be loaded. You can monitor logs, debug. Okay,

- [00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VR1s7LxK5ZU&t=926) it is loaded. Go to back to the generate and click&nbsp; models, refresh. Don't forget to refresh. Now we

- [00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VR1s7LxK5ZU&t=934) have different models. Let's generate an image&nbsp; with the Realistic Vision XL version 5. This is

- [00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VR1s7LxK5ZU&t=940) an SDXL model. Let's say super fast car. Then&nbsp; I will try Hunyuan Q4 GGUF model. First, it will

- [00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VR1s7LxK5ZU&t=951) load the model, then it will start generation.&nbsp; You can watch logs in here in the server logs.

- [00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VR1s7LxK5ZU&t=959) This should be pretty fast compared to the Hunyuan&nbsp; video. You can watch the status here also. You see

- [00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VR1s7LxK5ZU&t=966) 1 current generation, 1 queued, 1 waiting&nbsp; on model load. Okay, model loaded and generation

- [00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VR1s7LxK5ZU&t=973) has been started and we should get the results&nbsp; in a few seconds. We can see the speed here.

- [00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VR1s7LxK5ZU&t=979) It is 1.23 IT per second and the image has been&nbsp; generated. Yes. You see it is working perfect.

- [00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VR1s7LxK5ZU&t=988) Now let's try again the fast Hunyuan. By the way, it&nbsp; still shows the Q6 because we had downloaded it,

- [00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VR1s7LxK5ZU&t=997) but we are going to select Q4. Okay, let's select&nbsp; it. We need to reset the parameters, CFG 1, 6

- [00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VR1s7LxK5ZU&t=1006) steps. Let's click load model. Okay. You see this&nbsp; time it didn't ask me to reinstall the necessary

- [00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VR1s7LxK5ZU&t=1014) node because it was installed. Then click display&nbsp; advanced options. We are going to select the

- [00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VR1s7LxK5ZU&t=1020) sampling and FLUX guidance scale as 10 and we&nbsp; are going to set the Advanced Sampling Sigma

- [00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VR1s7LxK5ZU&t=1027) Shift 17. And let's copy paste our prompt. Okay&nbsp; and generate a video. Let's see how it will work.

- [00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VR1s7LxK5ZU&t=1038) You can also change the video format from here to&nbsp; GIF, WebM or MP4. This will change the extension,

- [00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VR1s7LxK5ZU&t=1048) the video file format that it is going to&nbsp; generate. Let's go to server and let's see. Okay,

- [00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VR1s7LxK5ZU&t=1055) it gave some errors, but I think it is fixing&nbsp; itself. Let's see. I think it is getting loaded

- [00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VR1s7LxK5ZU&t=1062) right now. Yes, you can also see the status here.&nbsp; You see the RAM is increasing. That means that it

- [00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VR1s7LxK5ZU&t=1069) is loading the model into the RAM first, then it&nbsp; will load it into the GPU memory. Okay, this time

- [00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VR1s7LxK5ZU&t=1076) it loaded it into our second backend into the GPU&nbsp; ID 1, you can see that. It is only using 11.9

- [00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VR1s7LxK5ZU&t=1084) gigabytes of VRAM memory right now, so the speed&nbsp; should be relatively faster than the Q6 model.

- [00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VR1s7LxK5ZU&t=1093) However, still, the GPUs on the Kaggle is slow,&nbsp; therefore it will take time. And as you generate

- [00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VR1s7LxK5ZU&t=1099) a bigger frames having video, it will take even&nbsp; longer, or if you generate a bigger resolution,

- [00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VR1s7LxK5ZU&t=1106) it will take longer. This is just a demonstration&nbsp; how it works on Kaggle. How to use the SwarmUI,

- [00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VR1s7LxK5ZU&t=1114) watch the tutorials and I am hopefully going to&nbsp; make another tutorial, a more detailed tutorial

- [00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VR1s7LxK5ZU&t=1119) for Hunyuan video. Okay, so the video generation has&nbsp; been started. However, it is extremely slow due

- [00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VR1s7LxK5ZU&t=1127) to the GPU of the Kaggle. One step is taking 900&nbsp; seconds. So if you are not in hurry, you can of

- [00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VR1s7LxK5ZU&t=1136) course generate video and wait it to be completed&nbsp; because Kaggle provides 30 hours of free GPU time

- [00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VR1s7LxK5ZU&t=1145) every week. We can see that, let me show you.&nbsp; Okay, you see that I have left 28 hours of GPU

- [00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VR1s7LxK5ZU&t=1155) time for this week. This is weekly and for free.&nbsp; However, it is just extremely slow for this model,

- [00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VR1s7LxK5ZU&t=1162) but you can use it for SDXL, FLUX Dev, Stable&nbsp; Diffusion 3.5, SD 1.5, even Mochi video model.

- [00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VR1s7LxK5ZU&t=1173) So currently this is the speed, it may get faster&nbsp; when you are using this tutorial, but you know,

- [00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VR1s7LxK5ZU&t=1179) I am teaching you how to use and the rest is up&nbsp; to you to figure it out how you want to use it.

- [00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VR1s7LxK5ZU&t=1185) So how you can download the generated videos&nbsp; or images? Once you are done with everything,

- [00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VR1s7LxK5ZU&t=1193) click cancel run here. Then go to the very bottom&nbsp; cell and click this play icon. This is usually the

- [00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VR1s7LxK5ZU&t=1201) way I develop my Kaggle notebooks and you see it&nbsp; has generated a zip file. This zip file will be

- [00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VR1s7LxK5ZU&t=1208) here. Click this icon, it will list then you see&nbsp; there is generated zip. So click here and download

- [00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VR1s7LxK5ZU&t=1216) and it will download all the generations you have&nbsp; made on Kaggle as a single zip file. It will make

- [00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VR1s7LxK5ZU&t=1223) your life easier. Hopefully see you in the future&nbsp; videos. Please subscribe. I will keep updating and
