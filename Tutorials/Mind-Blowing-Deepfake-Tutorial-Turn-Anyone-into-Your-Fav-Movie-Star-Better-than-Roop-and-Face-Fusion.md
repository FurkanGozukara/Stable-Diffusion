### Video Transcription


- [00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdWKOUlenaY&t=21) It has been 11 months since we published our&nbsp; first deepfake tutorial, and today it is time&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdWKOUlenaY&t=28) to update this tutorial with the newest&nbsp; application, Rope-Pearl. Rope-Pearl has&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdWKOUlenaY&t=34) just been published today, and this application&nbsp; is many times better than our latest tutorial&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdWKOUlenaY&t=40) application. It is so much easier to use, with so&nbsp; many new features. So, let's begin the tutorial.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdWKOUlenaY&t=47) You can follow the instructions on their GitHub&nbsp; repository to install it. However, I have prepared&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdWKOUlenaY&t=54) amazing installer files for you. So, download&nbsp; the attachment from here. Go to the very bottom&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdWKOUlenaY&t=60) of the post. This post will be in the description&nbsp; of the video. So, click here to download it. Then,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdWKOUlenaY&t=65) move it into your disk wherever you want to&nbsp; install. Let's install it inside rope_ai. So,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdWKOUlenaY&t=72) this is where I am going to install. Do not&nbsp; make its name as rope, and then extract the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdWKOUlenaY&t=77) files here like this. And this is it. We also have&nbsp; an installer for Massed Compute. If you are using&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdWKOUlenaY&t=83) Linux, you can use it. So, just double-click the&nbsp; install.bat file. It will start installation. So,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdWKOUlenaY&t=90) for this installation to work, there are several&nbsp; things that you have to install yourself. Open a&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdWKOUlenaY&t=95) CMD and type "python" like this. You should get&nbsp; 3.10.11 preferably. You can also have 3.10.6,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdWKOUlenaY&t=105) but I suggest you to use 3.10.11. What else you&nbsp; need? You need to also have installed Git. So,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdWKOUlenaY&t=110) when you type "git", you should get a message like&nbsp; this. You need to have installed FFmpeg. So, when&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdWKOUlenaY&t=115) you type "ffmpeg", you should get a message like&nbsp; this. You need to also have installed CUDA. So,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdWKOUlenaY&t=121) when you type "nvcc --version", you should&nbsp; get a message like this. Unfortunately,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdWKOUlenaY&t=127) there isn't an easy way to test C++ tools. But&nbsp; installing all of these are step-by-step explained&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdWKOUlenaY&t=135) in this amazing tutorial video. So, this is the&nbsp; tutorial video that you need to follow to install&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdWKOUlenaY&t=141) all those requirements. Once you have installed&nbsp; these requirements, you will be able to use pretty&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdWKOUlenaY&t=146) much all of the AI applications on your Windows&nbsp; computer. On Massed Compute, you don't need to&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdWKOUlenaY&t=152) install any of these. We are preparing the image&nbsp; for you. If you are using an Ubuntu Linux system&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdWKOUlenaY&t=158) on your local computer, you also need to install&nbsp; these yourself. So, my automatic installer will&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdWKOUlenaY&t=163) also download all of the necessary models into the&nbsp; accurate folders. You don't need to do anything&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdWKOUlenaY&t=169) else. Once you have installed these, you will just&nbsp; run my scripts. All of my scripts. I have so many&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdWKOUlenaY&t=175) scripts to install, and they will automatically&nbsp; install everything for you. Just patiently wait.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdWKOUlenaY&t=181) Moreover, this script will generate a virtual&nbsp; environment. Therefore, this installation will not&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdWKOUlenaY&t=186) break or conflict with any other application you&nbsp; have on your computer. It will be totally isolated&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdWKOUlenaY&t=193) in the virtual environment folder. We can already&nbsp; see that. So, when I enter inside the Rope folder,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdWKOUlenaY&t=200) you will see that there is a venv folder. So, this&nbsp; is the virtual environment folder where everything&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdWKOUlenaY&t=206) is installed. The installation is also pretty&nbsp; lightweight. All of the models are around 1.6 GB.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdWKOUlenaY&t=212) There is also a virtual environment folder. So, it&nbsp; shouldn't take too much space in total. We can see&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdWKOUlenaY&t=218) that in a moment. So, it is around 6 GB. Moreover,&nbsp; I have prepared example images and a video file&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdWKOUlenaY&t=227) for you. So, you will be able to directly test&nbsp; the application on these images and on the example&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdWKOUlenaY&t=234) video file, which I am going to show. So, the&nbsp; installation has been completed. I also fixed&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdWKOUlenaY&t=240) this system cannot find the path specified error,&nbsp; so you won't get it. So, the git folder is also&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdWKOUlenaY&t=245) deleted. And now, how are we going to start the&nbsp; application after the installation is completed?&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdWKOUlenaY&t=251) Just double-click the windows_start.bat file, and&nbsp; it will start the application for you like this.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdWKOUlenaY&t=257) This application has a nice GUI to use. Okay,&nbsp; so this is the application interface. It may&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdWKOUlenaY&t=263) be a little bit overwhelming at the first look,&nbsp; but it is fine. First of all, we will begin with&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdWKOUlenaY&t=269) selecting the videos folder. Since I have prepared&nbsp; an example videos folder, I am going to select&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdWKOUlenaY&t=274) that folder like this and select folder. Once you&nbsp; have selected the folder, it will scan all of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdWKOUlenaY&t=280) videos available under that folder. Then, you&nbsp; need to select the faces folder. So, click the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdWKOUlenaY&t=285) faces folder. I'm going to select the same folder&nbsp; because I have put everything inside, and all of&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdWKOUlenaY&t=291) the images of the faces will come here. What if&nbsp; you have just started the application or you added&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdWKOUlenaY&t=297) new files to the videos folder or selected faces&nbsp; folder? How to refresh this interface? To refresh&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdWKOUlenaY&t=306) this interface, click this "Start Rope" button&nbsp; here, and it will refresh the folders, and you&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdWKOUlenaY&t=313) will get the refreshed updated images in here.&nbsp; So, after you click this "Start Rope" button,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdWKOUlenaY&t=320) it will repopulate the videos folder and also&nbsp; the images folder with the newest files. Then,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdWKOUlenaY&t=328) you need to select the output folder. This is&nbsp; important. Click that and let's make a new folder&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdWKOUlenaY&t=333) here like "outputs". You can save them anywhere,&nbsp; and then select the folder, and you will see the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdWKOUlenaY&t=339) output folder is selected. Now, how does this&nbsp; work? This application is extremely advanced.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdWKOUlenaY&t=345) First of all, select your video. Then, as a next&nbsp; step, click "Find Faces" here. It will find all&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdWKOUlenaY&t=353) the faces inside that video. Then, select the face&nbsp; that you want to replace. I am going to replace&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdWKOUlenaY&t=359) first this face. Then, select the face that you&nbsp; want to replace with him. When I click this face,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdWKOUlenaY&t=365) it is done, but I am not seeing the replacement&nbsp; applied. So to apply the swap faces, you need to&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdWKOUlenaY&t=373) click here and you will see that in a moment, the&nbsp; face changes. The speed of updates depends on your&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdWKOUlenaY&t=381) computer and you see the face changed. Let's also&nbsp; set a face for this one as well. For this face,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdWKOUlenaY&t=388) I am going to use this and you see it is also&nbsp; changed. However, the quality is not great yet.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdWKOUlenaY&t=393) So this application has a new way. When you&nbsp; select the Swapper Resolution here, it will&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdWKOUlenaY&t=398) enhance it greatly. You see from 128 to 512;&nbsp; in our previous tutorial, it was only 128-pixel&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdWKOUlenaY&t=408) resolution. However, with the Rope Pearl, we are&nbsp; able to get 512. It is not native. It is done with&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdWKOUlenaY&t=416) mathematical tricks, but it is working. Are we&nbsp; done yet? No, there are so many options. I prefer&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdWKOUlenaY&t=422) to enable the restorer. This is going to apply&nbsp; face restoration. The best face restoration is&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdWKOUlenaY&t=429) GPEN512. You see my interface frozen right now.&nbsp; This is the application's only negative side.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdWKOUlenaY&t=437) When you make changes, the application freezes&nbsp; until it is done. Then I will click this and&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdWKOUlenaY&t=443) it will apply that restoration. You need to wait&nbsp; to&nbsp;&nbsp;be apply it. Yes, you see. Then I'm going to&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdWKOUlenaY&t=449) select original. I find this best. However, it is&nbsp; very strong right now. So I am going to make the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdWKOUlenaY&t=454) blend ratio as 30% and hit enter and you will&nbsp; see that it will become much more natural and&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdWKOUlenaY&t=462) according to the flow of the video. Then I also&nbsp; make some other changes. Let me demonstrate to you&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdWKOUlenaY&t=468) what I mean. So when you look here, you will&nbsp; notice that there are some mistakes. Therefore,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdWKOUlenaY&t=475) I am enabling strength. And I am making the&nbsp; size border distance 20. One other thing is&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdWKOUlenaY&t=481) that when you hover your mouse over the settings&nbsp; configuration here, it will display to you what&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdWKOUlenaY&t=489) that configuration does in the very bottom of&nbsp; the screen. You will see the description of&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdWKOUlenaY&t=495) each option here. So as I move my mouse over each&nbsp; option, it shows me a very detailed description&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdWKOUlenaY&t=504) of what each option does. There is also a support&nbsp; link of the original author of the Rope Pearl. So&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdWKOUlenaY&t=512) if you support him, it is up to you. Moreover,&nbsp; you can test them immediately. For example,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdWKOUlenaY&t=518) let's make the strength 300 and it will apply the&nbsp; face much more strongly. You see it becomes like&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdWKOUlenaY&t=523) this. I find that 100 is working really decently.&nbsp; Then there is also Occluder that I find this is&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdWKOUlenaY&t=530) improving some of the errors. Pay attention to&nbsp; my mouse and see the error. You see it is fixing&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdWKOUlenaY&t=538) that error. Actually, I have done some tests for&nbsp; you. When you enter tests and configs, you will&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdWKOUlenaY&t=546) have videos and the configurations in here. So&nbsp; you can look at each one of them and see which&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdWKOUlenaY&t=552) differences each configuration makes to learn&nbsp; more. Then there is also a face parser. This is&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdWKOUlenaY&t=558) also super important. Why? Now let me demonstrate&nbsp; to you. You see the mouth of the replaced face is&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdWKOUlenaY&t=566) very bad. We are going to fix that as well. Click&nbsp; here and make the mouth 10%. Okay, and now pay&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdWKOUlenaY&t=573) attention to the mouth and what it becomes.&nbsp; You will see that it gets fixed. Of course,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdWKOUlenaY&t=578) this is preventing to use the target mouth of&nbsp; the image. However, this is fixing the mouth&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdWKOUlenaY&t=586) movement immediately. So this is super important&nbsp; and there are other options. You can test them.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdWKOUlenaY&t=592) I didn't find them improving the quality. Based&nbsp; on your GPU you can reduce the number of threads&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdWKOUlenaY&t=599) here to 1. So if you don't have a strong GPU, make&nbsp; the number of threads 1. Okay, we made everything&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdWKOUlenaY&t=606) and now how we are going to do deep fake and face&nbsp; swap of our original video. So first of all, bring&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdWKOUlenaY&t=615) your scroll to the wherever you want to start&nbsp; replacing. I will replace the entire video so I&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdWKOUlenaY&t=621) go to the beginning. You can also click here to go&nbsp; to the very beginning and there is one more thing:&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdWKOUlenaY&t=627) you can set the output video quality from here.&nbsp; 18 is a decent quality; this is changing the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdWKOUlenaY&t=634) video quality, nothing related to the deep fake&nbsp; or face swapping. Let's make this 12. 12 will get&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdWKOUlenaY&t=640) more size in the output video but it will have a&nbsp; better quality of the video encoding. So this is&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdWKOUlenaY&t=647) related to the video encoding quality. You can&nbsp; also see the description in the bottom. Also,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdWKOUlenaY&t=653) you will see that there is an option to support&nbsp; the original author, so it is up to you to support&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdWKOUlenaY&t=657) him. Okay, everything is set. So now, how we are&nbsp; going to export the final video? You need to first&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdWKOUlenaY&t=664) click this icon; it means that it is recording.&nbsp; Then you need to click play. So it will replace&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdWKOUlenaY&t=671) every frame and save it in a new video. You will&nbsp; notice that the frame is increasing in here. So&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdWKOUlenaY&t=678) since my thread count is 5, the frames processed&nbsp; are increasing 5 by 5. So it is starting 5 threads&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdWKOUlenaY&t=687) and changing every frame with the new deep face&nbsp; - face swapping and it is doing that 5 at a time.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdWKOUlenaY&t=695) However, using 5 threads will use more VRAM. So&nbsp; let's see our VRAM usage. Currently, I am using&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdWKOUlenaY&t=701) 16 gigabytes, but I already have been using like 6&nbsp; gigabytes before starting this video. So 5 threads&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdWKOUlenaY&t=708) is using about 10 gigabytes GPU. So if you make it&nbsp; 1 thread, it should even work at 6 gigabyte GPUs&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdWKOUlenaY&t=715) as well. However, don't you worry because I am&nbsp; going to also make a tutorial for Massed Compute.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdWKOUlenaY&t=722) So if you don't have any powerful GPU, you will be&nbsp; able to use this application on Massed Compute. So&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdWKOUlenaY&t=729) where will be the output video saved? It will&nbsp; be saved inside output folder. When we go to&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdWKOUlenaY&t=736) the outputs folder where we did set, you will see&nbsp; that there is already a temporary video file; it&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdWKOUlenaY&t=742) is being generated. So we just need to wait. It is&nbsp; pretty fast. You see already 190 frames processed.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdWKOUlenaY&t=749) While it is processing, I will also tell you&nbsp; some of the other options. You will notice&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdWKOUlenaY&t=753) that there is Retina Face, Yolo version 8, and&nbsp; SCRDF. So these are the AI models to detect the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdWKOUlenaY&t=762) faces in the videos. If your face detection&nbsp; fails, then you can try Yolo version 8 or&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdWKOUlenaY&t=769) SCRDF. This will determine how well the face&nbsp; detection working. I strongly suggest you to&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdWKOUlenaY&t=776) install FFmpeg. Do not use OpenCV. FFmpeg works&nbsp; many times better and it will work much more&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdWKOUlenaY&t=784) faster and smoother. Everything that you need&nbsp; to install step by step explained in this video,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdWKOUlenaY&t=790) so you will be able to run this application&nbsp; very well. This is not a paywalled video;&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdWKOUlenaY&t=794) just watch it to learn it. The link of this video&nbsp; will be in the description of the video as well.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdWKOUlenaY&t=800) And after that, you can follow the instructions&nbsp; on official repository to install everything if&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdWKOUlenaY&t=805) you are not my Patreon subscriber, but I suggest&nbsp; you to become supporter of me because it will make&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdWKOUlenaY&t=811) your life much more easier and pleasant. Okay,&nbsp; so the processing has been completed; you see&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdWKOUlenaY&t=817) we are at the 509 frame, everything is done, and&nbsp; our video is saved here. It's only 14 megabytes.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdWKOUlenaY&t=825) Let's start the video and play it. I've done my&nbsp; share up there if you engage in what the federal&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdWKOUlenaY&t=830) government calls illegal activity, but what we&nbsp; call just a man trying to make a living for his&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdWKOUlenaY&t=834) family send a little moonshine liquor, and it is&nbsp; working perfectly. Let me show you the properties;&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdWKOUlenaY&t=839) so this is a full HD video. You see 1920 to 1080,&nbsp; 24 fps, 5000 kilobits per second, so this is super&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdWKOUlenaY&t=850) high quality. Currently, I am recording&nbsp; at 4K, therefore it may be looking small,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdWKOUlenaY&t=855) but on the phones, on other platforms on other&nbsp; machines, it will look perfect. This is a super&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdWKOUlenaY&t=861) high quality deep fake / face swapping. So what&nbsp; if if you want to swap images, deep fake images,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdWKOUlenaY&t=869) not videos? How to do that? To do that, click the&nbsp; image tab here. It will load the images in here&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdWKOUlenaY&t=876) that time from the selected videos folder.&nbsp; First, select your source image like this,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdWKOUlenaY&t=881) then click find faces here, then select the found&nbsp; face, then select your target face like this,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdWKOUlenaY&t=889) then enable swap faces here. After enabling the&nbsp; swap faces, make the swapper resolution to 512. It&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdWKOUlenaY&t=898) will improve; then let's enable the restorer, then&nbsp; let's select the GPEN512, which is the best one,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdWKOUlenaY&t=905) original, and this is it. This is the swapped&nbsp; face. If you are not liking it, you can play&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdWKOUlenaY&t=911) with the other options like in videos, like 200&nbsp; power, like this. You can enable Occluder, you&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdWKOUlenaY&t=919) can also enable face parser, change the mouth or&nbsp; background. Let's, for example, try 10 mouth and&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdWKOUlenaY&t=926) you will see that like that. So play with these&nbsp; options. To save your final image click save image&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdWKOUlenaY&t=933) and the saved image will be inside your outputs&nbsp; folder wherever you are saving like this. There is&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdWKOUlenaY&t=940) also one another option with the image changing,&nbsp; which is auto swap. So if you enable auto swap,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdWKOUlenaY&t=946) it says that automatically applies your currently&nbsp; selected input face to the new images, and after&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdWKOUlenaY&t=952) that, I can change my source image and it will be&nbsp; automatically applied as you are seeing right now.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdWKOUlenaY&t=958) So this is how it works. Of course, it will not&nbsp; work very well with every image. Your image has&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdWKOUlenaY&t=963) to be compatible. Your face must be compatible,&nbsp; but you see it is automatically applied. It is&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdWKOUlenaY&t=969) extremely convenient to use. From this option you&nbsp; can find the best working face and change faces,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdWKOUlenaY&t=977) then change faces in videos. So this is more&nbsp; faster, convenient way. Then click save and it&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdWKOUlenaY&t=983) will be saved inside the outputs folder. Then&nbsp; you can open the image, saved image like this.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdWKOUlenaY&t=990) The best open source available right now. So&nbsp; there is no other better application than this.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdWKOUlenaY&t=996) This works on desktop interface having systems&nbsp; right now. So you need to have either Windows&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdWKOUlenaY&t=1002) or a desktop Linux system to make it work, but&nbsp; don't worry, I am preparing installers for Massed&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdWKOUlenaY&t=1010) Compute. Currently our Massed Compute image is&nbsp; lacking few features. I messaged the authors,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdWKOUlenaY&t=1017) so after our Massed Compute image is updated,&nbsp; I will record a video for the Massed Compute&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdWKOUlenaY&t=1023) as well for who doesn't have a GPU. It is only 31&nbsp; cents per hour to use, so you will be able to use&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdWKOUlenaY&t=1030) it perfectly on there as well. Our installer zip&nbsp; file already includes Massed Compute installation,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdWKOUlenaY&t=1037) so you can use this to install it on your&nbsp; local Linux machine and Massed Compute will be&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdWKOUlenaY&t=1043) ready hopefully very soon. Thank you so much for&nbsp; watching this tutorial. I hope you have enjoyed.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdWKOUlenaY&t=1049) Please leave a comment, ask me any questions, and&nbsp; I should answer that as soon as possible. You see,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdWKOUlenaY&t=1056) you can scroll to any location and just&nbsp; wait a little bit and it will update the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdWKOUlenaY&t=1061) frame like this. So to be more successful,&nbsp; you need to have faces that are compatible.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdWKOUlenaY&t=1067) If the face is more compatible, you will get a&nbsp; better result, and it is really really good as&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdWKOUlenaY&t=1071) you are seeing right now. Thank you so much.&nbsp; Hopefully see you in another amazing tutorial.
