- [00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfuQuOk2sB0&t=17) perfect accuracy. This is Google Nano&nbsp; Banana Pro level. You see it is doing&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfuQuOk2sB0&t=22) the task with keeping image as it is&nbsp; with amazing quality, amazing accuracy,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfuQuOk2sB0&t=28) amazing high resolution. So today I will be&nbsp; showing you how to use Qwen Image Edit 2511&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfuQuOk2sB0&t=35) model and I will make a detailed comparison with&nbsp; the previous Qwen Image Edit 2509 versus Qwen&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfuQuOk2sB0&t=42) Image Edit 2511. You will love this tutorial,&nbsp; watch to the very end to learn everything.

- [00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfuQuOk2sB0&t=47) Greetings everyone. Today I am going to show&nbsp; you how to use Qwen Image Edit 2511 model with&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfuQuOk2sB0&t=54) most easiest and most accurate way on your PC&nbsp; or on cloud by using the SwarmUI. Moreover,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfuQuOk2sB0&t=62) I will compare it with the Qwen Image Edit&nbsp; 2509 model so you will see how much they&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfuQuOk2sB0&t=69) have improved. With using our Qwen Image&nbsp; Edit 2511 preset that is only 12 steps,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfuQuOk2sB0&t=77) you will be able to generate amazing quality&nbsp; images and with our one click downloader you will&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfuQuOk2sB0&t=83) download the accurate models right away. With our&nbsp; one click installer you will be able to download,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfuQuOk2sB0&t=89) install, setup and everything will work as low&nbsp; as 6 gigabyte GPUs with amazing quality. Why?&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfuQuOk2sB0&t=97) Because I have prepared an amazing quality&nbsp; FP8 scaled version of the model for you.

- [00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfuQuOk2sB0&t=103) So let's begin with the comparison of the Qwen&nbsp; Image Edit 2509 to 2511. As you can see this&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfuQuOk2sB0&t=111) is a restoration, photo restoration. Let me&nbsp; open the original and let's see the 2509. So&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfuQuOk2sB0&t=118) this is the original image. 2509 epically fails&nbsp; as you are seeing right now. I have generated 4&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfuQuOk2sB0&t=125) seeds of every image and I have picked the best&nbsp; one for every model. Let's open the 2511 and as&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfuQuOk2sB0&t=132) you can see 2511 is able to colorize and restore&nbsp; photo. So let's see comparison. This is the 2511,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfuQuOk2sB0&t=143) you can see the name here, restored photo, this&nbsp; is the original photo. So the 2511 handles this&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfuQuOk2sB0&t=150) task amazingly. Moreover, I have shared&nbsp; all the used images, prompts in this zip&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfuQuOk2sB0&t=156) file. You see it is here when you scroll down&nbsp; a little bit you will see it. Inside this zip&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfuQuOk2sB0&t=161) file you will see the case prompts. Let me open&nbsp; it. So these are the case prompts. Case 1 prompt&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfuQuOk2sB0&t=167) and when you enter inside the cases you will&nbsp; see all the images. This is the base image,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfuQuOk2sB0&t=172) this is the 2509 result and this is the&nbsp; 2511 result. So for 2509 I have used our&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfuQuOk2sB0&t=180) previous best preset. Now it is removed&nbsp; our presets because 2511 is the best one.

- [00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfuQuOk2sB0&t=185) So let's continue with the next case, image 2.&nbsp; And this is the result of the 2509. So this is&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfuQuOk2sB0&t=192) our input image and this is the generated image.&nbsp; As you can imagine the prompt is adding beard.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfuQuOk2sB0&t=199) Let's see the 2511. So the 2511 is keeping the&nbsp; face as it is as you can see. It is perfect. And&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfuQuOk2sB0&t=207) it is adding the prompt that we wanted. There is&nbsp; a massive difference between 2509 to 2511. 2511 is&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfuQuOk2sB0&t=216) next level. One another thing I have made is that&nbsp; I did set the base resolution of the model to 1920&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfuQuOk2sB0&t=224) to 1920 for these experiments. It is working&nbsp; amazing even at this resolution. Don't worry,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfuQuOk2sB0&t=230) I will show everything how to install, download&nbsp; and setup after we completed the comparison part.

- [00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfuQuOk2sB0&t=236) So the image 3 is this one. This is our base&nbsp; image and let's see the 2509. The prompt is&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfuQuOk2sB0&t=243) turning the person, the image into pixel art.&nbsp; As you can see 2509 epically fails compared&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfuQuOk2sB0&t=250) to 2511. 2511 is perfectly converting image&nbsp; into retro style pixel art as you can see.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfuQuOk2sB0&t=258) This is really really good. This is Nano&nbsp; Banana Pro level. The 4th experiment is&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfuQuOk2sB0&t=264) combining 3 images. Which 3 images? So I have&nbsp; provided all 3 images, all of these images,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfuQuOk2sB0&t=272) and I asked AI to combine them. How I asked?&nbsp; I said that put all 3 anime heroes into same&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfuQuOk2sB0&t=280) epic anime scene. So let's see the generated&nbsp; results. The left one is 2511. As you can see&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfuQuOk2sB0&t=287) it did put all 3 heroes into the scene perfectly&nbsp; accurately as you can see. However 2509 epically&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfuQuOk2sB0&t=296) fails. It puts 5 characters, the characters&nbsp; are changed. I mean this character doesn't&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfuQuOk2sB0&t=300) exist. This is not the Saitama. This is Naruto&nbsp; but somewhat different. This is a little bit&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfuQuOk2sB0&t=306) more accurate. So as you can see there is&nbsp; a massive difference between 2511 to 2509.

- [00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfuQuOk2sB0&t=313) Let's move to case 5. So the case 5 is removing&nbsp; the dog from the scene. Let's see the result&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfuQuOk2sB0&t=319) of 2509. So the 2509 changes the image almost&nbsp; entirely as you can see. The dog is removed but&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfuQuOk2sB0&t=327) the quality is very low. And let's see the result&nbsp; of the 2511. So the 2511 keeps the image as it is&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfuQuOk2sB0&t=335) as you can see with minimal amount of changes and&nbsp; it removes the dog perfectly fine. You are seeing&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfuQuOk2sB0&t=341) some quality loss because the original image&nbsp; resolution is very high. It is like 20 megapixel.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfuQuOk2sB0&t=347) Therefore it is very high resolution. However our&nbsp; outputs are like 4 megapixel. Therefore we lose&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfuQuOk2sB0&t=353) quality at very high resolution but this is really&nbsp; good. I mean this is like Nano Banana Pro level.

- [00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfuQuOk2sB0&t=360) Let's see the case 6. So the case 6 is turning&nbsp; this image into night time. Let's see the result&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfuQuOk2sB0&t=367) of 2509. So this is 2509. I mean this looks so&nbsp; artificial. It changed the image aspect ratio,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfuQuOk2sB0&t=377) zoom. So this is 2509. Let's see the 2511. The&nbsp; 2511 handles it much better. I mean there is&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfuQuOk2sB0&t=385) a magnificent difference between 2511 to&nbsp; 2509. So you see it keeps everything as&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfuQuOk2sB0&t=393) it is. It is almost perfect. So the case&nbsp; 7 is turning rabbit into purple color. So&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfuQuOk2sB0&t=398) this is the original image and this is the&nbsp; 2509. You can see that the image changed,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfuQuOk2sB0&t=404) now it is not anymore the real photo,&nbsp; everything changed. But when we see the 2511,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfuQuOk2sB0&t=411) it is next level. I mean it is trying to keep the&nbsp; image as it is with minimal amount of changes. Of&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfuQuOk2sB0&t=417) course the resolution is dropped because the&nbsp; input image is high resolution. However it&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfuQuOk2sB0&t=422) handles the task. And you are seeing it in 4K&nbsp; resolution. So when you see it on your mobile&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfuQuOk2sB0&t=428) devices or tablets or some other places you&nbsp; wouldn't even notice that this is AI made.

- [00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfuQuOk2sB0&t=434) Case 8 is changing the clothing of the&nbsp; person. So this is 2509. It changed the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfuQuOk2sB0&t=440) clothing. However the realism reduced, the&nbsp; image proportions reduced. So this is 2509.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfuQuOk2sB0&t=446) Let's see the 2511. So the 2511 is much&nbsp; more realistic. It is keeping the details,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfuQuOk2sB0&t=452) the accuracy is amazing. I prefer the 2511 all&nbsp; the way. You can see that it is keeping the image,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfuQuOk2sB0&t=460) making minimal amount of changes. Still&nbsp; I can see that the resolution is dropped&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfuQuOk2sB0&t=464) because the original image is very high&nbsp; resolution. However still this is amazing.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfuQuOk2sB0&t=469) This is excellent level. This is running&nbsp; on my PC with as low as 6 gigabyte GPUs.

- [00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfuQuOk2sB0&t=474) So the case 9 is making person holding a perfume&nbsp; bottle. So I am going to make the person to hold&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfuQuOk2sB0&t=482) this bottle. Let's see the result. So this is&nbsp; 2509. It is one of the best where 2509 did. It is&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfuQuOk2sB0&t=490) pretty good. But nothing sort of the 2511. Let's&nbsp; see the 2511. So this is the 2511. I see that the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfuQuOk2sB0&t=499) colors are not perfect in this one. However with&nbsp; more generations probably I can get better colors.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfuQuOk2sB0&t=504) But the accuracy, the face realism, the face&nbsp; shape, it is much better than the 2509. I mean&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfuQuOk2sB0&t=511) let's make a comparison. So 2509, 2511. Let's&nbsp; see base image. So this is how 2511 is making&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfuQuOk2sB0&t=521) this image holding this bottle. Very good in my&nbsp; opinion. And on low resolution you wouldn't even&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfuQuOk2sB0&t=527) notice the difference. At very high resolution it&nbsp; is still pretty good. This is a very hard task.

- [00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfuQuOk2sB0&t=532) The test case 10 is very hard. I want the model&nbsp; to redraw this input car with the style of this&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfuQuOk2sB0&t=539) input image. So let's see the result of the&nbsp; 2509. The 2509 epically fails. I mean it puts&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfuQuOk2sB0&t=546) the car into the image. It doesn't redraw&nbsp; it with the desired style. So basically we&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfuQuOk2sB0&t=552) are doing a zero shot style transfer. Let's see&nbsp; the result of the 2511. The 2511 redraws image&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfuQuOk2sB0&t=562) with perfect accuracy with the desired&nbsp; style. I mean this is next level. This&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfuQuOk2sB0&t=568) is really good. However it put the background&nbsp; but it is perfect. I mean the car, the shape,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfuQuOk2sB0&t=573) the style, everything is so perfect. This model&nbsp; shines. With the background removers you can&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfuQuOk2sB0&t=578) also remove the background if you want. Perhaps&nbsp; with prompting the background can be removed as&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfuQuOk2sB0&t=583) well. But this is perfect. This model is very&nbsp; very strong. This is Nano Banana Pro level.

- [00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfuQuOk2sB0&t=589) So the case 11 is one of the hard tasks. Turning&nbsp; image into a real photo. This is an anime image,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfuQuOk2sB0&t=596) a famous character and I want it&nbsp; to turn it into a real image. So&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfuQuOk2sB0&t=600) this is 2509. This is what it makes best. I&nbsp; tried several prompts and I am always fair,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfuQuOk2sB0&t=607) I tried same on the both models. So this is&nbsp; the result of 2509 from this image into this&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfuQuOk2sB0&t=614) realistic image. Let's see the 2511. The 2511&nbsp; does much better job. This is like a realistic&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfuQuOk2sB0&t=621) render. Yes it is not still a real person.&nbsp; However it is really really good compared&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfuQuOk2sB0&t=627) to 2509. The 2509 is much lesser detailed, the&nbsp; accuracy is lower. However 2511 is much better.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfuQuOk2sB0&t=637) You can play this character in a movie, movie&nbsp; scene. Perhaps some with additional upscales,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfuQuOk2sB0&t=643) maybe image to images it can be made certainly&nbsp; much better realistic. But the output is really&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfuQuOk2sB0&t=649) good when you consider the base image from this&nbsp; image into this image. It is really really good.

- [00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfuQuOk2sB0&t=655) Okay case 12 is turning real image into anime&nbsp; image. So 2509 epically fails. This is not like&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfuQuOk2sB0&t=664) an anime image. You can see that it fails to&nbsp; zero shot stylized image generation. However&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfuQuOk2sB0&t=672) let's see the 2511. The 2511 is perfect. As you&nbsp; can see it turned image into anime with zero shot,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfuQuOk2sB0&t=680) with perfect details, perfect accuracy.&nbsp; Everything is so good. So the 2511 is&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfuQuOk2sB0&t=686) much bigger update than people realize. It is&nbsp; really really powerful. It is really amazing.

- [00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfuQuOk2sB0&t=692) So how we are going to use this model like I do?&nbsp; As usual I have everything in this amazing post.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfuQuOk2sB0&t=699) If you don't know how to install SwarmUI,&nbsp; ComfyUI and how to use, please follow this&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfuQuOk2sB0&t=704) tutorial. First of all we will update our ComfyUI&nbsp; installation. The ComfyUI installation link will&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfuQuOk2sB0&t=710) be also in the description of the video and in&nbsp; the pinned comment, it is also here. So let's&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfuQuOk2sB0&t=715) download the latest ComfyUI zip file. This is&nbsp; mandatory. Why? Because this Qwen Image Edit&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfuQuOk2sB0&t=721) 2511 quant scaled FP8 requires a special custom&nbsp; node and my installer will auto install it. This&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfuQuOk2sB0&t=729) is not natively supported by the ComfyUI yet but&nbsp; hopefully it will be. So as usual move the latest&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfuQuOk2sB0&t=735) zip file into your installation. You can make a&nbsp; fresh installation. We have upgraded installers&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfuQuOk2sB0&t=740) to the UV so it is much faster. Extract and&nbsp; overwrite all files. This is important. Then all&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfuQuOk2sB0&t=746) you need to do is just run the Windows install&nbsp; or update ComfyUI. It will quickly update the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfuQuOk2sB0&t=752) ComfyUI to the latest version. It will install&nbsp; the new necessary custom nodes. Then we will be&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfuQuOk2sB0&t=759) able to use the latest model in our SwarmUI. So&nbsp; everything is updated, it took like 30 seconds.

- [00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfuQuOk2sB0&t=765) Then as a next step download the latest&nbsp; SwarmUI model downloader zip file. It is&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfuQuOk2sB0&t=771) 11.4 at the moment. Then move it into your SwarmUI&nbsp; installation folder as usual. You can also make&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfuQuOk2sB0&t=778) a fresh installation. Extract and overwrite&nbsp; all files. This is super important. You need&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfuQuOk2sB0&t=784) to overwrite all files. First of all you need&nbsp; to download new model. So for downloading new&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfuQuOk2sB0&t=789) model Windows start download models app.bat&nbsp; file. Our downloader is extremely fast,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfuQuOk2sB0&t=794) extremely robust. It verifies all of the&nbsp; downloaded files. We have upgraded the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfuQuOk2sB0&t=799) interface significantly. So I recommend you&nbsp; to download Qwen Image Core Bundle to not&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfuQuOk2sB0&t=804) miss any of the necessary models. You see&nbsp; it is only 56 gigabytes. Moreover it will&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfuQuOk2sB0&t=809) skip already downloaded files. After that&nbsp; you need to run the Windows update SwarmUI&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfuQuOk2sB0&t=816) to get the latest SwarmUI version. This&nbsp; is also pretty fast and it will start.

- [00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfuQuOk2sB0&t=821) After that you need to update your&nbsp; presets. You can use import preset,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfuQuOk2sB0&t=826) choose file and from there pick the latest&nbsp; preset, Amazing SwarmUI Preset version 40.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfuQuOk2sB0&t=832) Overwrite and import. Alternatively you&nbsp; can also use our preset importer which is,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfuQuOk2sB0&t=840) when your SwarmUI is running you click the Windows&nbsp; preset delete import. It will backup your preset&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfuQuOk2sB0&t=845) and it will import, click yes and all imported.&nbsp; Then click refresh. This will do a clean preset&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfuQuOk2sB0&t=852) import. It will delete all previous ones and it&nbsp; will import the newest ones. I recommend this one.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfuQuOk2sB0&t=858) Then you will have the newest Qwen Image Edit&nbsp; preset here. The downloader will download&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfuQuOk2sB0&t=863) them with 16 connections and as soon as files&nbsp; downloaded it will merge the parts and verify&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfuQuOk2sB0&t=870) hashes as you are seeing. Wait for all downloads&nbsp; to be finished and once the all downloads have&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfuQuOk2sB0&t=876) been completed go to models click refresh. Go&nbsp; to Loras click refresh or restart your SwarmUI.

- [00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfuQuOk2sB0&t=882) Then I recommend you to change the resolution.&nbsp; Because higher resolution works better with this&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfuQuOk2sB0&t=887) model so click this hamburger menu, click edit&nbsp; metadata. Set this as 1920 to 1920. Maybe even&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfuQuOk2sB0&t=895) higher may work. So after that it will auto set&nbsp; the resolution and aspect ratios accordingly.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfuQuOk2sB0&t=901) Then as usual we click quick tools, reset params&nbsp; to default, refresh. Then let's go to presets.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfuQuOk2sB0&t=908) Find the Qwen Image Edit new preset. You can&nbsp; search from here Qwen and you will see that&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfuQuOk2sB0&t=914) Qwen Image Edit 2511 direct apply. You should see&nbsp; that it is selected this Qwen Image Edit quant&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfuQuOk2sB0&t=922) model and this Qwen Image lightning Lora. This&nbsp; is the best working one don't worry about that.

- [00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfuQuOk2sB0&t=928) So how you are going to use the model? Let's&nbsp; demonstrate with 2 examples. Click this plus&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfuQuOk2sB0&t=933) icon. We are going to upload prompt image.&nbsp; So from the case images let's do this case.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfuQuOk2sB0&t=938) So this is our input image. To set the accurate&nbsp; resolution I recommend you to use this strategy.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfuQuOk2sB0&t=944) So from init image choose file, choose the&nbsp; same image, click res use closest aspect&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfuQuOk2sB0&t=951) ratio. You can also use exact aspect ratio or&nbsp; you can use exact resolution. However you need&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfuQuOk2sB0&t=957) to test. You see the exact resolution is very big&nbsp; so I am going to use closest aspect ratio. If you&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfuQuOk2sB0&t=961) make images exactly this resolution yourself&nbsp; manually it can work even better. So try to&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfuQuOk2sB0&t=967) crop images yourself to this resolution and use&nbsp; that way. Then disable this. We don't use init&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfuQuOk2sB0&t=973) image. This is only for setting the resolution.&nbsp; Don't forget that. After that type your prompt,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfuQuOk2sB0&t=979) something like this. Then generate as many&nbsp; as images you want. Let's generate 4 images.

- [00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfuQuOk2sB0&t=984) Let's also see nvitop. So nvitop will show us&nbsp; what is our GPU usage. I have RTX 5090. So the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfuQuOk2sB0&t=992) generation already starting. I recommend you&nbsp; to not run any other application while SwarmUI&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfuQuOk2sB0&t=998) is running with ComfyUI because recent ComfyUI&nbsp; versions have problems for RAM management. It&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfuQuOk2sB0&t=1005) cannot properly detect your used RAM memory.&nbsp; Therefore I recommend you to not run any other&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfuQuOk2sB0&t=1011) applications. So it is using 50 percentage&nbsp; of my RAM memory right now. It is using my&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfuQuOk2sB0&t=1016) 23 gigabyte. But don't worry since we are&nbsp; using ComfyUI backend as I have shown in&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfuQuOk2sB0&t=1021) other tutorials with SageAttention and latest&nbsp; version it is properly doing block swapping,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfuQuOk2sB0&t=1027) CPU offloading. So with 6 gigabyte&nbsp; GPUs you can run this model.

- [00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfuQuOk2sB0&t=1031) Okay the first image has been generated. It is&nbsp; amazing quality. I mean look at this quality.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfuQuOk2sB0&t=1037) This is really good. The resolution is really&nbsp; high resolution. You see it is 2288 to 1568.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfuQuOk2sB0&t=1045) We may even go with higher resolution depending&nbsp; on your input image but the result is amazing.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfuQuOk2sB0&t=1051) What about combining multiple images? Let's clear&nbsp; image. Click this plus icon. So you need to upload&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfuQuOk2sB0&t=1057) every image. So let's upload our these 3 images.&nbsp; Second one and the third one. As far as I know the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfuQuOk2sB0&t=1064) model supports up to 3 images. I didn't try 4 but&nbsp; you can try it. So for this one I am going to use&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfuQuOk2sB0&t=1071) this prompt that we have. Okay and generate. Oh&nbsp; I have forgotten to change the aspect ratio. So&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfuQuOk2sB0&t=1079) you need to set your aspect ratio according to&nbsp; your desired image. For this one since this is&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfuQuOk2sB0&t=1084) a combination of multiple images I am going to&nbsp; use 16 9. So this will be the resolution. You&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfuQuOk2sB0&t=1090) probably can combine these 3 images with other&nbsp; resolutions, other aspect ratios as well. But&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfuQuOk2sB0&t=1096) this is what I want. You can choose anyway. We&nbsp; are only doing 12 steps therefore the images&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfuQuOk2sB0&t=1101) are really fast. I mean let's see the generation&nbsp; speed. It should be done under 60 seconds on my&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfuQuOk2sB0&t=1108) GPU at this massive resolution. Okay it is getting&nbsp; done right now. Let's see the step speed from the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfuQuOk2sB0&t=1115) debug. So it is like 8.5 second per IT. You can&nbsp; reduce the steps count. It is totally fine but I&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfuQuOk2sB0&t=1124) prefer 12. You can go as low as 4 steps because&nbsp; we are actually using 4 steps Lora but 12 steps&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfuQuOk2sB0&t=1131) is yielding the best quality. Moreover when you&nbsp; use the base resolution not this bigger resolution&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfuQuOk2sB0&t=1137) it will be even faster but we are currently doing&nbsp; 4 megapixel output. Therefore it is taking more&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfuQuOk2sB0&t=1143) time than what it should take normally. However&nbsp; the quality is amazing let's see. You can also&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfuQuOk2sB0&t=1149) monitor your power usage. You should be using up&nbsp; to maximum power available like 575 to 575. This&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfuQuOk2sB0&t=1158) means that it is working with 100 percentage&nbsp; performance. There is no performance loss.

- [00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfuQuOk2sB0&t=1163) Okay and the image has been generated. This&nbsp; image took longer than the other ones. Why?&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfuQuOk2sB0&t=1169) Because as you input more images it takes more&nbsp; time. Therefore this image took 111 seconds.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfuQuOk2sB0&t=1177) This is why this one took more time. If I just&nbsp; use a single image, let's make another demo. For&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfuQuOk2sB0&t=1184) example this image. I will say that replace&nbsp; hat with a sports cap. Let's see the result.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfuQuOk2sB0&t=1192) This will be much faster than using 3 images.&nbsp; When you use more image as an input it will&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfuQuOk2sB0&t=1198) take more time. But this is the logic of how&nbsp; you use multiple images. You see it is getting&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfuQuOk2sB0&t=1203) generated much faster. It is 3.5 second IT right&nbsp; now. When it was 3 images it was 8.6 second IT.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfuQuOk2sB0&t=1212) So you see it is faster than twice. So this was&nbsp; our input image. Let me show you. By the way this&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfuQuOk2sB0&t=1218) image has been generated with our recent Wan 2.2&nbsp; tutorial. It is an amazing tutorial let me show&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfuQuOk2sB0&t=1224) you. So I recommend you to watch our latest Wan&nbsp; 2.2 tutorial on our channel. This is an amazing&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfuQuOk2sB0&t=1230) tutorial. And the generated image is here.&nbsp; I mean look at this. It is almost perfect.

- [00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfuQuOk2sB0&t=1236) So how I am comparing these images? Let's download&nbsp; this image. For image comparison I have developed&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfuQuOk2sB0&t=1242) an application. It is called as Image and Video&nbsp; Slider Application. Go to this link. It will be&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfuQuOk2sB0&t=1247) also in the description of the video. Download&nbsp; the latest zip file. Move the file wherever you&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfuQuOk2sB0&t=1252) want to install. For example let's install&nbsp; into our tutorial folder. Okay extract here.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfuQuOk2sB0&t=1258) Then install update application. It will just&nbsp; install, it is very fast. Then run the start&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfuQuOk2sB0&t=1264) image comparison. This is a very advanced&nbsp; application. You can drag and drop multiple&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfuQuOk2sB0&t=1269) files for comparison like all of these files.&nbsp; I can drag and drop them or select from here&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfuQuOk2sB0&t=1274) and it will sort them by name so it will be very&nbsp; easy. You can also change them from here. 1 PNG,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfuQuOk2sB0&t=1280) this one 2509. You can also look from here&nbsp; or you can full screen like this and you&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfuQuOk2sB0&t=1286) can compare. This is an amazing application.&nbsp; So let's compare our latest generation. So I&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfuQuOk2sB0&t=1291) am selecting both of the files. Let's do&nbsp; a full screen. Okay the right one is the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfuQuOk2sB0&t=1296) original one. The left one is the new Qwen Image&nbsp; Edit 2511. I mean this is really good quality.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfuQuOk2sB0&t=1305) It minimally changes the image. The original&nbsp; image is very high resolution that is why you&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfuQuOk2sB0&t=1309) see it is more crisp and sharp but this output is&nbsp; really really good compared to previous models.

- [00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfuQuOk2sB0&t=1316) I wonder something, if I make this even higher&nbsp; resolution what happens? So I am going to change&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfuQuOk2sB0&t=1321) the resolution to 2560 to 2560. Then select&nbsp; another model and select model so it will&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfuQuOk2sB0&t=1328) update the input resolution. This is same as the&nbsp; original image resolution. Let's see the result.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfuQuOk2sB0&t=1335) So obviously higher resolution will take more time&nbsp; but it should use the same VRAM let's see. Yes&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfuQuOk2sB0&t=1342) it is using the same VRAM amount. It will just&nbsp; take more time. I expect quality to be higher.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfuQuOk2sB0&t=1348) Let's see. Now it is taking 7.35 second. It was&nbsp; 3.53 second because we increased the resolution&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfuQuOk2sB0&t=1356) significantly. And you see my model is fully&nbsp; working with SageAttention. Both on RTX 3090&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfuQuOk2sB0&t=1363) Ti and RTX 5090. It is working on all GPUs because&nbsp; I have compiled this SageAttention myself. I have&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfuQuOk2sB0&t=1371) generated this FP8 scaled myself. This is really&nbsp; high quality almost BF16 quality. Wow it looks&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfuQuOk2sB0&t=1377) like it is going to work. Let's see. The other&nbsp; image was generated in 45 seconds. It was still&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfuQuOk2sB0&t=1384) big resolution 4 megapixels. Okay the new image&nbsp; is getting done. All VRAM management is being&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfuQuOk2sB0&t=1390) made by the ComfyUI. Okay it is done. Wow. Wow&nbsp; amazing. Let's download this and let's make a&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfuQuOk2sB0&t=1398) comparison. Wow look at this image. You see when&nbsp; you use higher resolution it is almost perfect.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfuQuOk2sB0&t=1404) From this image to this image. I mean there is&nbsp; almost no loss of quality. It did the job and&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfuQuOk2sB0&t=1410) it did amazing. I mean look at this quality&nbsp; from this to this. There is almost no quality&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfuQuOk2sB0&t=1416) loss. It minimally changed the image. It is still&nbsp; realistic as it is. So this is an amazing quality.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfuQuOk2sB0&t=1423) Therefore I recommend you to set the resolution&nbsp; to 2560 to 2560 and it will be amazing quality.

- [00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfuQuOk2sB0&t=1430) So this is it. I hope you have&nbsp; enjoyed. Please like, subscribe,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfuQuOk2sB0&t=1434) leave a comment and ask me any questions&nbsp; that you have. So it appears that the best&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfuQuOk2sB0&t=1440) resolution for this model is 2560&nbsp; to 2560 in high resolution images&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfuQuOk2sB0&t=1446) to keep the maximum quality, maximum&nbsp; accuracy. See you later hopefully.
