ComfyUI 0.3.51 changes and amazing new features and improvements full tutorial and guide. Official source : [https://blog.comfy.org/p/comfyui-035-frontend-updates](https://blog.comfy.org/p/comfyui-035-frontend-updates)

Update Logs

Hello community! With the release of ComfyUI 0.3.51, you may have noticed some major frontend changes. This is our biggest frontend update since June!

Subgraph

Subgraph is officially available in stable releases, and it now supports unpacking a subgraph back into its original nodes on the main graph.

Subgraph is:

A package of selected nodes with complete Input/Output

Looks and functions like one single "super-node"

Feels like a folder - you can dive inside and edit

A reusable module of your workflow, easy to copy and paste

And the subgraph feature is still evolving. Upcoming improvements include:

Publishing subgraphs as reusable nodes

Synchronizing updates across linked subgraph instances

Automatically generating subgraph widgets

New Manager UI

Manager is your hub for installing and managing custom nodes.

You can now access the redesigned UI by clicking “Manager Extension” in the top bar.

Mini Map

Easier canvas navigation by moving around with the Mini Map.

Standard Navigation Mode

We’ve added a new standard navigation mode to the frontend:

Use the mouse wheel to scroll across the canvas

Switch back to the legacy zoom mode anytime in the settings

Tab Preview

Tabs now support previews, so you can check them without switching.

Shortcut Panel

See all shortcuts in the shortcut panel. Any changes you make are updated in real time.

Help Center

Stay informed of the release information by checking changelogs directly in the Help Center.

We know there are still areas to improve, and we’ve received tons of valuable feedback from the community.

We’ll continue refining the experience in upcoming versions.

As always, enjoy creating with ComfyUI!
