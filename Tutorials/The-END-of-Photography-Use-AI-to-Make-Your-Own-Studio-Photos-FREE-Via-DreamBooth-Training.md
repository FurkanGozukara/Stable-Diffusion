Dreambooth is the best training method for Stable Diffusion. In this tutorial, I show how to install the Dreambooth extension of Automatic1111 Web UI from scratch. Additionally, I demonstrate my months of work on the realism workflow, which enables you to produce studio-quality images of yourself through #Dreambooth training. Furthermore, I share my automatic installer script for the DreamBooth extension.

The generative AI along with LLMs are going to cause huge unemployment. Looks like #photography is going to be one of the early goners.

Moreover if you are having hard time to install and use DreamBooth, this tutorial is the best place that will teach you both automatically and manually installing the extension.

- [00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=48) You can possibly use on your official documents or wherever you need studio shot quality images.

- [00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=56) This will save tons of time of yours.

- [00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=59) This will save you huge amount of money.

- [00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=61) So this tutorial will teach you how to obtain amazing realism.

- [00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=68) So I have prepared an amazing GitHub readme file for this tutorial.

- [00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=73) Every information, links and commands will be in this file.

- [00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=78) This file will be the primary source.

- [00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=80) As it be necessary, I will update this readme file.

- [00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=83) The link for this readme file will be in the description of the video and also in the comment

- [00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=88) section of the video.

- [00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=89) When you click here, you will get to my Stable Diffusion repository.

- [00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=94) I am posting a lot of useful stuff here.

- [00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=97) So please star it, fork it and watch it and check out the links and descriptions that

- [00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=102) I put here.

- [00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=104) So we will begin with installing the DreamBooth extension of Automatic1111 web UI.

- [00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=109) If you don't know what is DreamBooth training and if you wonder and if you want to learn

- [00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=113) more details, watch this tutorial that I have put the link here.

- [00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=118) To be able to follow this tutorial, you need to have Python and Git installed.

- [00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=123) If you don't know how to install Python and Git, look out for this tutorial video that

- [00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=128) I linked here.

- [00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=129) You can download the Python 3.10.9 version from here and Git from here.

- [00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=134) If you don't know how to install Automatic1111 Stable Diffusion web UI, I made a recent video

- [00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=140) and in the first 15 minutes, I have explained how to install it very detailed.

- [00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=146) So watch this tutorial for that.

- [00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=148) We will use realistic vision version 2 for this tutorial as a base training model.

- [00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=153) The link is here to download it.

- [00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=156) So I will show both automatic installation and manual installation.

- [00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=160) I have prepared an auto-installer script.

- [00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=163) When you open this link, you will get to this: Patreon post that I have downloaded part 1

- [00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=169) and part 2.bat files.

- [00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=170) Don't worry, I will also show manual installation as well step by step.

- [00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=175) So let's make a new folder in my c drive.

- [00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=178) DreamBooth tutorial.

- [00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=179) Let's make two folders, auto, manual.

- [00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=182) For auto installation, copy paste the downloaded bat files here.

- [00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=187) First execute part 1.

- [00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=189) It will ask you to run it.

- [00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=191) Click more info, run anyway.

- [00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=194) You can right click the bat file, edit and see what is inside it like this.

- [00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=199) So here I have my manual installation of Stable Diffusion web UI.

- [00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=203) Let's say you want to use the exact version that I have used for this tutorial.

- [00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=209) Then after cloning your Automatic1111 web UI, execute this git checkout command.

- [00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=216) Open a cmd window inside here, copy paste it, and you will get to this checkpoint.

- [00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=222) Then do a fresh installation.

- [00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=224) So download the realistic vision model from this link.

- [00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=227) When you click it, you will see it will start downloading like this.

- [00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=231) Put the downloaded realistic vision model into your models folder.

- [00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=235) Don't forget to join our Discord channel for any kind of help and also discussions with

- [00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=240) other expert people we have.

- [00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=242) Click this link.

- [00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=244) From here join our server.

- [00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=246) Automatic installation part 1 has been completed.

- [00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=248) I closed the cmd window.

- [00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=250) Then start part 2.

- [00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=252) Click more info, run anyway.

- [00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=254) When you see the url like this, it means that the first part of the automatic installation

- [00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=259) has been completed.

- [00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=260) And now automatic installation will automatically clone the DreamBooth extension and install

- [00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=266) everything automatically for you.

- [00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=268) Manual installation is also ready.

- [00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=270) So let's say you already have an existing Automatic1111 web UI instance.

- [00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=276) You don't have to do a fresh installation.

- [00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=278) All you need to do is start a cmd window, do git pull which will update the Automatic1111

- [00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=284) web UI to the latest version.

- [00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=286) If you get a message like this, then do git checkout master and then do git pull again.

- [00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=293) And it will update everything to the latest.

- [00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=296) Let's say you have previously installed DreamBooth extension.

- [00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=300) Then go to the extensions folder and delete it.

- [00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=303) This is important.

- [00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=304) You have to be inside this folder.

- [00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=306) Open a new cmd window.

- [00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=309) Copy the command written on the readme file here.

- [00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=312) Paste it and hit enter and it will clone it.

- [00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=315) Let's say you want to use the version I used in this tutorial.

- [00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=319) Then what you need to do is executing this command, copy it, move into sd DreamBooth

- [00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=325) extension folder like this, then execute here.

- [00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=328) And then you will use the same version that I used for this tutorial.

- [00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=332) Why this is important?

- [00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=334) Because sometimes the extensions may get broken temporarily and when you are watching this

- [00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=340) tutorial, if it doesn't work, you can use the exact versions that I have used.

- [00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=344) Then close this window, move into your main installation folder, go to virtual environment

- [00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=350) folder venv, go to inside scripts folder, open a new cmd window here, copy this, activate

- [00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=358) and type it and it will be activated.

- [00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=360) You see now the virtual environment is activated.

- [00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=363) I have explained a lot of details about virtual environments in this tutorial video.

- [00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=368) Then execute these commands one by one.

- [00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=371) Copy this, paste, hit enter, paste, hit enter, then copy this, paste, hit enter, and then

- [00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=378) copy this, and paste, hit enter.

- [00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=381) And it will install all of the requirements of the DreamBooth extension.

- [00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=384) This is the most proper way of installing DreamBooth extension.

- [00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=388) Do not install it from extensions tab of the Automatic1111 web UI.

- [00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=393) Close your Automatic1111 web UI and follow the steps that I have shown here.

- [00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=399) So what is the benefit of using my automatic installer?

- [00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=402) If there be an error.

- [00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=403) Just leave a comment here and I will update the scripts and you will get the most up-to-date

- [00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=409) fixed script file and you won't have any issues.

- [00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=413) Alternatively, leave a comment to this video and hopefully I will update this readme file

- [00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=418) and fix the issue for you.

- [00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=420) So now we can use both automatic and manual installation.

- [00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=423) I will continue with automatic Stable Diffusion and DreamBooth installation.

- [00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=427) I will start my web UI instance.

- [00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=429) The web UI has started.

- [00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=431) You see the commit hash and the DreamBooth hash revisions here.

- [00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=435) When you open your interface, you will see the DreamBooth tab.

- [00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=439) So let's begin with creating our model.

- [00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=441) Click the create tab, give a name, any name.

- [00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=444) This doesn't matter.

- [00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=445) Me Best realism: select your source checkpoint.

- [00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=449) Click refresh icon here If you don't see the model.

- [00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=452) Select realistic vision.

- [00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=453) This is for realism.

- [00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=455) Check unfreeze model.

- [00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=456) You may wonder why check this? because this is slightly improving the quality.

- [00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=460) I have done over 30 different experimentation to find the best parameters.

- [00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=466) Hit create model: follow what is happening in your cmd window.

- [00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=469) This is important.

- [00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=471) Also, in the very bottom of my interface you see it displays version of the Automatic1111

- [00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=477) web UI, python, torch, and xFormers.

- [00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=480) Currently my xFormers version is the latest version.

- [00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=484) Why?

- [00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=485) Because the automatic script automatically upgrades the xFormers to the latest version.

- [00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=489) If you don't know how to upgrade it to latest version, watch this tutorial.

- [00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=494) If you don't see any progress in your cmd window, hit enter because it means that it

- [00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=498) was frozen and then it will continue to display messages and continue operation.

- [00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=503) Okay checkpoint successfully extracted.

- [00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=505) You can see where the extracted model files are stored.

- [00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=509) It is inside in this folder.

- [00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=512) Let me open it.

- [00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=513) So here the extracted model files.

- [00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=516) This is where Stable Diffusion training model files are saved in this folder.

- [00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=521) You can see with the name of your training model and other variables are her.

- [00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=527) In this folder you will find the native diffuser files.

- [00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=531) So based on these diffuser files it will continue do training, continue doing fine tuning.

- [00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=538) You see all of the files are here.

- [00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=540) Okay, then select your model.

- [00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=542) When you first time create your model, it will automatically select the freshly composed

- [00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=546) model like this.

- [00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=547) Later time if you want to continue then you need to select your model from here.

- [00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=551) It shows the loaded model, model revision, model epoch, and the source checkpoint used

- [00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=557) to compose this model.

- [00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=559) I will show the best settings for the best possible realism.

- [00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=564) This is usually best settings for fine tuning and other tasks as well.

- [00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=568) So what matters for best realism is the used base model, used resolution and used images

- [00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=574) quality.

- [00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=575) I will explain all of them.

- [00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=577) First click performance wizard then click train wizard person.

- [00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=580) I train up to 200 epochs.

- [00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=583) Save model frequency is 10.

- [00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=585) So with each 10 epochs we will save our model.

- [00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=588) I am not saving any previews anymore, it is just slowing us down.

- [00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=593) I use x/y/z plot to find the best checkpoint.

- [00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=597) I will show you how to do that.

- [00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=598) For training the best possible realism I suggest you to use batch size 1 and gradient accumulation

- [00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=604) steps 1.

- [00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=605) Class batch size doesn't matter because you should never use DreamBooth extension to generate

- [00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=610) your classification images.

- [00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=611) Either you should use pre-made classification images or use text to image to generate your

- [00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=616) classification images.

- [00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=618) I don't check gradient checkpointing because I have 24 gigabyte VRAM having gpu, but I

- [00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=622) will also show the best settings for 12 gigabyte having gpus as well.

- [00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=628) So the learning rate will be 1e-7 this is important.

- [00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=631) Make the learning rate 1e-7 both for UNET and text encoder learning 1e-7.

- [00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=639) Image processing.

- [00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=640) Now this is really important.

- [00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=641) As higher as you go with training max resolution you will get better results, but max resolution

- [00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=649) also depends on your base trained model.

- [00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=652) Realistic vision has a very good resolution, but probably the max we can go is 1024 so

- [00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=660) make this 1024 like this.

- [00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=662) Do not select apply horizontal flip or dynamic image normalization.

- [00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=666) I tested this and they are decreasing the quality.

- [00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=669) Use EMA.

- [00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=671) Select Lion.

- [00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=672) I tested all of this and Lion is the best one that's for sure.

- [00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=676) Select mixed precision bf16.

- [00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=678) If your graphic card do not support this.

- [00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=680) You can also select fp16.

- [00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=683) I will continue with bf16.

- [00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=684) Do not use xFormers.

- [00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=686) This is also decreasing the training quality.

- [00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=689) Cache latents.

- [00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=690) Train UNET.

- [00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=691) Step ratio of text encoder is 75%.

- [00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=694) Offset noise is used to have more contrast of the output images.

- [00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=700) I don't find this useful for training yourself, but you can try this with like this.

- [00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=705) Freeze clip normalizations layers.

- [00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=707) This is not also improving so do not check it.

- [00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=710) Clip skip 1 for training yourself.

- [00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=712) Now this is important.

- [00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=714) Weight decay.

- [00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=715) This will be 10%.

- [00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=717) You see I did set a lower learning rate and higher weight decay.

- [00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=721) Why?

- [00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=722) Because I am using Lion optimizer.

- [00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=724) So these learning rates and these weight decays are set for Lion.

- [00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=728) So apply everything like I am doing.

- [00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=731) Do not touch anything else here.

- [00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=733) Keep them as they are.

- [00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=735) Now concept tabs.

- [00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=736) This is really important.

- [00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=737) In the dataset directory we will set our training images folder path.

- [00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=742) Here I have preprocessed different dimension images of myself.

- [00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=747) How did I prepare them?

- [00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=748) I used my human cropping script which I have shown in this video and prepared automatically

- [00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=755) different aspect ratios.

- [00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=756) For most realism we need the highest resolution with 768 by 1024.

- [00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=764) These are the raw images.

- [00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=766) They are bigger than 768 and 1024.

- [00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=770) Then I used the train tab.

- [00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=772) In here, preprocess images.

- [00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=774) Set the source directory.

- [00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=775) For example let's set this like this and here let's set another folder as a destination.

- [00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=781) So I will set the destination here.

- [00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=784) Let's make it as new train.

- [00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=787) Set the width and height of the images.

- [00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=789) Select auto focal point crop, focal point face weight 1, and preprocess.

- [00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=795) I am not using captions for training a person.

- [00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=799) It is not improving the realism.

- [00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=802) So here now we have our new training images.

- [00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=805) They are processed.

- [00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=807) They were already properly cropped for the correct aspect ratio.

- [00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=812) So when I click view details and sort by width and height, we can see the width and height

- [00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=819) of the images like this.

- [00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=821) They are ready to be used.

- [00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=823) So the most important part of DreamBooth training for realism is the training images data set.

- [00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=830) This data set is at best medium quality.

- [00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=833) Why?

- [00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=834) Because I have repeating backgrounds and repeating clothing.

- [00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=837) So as you have more diverse backgrounds and clothing, it is better.

- [00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=843) Whatever is repeating in the training images, the model will memorize them.

- [00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=848) Therefore you will have lesser flexibility.

- [00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=851) However, even this data set works very well for realism.

- [00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=855) So if you use a better data set then it will be better.

- [00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=858) In your images the sharpness of the image should be very good.

- [00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=862) It must have very high quality.

- [00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=864) It must have good lightning.

- [00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=866) So capture your training images during daytime when you have sufficient amount of lightning.

- [00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=872) This is really important.

- [00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=873) Your images should be sharp.

- [00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=875) Your images should be high quality.

- [00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=878) Sharp focus, clear, not blurry, not anything else.

- [00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=881) So the most important part, as I said, the training images quality.

- [00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=886) Prepare different backgrounds and clothing having images.

- [00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=889) This is at best a medium quality data set.

- [00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=892) Okay, let's return back to our DreamBooth tab.

- [00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=895) Let's select data set directory.

- [00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=897) So I copy here, paste it here and training images data set is ready.

- [00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=902) Then classification images.

- [00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=904) This is a commonly asked question to me.

- [00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=906) What is classification images for.

- [00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=908) The classification images will prevent model from overtraining and also it is used to keep

- [00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=916) the model previous knowledge.

- [00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=919) Therefore, normally you need to generate your classification images by using the model itself.

- [00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=925) Let's say we are going to use class prompt as a man and you may wonder, what is this

- [00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=931) man, what is this classification images and everything?

- [00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=935) I explain all these concepts in this amazing tutorial video.

- [00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=940) So watch this video to learn more about classification images and rare tokens and other concepts.

- [00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=947) Since our target is realism, I will fine tune the model with real images.

- [00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=954) So with the classification of real images, the model will become even more realistic

- [00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=958) and I will get better results.

- [00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=961) So here my preprocessed images.

- [00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=963) I will use 768 by 1024 pixel images.

- [00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=967) So here my data set.

- [00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=969) These are collected from unsplash.com.

- [00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=972) These are available to use even for commercial purposes.

- [00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=976) You see these are real images.

- [00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=978) They are super high quality.

- [00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=979) Let me open some of them for you.

- [00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=982) Here an example image.

- [00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=984) Here another example image.

- [00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=986) By using these real images, I will improve the realism of my model and I will prevent

- [00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=993) overtraining.

- [00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=994) So with these images, I will obtain the maximum realism from this training.

- [00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1000) This classification images data set is shared on this post.

- [00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1005) You can alternatively also watch this tutorial video and prepare your own classification

- [00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1009) images data set as well.

- [00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1011) Let's say you want to use the model itself classification images.

- [00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1015) Then you can generate classification images with photo of man, set the resolution the

- [00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1021) half of the target resolution so it will be 384 by 512.

- [00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1026) Then apply high resolution fix why?

- [00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1030) Because this way you will get higher resolution, better quality classification images data

- [00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1035) set.

- [00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1036) For example this is an example image but it has some noise as you are seeing with high

- [00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1041) resolution data set.

- [00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1042) So right click here and generate forever as many as classification images you want, then

- [00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1048) move them into another folder and give its path.

- [00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1051) However for realism, real images performing better.

- [00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1055) So I will copy the path of this classification images data set here.

- [00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1059) I don't use file words instance token or class token.

- [00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1063) I use training prompt so it will be ohwx man, this will be my instance prompt.

- [00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1070) Ohwx is our rare token.

- [00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1073) Man is our class token.

- [00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1075) So we teach ourselves into ohwx rare token and we leverage the knowledge of man token

- [00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1083) of the model.

- [00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1084) The class prompt will be also man.

- [00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1087) Because my classification images are all man.

- [00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1090) Let's say you also wanted to use captions for your images.

- [00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1093) Then all you need to do is adding here [filewords].

- [00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1098) So it will read the captions and append them to here and this will be your final instance

- [00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1103) prompt when during training.

- [00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1105) You can prepare captions from train, preprocess and here you can use BLIP for caption or deepbooru

- [00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1113) for caption.

- [00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1114) For example, let me show you use BLIP for caption.

- [00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1117) There are also other captionings, but I find the captioning is necessary for fine tuning,

- [00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1123) not teaching a style, or for not teaching a subject.

- [00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1127) In this case, we are teaching ourselves as subject.

- [00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1130) Therefore, I don't find using captions is better.

- [00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1134) So new train2, preprocess.

- [00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1137) When you first time use captioning, it will download the used model.

- [00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1140) In this case it is BLIP and here our second training data set with captions.

- [00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1145) When you open caption file you will see a description, a man with glasses and a blue

- [00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1151) shirt is standing in front of a building and a street light and street light.

- [00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1155) So you see the class token is already exists in my caption.

- [00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1160) Therefore, if class token exists in all of the captions, remove it from here.

- [00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1166) So when this file is read, what will be the instance prompt.

- [00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1170) The instance prompt will be equal to this one.

- [00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1173) It will just append the file words to here.

- [00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1176) However, as I said, I don't find it better to use because it will diverse your training

- [00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1182) and it will take your model away from realism.

- [00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1186) In realism training, we want to model to learn as much as the details of our face.

- [00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1194) And the class prompt is man and class images per instance.

- [00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1197) Now this is important.

- [00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1199) I use 100.

- [00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1201) Therefore, since I have 13 training images, I need 1300 classification images.

- [00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1208) How many I have in my folder?

- [00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1210) I have 2700 classification images.

- [00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1213) Therefore, calculate your number of classification images that you need.

- [00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1218) Generate them from here.

- [00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1219) Open the folder, look how many you have, move them into another folder and use them as a

- [00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1226) classification images.

- [00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1227) However, you won't get as good as results as using the real images.

- [00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1233) Because when we use real images like these are.

- [00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1236) Actually we are further fine-tuning the base model with these new images for this token.

- [00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1243) So it becomes even more realistic.

- [00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1246) Better quality for man token.

- [00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1248) I don't use any sample prompts because I will check the each checkpoint with x/y/z plot

- [00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1254) I will show.

- [00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1255) So these are the settings of concept tab.

- [00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1258) Data set directory for training images.

- [00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1261) Classification dataset directory for classification, regularization images.

- [00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1265) Filewords these are empty.

- [00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1267) Training prompts ohwx man.

- [00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1269) Class prompt man.

- [00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1270) If you are training woman, then this is woman.

- [00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1273) If you are training girl, then this is girl.

- [00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1275) If you are training boy, then this is boy.

- [00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1277) Moreover, you should also clear the bad images from your classification images.

- [00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1283) In the saving tab do not save EMA weights for generated model.

- [00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1286) This is not improving the quality.

- [00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1290) Generate a ckpt file when saving during training.

- [00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1292) By the way, not anymore it is generating ckpt.

- [00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1295) It is generating safetensors file.

- [00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1297) It is same but this is the safe version.

- [00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1300) So these are the saving options.

- [00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1303) Always save settings, then click load settings.

- [00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1306) After loading settings verify that all of them are correct or not.

- [00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1311) Training steps per epochs, same model frequency: 10.

- [00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1314) Batch size 1.

- [00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1316) Gradient 1.

- [00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1317) Set gradients to none when zeroing.

- [00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1319) Gradient checkpointing not selected.

- [00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1320) Learning rate, text encoder rate, max resolution this is important.

- [00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1324) Make sure that it is 1024.

- [00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1326) Also, make sure that your classification images and training images are also at this resolution.

- [00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1333) If you don't increase this resolution, then the DreamBooth extension will downscale them

- [00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1338) first.

- [00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1339) Then start training.

- [00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1340) So you won't get this much high resolution quality.

- [00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1343) Use EMA.

- [00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1344) This is important.

- [00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1345) Lion bf16, memory attention default, cache latents, train UNET.

- [00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1350) Offset noise 0.

- [00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1351) Clip skip 1.

- [00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1352) Weight decay 10%.

- [00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1354) Text encoder weight decay 10%.

- [00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1356) I also tested this text encoder gradient clip normalization.

- [00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1360) This didn't improve my results.

- [00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1362) Concept tabs looking correct.Training images, classification images, dataset training prompts

- [00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1367) correct.

- [00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1368) Don't use other words here.

- [00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1371) Because rare token logic is very important.

- [00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1375) And as I said, if you don't know rare token logic, please watch this video.

- [00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1379) This will help you tremendously.

- [00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1381) Okay, everything is looking good then hit train.

- [00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1385) Currently my VRAM usage is like this as you are seeing right now.

- [00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1389) First it will start with preprocessing and looking for the classification images whether

- [00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1394) they are correct dimension or not and every one of them is in the correct dimension so

- [00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1399) it should work very well.

- [00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1401) First, it will look for the classification images and preprocess them if they are not

- [00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1406) in the correct dimension.

- [00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1408) It took like four to five seconds to preprocess my classification images.

- [00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1412) It says that it has found 1300 regularization images which was the necessary number.

- [00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1419) Why?

- [00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1420) Because we have 13 training images and we are using 100 classification images per instance

- [00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1425) image.

- [00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1426) Therefore, we need 1300 classification regularization images.

- [00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1431) Since it has found all of the necessary classification images, it didn't generate any new ones.

- [00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1436) However, if we didn't have sufficient amount of them, it would use these settings to generate

- [00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1443) those missing number of classification images based on the class prompt here.

- [00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1449) However, as I said, do not depend on this.

- [00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1453) Use text to image tab to generate your classification images.

- [00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1456) It is better.

- [00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1457) Always watch this cmd window to see what is happening.

- [00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1461) This rule applies both on windows on linux, on RunPod, wherever you are doing your training,

- [00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1468) always look at the cmd window that you started your web UI.

- [00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1471) Now it is caching latents.

- [00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1473) It is caching both classification images and training images.

- [00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1477) Therefore, 1313 images are being cached in the gpu VRAM memory.

- [00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1483) So caching latents will increase your VRAM memory usage.

- [00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1487) Caching latents has been completed and now it started training.

- [00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1491) You see the training will going to take about 6 hours to be completed for 200 epochs.

- [00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1497) It is using 19 gigabytes VRAM.

- [00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1500) Why?

- [00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1501) Because we are not using gradient checkpointing, we are not using xFormers and we are using

- [00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1507) 1024 pixels resolution and we are using EMA.

- [00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1513) All of these are increasing the VRAM usage and decreasing our training speed.

- [00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1519) However, these are necessary for maximum quality training, and when you consider that you don't

- [00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1525) have to go to a photo studio anymore, this is much more convenient both economically

- [00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1531) and from both timing and the results perspective.

- [00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1535) By the way, currently I am recording a video.

- [00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1539) Therefore it is also using a lot of GPU and VRAM of the GPU as well.

- [00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1544) Moreover, I am using Nvidia broadcast for reducing the noise and this is also using

- [00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1551) a lot of GPU.

- [00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1553) What if if you don't have such powerful GPU for such quality training, don't you worry.

- [00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1559) I have two excellent tutorials that shows you how to use Stable Diffusion and DreamBooth

- [00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1564) on RunPod.

- [00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1565) First one is this one and second one is this one.

- [00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1568) I even have automatic DreamBooth installer on RunPod.

- [00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1571) In this post it is shared.

- [00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1573) Follow this video to install DreamBooth on RunPod.

- [00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1577) For doing this training you don't even need a powerful GPU from RunPod.

- [00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1581) Just rent RTX3090.

- [00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1583) It is 29 cents per hour and with like spending two or three dollars you can have your amazing

- [00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1590) trained model, then download it and use it on your computer or on Google Colab.

- [00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1596) Wherever you want after you have done the training.

- [00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1599) Everything is same on RunPod.

- [00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1601) Just watch these two tutorials and you will be able to do everything I have shown in this

- [00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1607) video also on RunPod.

- [00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1609) Meanwhile our training is continuing.

- [00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1611) I had done exact same training previously me best.

- [00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1615) So I have a lot of checkpoints and I have no idea which one is the best.

- [00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1619) Therefore now I will show you checkpoint comparison.

- [00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1623) Select like the middle like 100 epoch like this.

- [00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1627) Decide your prompt.

- [00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1628) I will use this prompt.

- [00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1630) This is from the readme file.

- [00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1631) I will use this negative prompt.

- [00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1634) Now since we have done our training in 1024 you should select with 768 and height 1024.

- [00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1643) This is really important and that's all you need.

- [00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1647) Now generate some images and we will pick good seeds to do x/y/z comparison.

- [00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1653) So I am making batch count 100.

- [00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1656) We got the 100 output.

- [00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1658) Now we will select few good seeds and we will do x/y/z checkpoint comparison.

- [00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1665) So let's find some good seeds for comparing.

- [00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1668) Okay, this is a decent seed so I will look for the seed and save it.

- [00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1673) This is the seed.

- [00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1674) I copy paste it into a notepad file.

- [00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1677) Let's continue.

- [00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1678) Okay this is another decent seed.

- [00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1680) Let's also copy it.

- [00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1682) Paste it here.

- [00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1683) Continue.

- [00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1684) You can find up to 9 seeds or 4 seeds.

- [00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1687) It's up to you.

- [00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1688) Wow this is very interesting one.

- [00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1690) The face is almost like me but it has added more hair.

- [00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1695) I will test this.

- [00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1696) Here the seed.

- [00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1697) This usually don't happen when you aim for realism.

- [00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1701) The face is very good and it has also extra hair.

- [00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1704) Okay this is another decent seed.

- [00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1706) So I have got four seeds for experimentation.

- [00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1709) Then make the batch size 1.

- [00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1712) Go to scripts: x/y/z plot, copy, paste the seeds like this.

- [00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1717) Select the checkpoint names.

- [00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1718) From here you should select the checkpoints with the order that will be easier for you.

- [00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1723) So I will start from epoch 10.

- [00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1725) Why epoch 10 is 260?

- [00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1729) Because I have 13 training images.

- [00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1732) Therefore for one epoch it has to do 13 steps because in each step since batch size is 1,

- [00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1740) it will train one image.

- [00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1742) But I also have classification images.

- [00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1745) Thus, it is double of the required step.

- [00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1749) So 260 is 10 epoch, then 20 epoch, 30 epoch 40, 50, 60, 70.

- [00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1756) I am selecting all of the epochs with the order they are like this.

- [00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1763) Up to 200 epochs.

- [00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1765) So all epochs are selected.

- [00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1767) Make the grid margins like 100.

- [00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1769) It will be easier to see and nothing else.

- [00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1773) Hit generate.

- [00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1774) Now it will generate x/y/z plot comparison with the selected seeds so we will be able

- [00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1781) to see which checkpoint is performing best.

- [00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1785) You see in the first checkpoint.

- [00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1787) It is not even like me.

- [00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1789) As the training continues and more epochs are trained, the images will become more like

- [00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1795) me.

- [00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1796) When doing x/y/z comparison, make sure that the VAE file and the model files are correctly

- [00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1803) loaded.

- [00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1804) There aren't any errors.

- [00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1805) Also, if you have noticed I am using VAE ft 840000 ema pruned ckpt as VAE file.

- [00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1814) This is the best VAE file.

- [00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1817) It will significantly improve your image generation output.

- [00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1821) This is not used during training, it is used during inference.

- [00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1826) If you don't know how to install and use that VAE file.

- [00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1829) If you don't know how to set these quick settings, then watch the first 15 minutes of this tutorial

- [00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1836) and you will learn all of them.

- [00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1837) The x/y/z plot generation is completed.

- [00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1840) When we click the image, it will show us the entire image.

- [00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1845) However, looking it from the folder is better.

- [00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1848) Click this folder icon.

- [00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1850) You see it has opened text to image images.

- [00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1853) But we need to check out text to image grids.

- [00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1856) Here.

- [00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1857) The grid file will be saved here.

- [00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1859) So in the very bottom we see our latest generated grid file.

- [00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1864) Let's open it inpaint.net and let's zoom it to original resolution.

- [00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1869) So it starts from the epoch 10.

- [00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1872) Let's look epoch 10 nothing like me.

- [00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1874) This is epoch 20.

- [00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1876) This is epoch 30.

- [00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1877) In epoch 30 a little bit like me.

- [00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1880) Epoch 40 you are seeing right now.

- [00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1883) Epoch 50.

- [00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1885) Okay, epoch 60.

- [00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1887) The face is very similar to me.

- [00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1890) 70 yeah, not bad.

- [00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1892) 80.

- [00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1893) This is epoch 80.

- [00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1894) Epoch 90 as you are seeing right now: epoch 100.

- [00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1900) This is the epoch 100.

- [00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1902) Epoch 110.

- [00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1904) This is the epoch we used to find these seeds as you are seeing right now they are the same,

- [00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1911) okay 120 epoch.

- [00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1912) So by looking all of this you need to find your best checkpoint.

- [00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1917) Then we will use that checkpoint to generate images.

- [00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1921) You see as the epochs goes more it is changing and it is more becoming like me as you are

- [00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1927) seeing right now.

- [00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1928) This is epoch 150.

- [00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1930) Actually, this was the epoch I found best.

- [00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1934) Then 160 as you are seeing right now.

- [00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1937) So the quality begins degrading I think.

- [00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1940) You see the face is better here than here I think.

- [00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1943) Also better here than here.

- [00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1946) So you need to find your own best epoch.

- [00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1949) This totally depends on your training images data set, therefore I can't say it will best

- [00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1956) with you.

- [00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1958) However, up to 200 epochs is usually sufficient to find a sweet spot.

- [00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1964) Actually, after 110 I think all epochs can be used, but you see now we are starting to

- [00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1970) get some noise at the epoch 200 so it started to overtrain at the 200 epoch.

- [00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1976) That is for sure.

- [00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1978) That hair is also gone, the face is degraded, so that is why I prefer to go to up to 200

- [00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1985) epochs and then find the best one with this way.

- [00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1988) I think this is the best epoch 150.

- [00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1991) The face is there.

- [00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1994) It is very high quality.

- [00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=1995) After you decide your epoch, select it from here.

- [00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=2000) Turn off the x/y/z plot, then hit generate forever.

- [00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=2005) You can also add different prompts here.

- [00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=2008) Try different prompts but why generate forever?

- [00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=2011) I will explain you the logic of that.

- [00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=2014) So in this folder I have over 2000 generated images but they have a different numbering

- [00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=2023) and there are some values you are seeing there.

- [00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=2027) These images are sorted based on the similarity to my real images.

- [00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=2033) This makes my job much easier to find higher quality images.

- [00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=2038) Much easier.

- [00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=2039) So by sorting images based on the similarity and by generating hundreds or thousands of

- [00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=2046) images, you can get very high quality images very easily that you can use in your Linkedin,

- [00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=2053) Twitter, or wherever you want.

- [00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=2055) Very like you with very high quality.

- [00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=2058) Like they are taken in a studio shot like they are a professional photograph by wearing

- [00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=2064) high quality suit.

- [00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=2065) So how did I sort them.

- [00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=2068) In this tutorial video I explained how to sort all of the images.

- [00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=2074) Everything is explained here.

- [00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=2076) I already have a Patreon post that includes script but you don't have to be my Patreon

- [00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=2082) supporter to obtain the scripts.

- [00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=2084) Everything is explained in this tutorial very clearly.

- [00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=2087) So can these images be further improved?

- [00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=2090) Yes.

- [00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=2091) You have inpainting option.

- [00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=2093) There are two ways to improve generated images.

- [00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=2096) However, when you use inpainting I think it is not reaching the level of the raw output.

- [00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=2103) Therefore, hopefully I am planning a fine-tuned model with better resolution than the realistic

- [00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=2110) vision and do higher resolution training on that new fine-tuned model.

- [00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=2115) Hopefully I will make a tutorial video for that and release the model as well.

- [00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=2120) So with that model, hopefully we will be able to do training with even higher resolution

- [00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=2125) and obtain better quality.

- [00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=2127) But for now with realistic vision this is the resolution I think we can go up to.

- [00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=2132) Click send to inpaint.

- [00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=2134) There are two options of inpainting.

- [00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=2136) The first one is using the native inpainting of the Automatic1111 web UI.

- [00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=2143) Select the face select only masked and very important thing here is only masked padding

- [00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=2149) pixels.

- [00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=2150) This will determine your output.

- [00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=2153) This will affect your output significantly.

- [00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=2156) So let's try with default values first.

- [00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=2158) Okay, this is the default values first try as you are seeing.

- [00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=2162) Let's open it in a new tab.

- [00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=2164) Then let's make the padding pixels 64.

- [00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=2168) As you increase padding pixels, you will likely to get better image.

- [00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=2172) However, there is a sweet spot so this is 64 pixels.

- [00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=2176) You see from this to this.

- [00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=2177) This is looking better.

- [00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=2179) Then let's try 96.

- [00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=2181) So you should try different padding pixels until you get the best result.

- [00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=2186) Okay here it is.

- [00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=2187) From this to this to this this is 96.

- [00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=2191) This is 64.

- [00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=2192) 64 is so far best.

- [00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=2193) Let's say 128.

- [00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=2195) By the way these are not cherry-picked this is the first result that we are getting.

- [00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=2200) So with doing multiple times generation you can get even better ones.

- [00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=2204) This.

- [00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=2205) So this is 128.

- [00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=2206) This is even looking better.

- [00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=2207) Okay.

- [00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=2208) But you see you don't get that natural look when you do inpainting.

- [00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=2214) I think most natural look comes from raw output but this is still decent.

- [00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=2219) So this is one way to improve.

- [00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=2221) What is the other way of improving.

- [00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=2223) By the way, this is a real improvement.

- [00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=2226) The second way of improvement is using ControlNet.

- [00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=2230) I have shown how to do this in another tutorial but I will also show here.

- [00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=2235) First click enable, click pixel perfect, select tile from here.

- [00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=2241) This doesn't produce always better results but you can also try this and see if it will

- [00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=2245) produce better for you.

- [00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=2247) Select tile color fix, select my prompt is more important.

- [00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=2251) This is the first ControlNet then select ControlNet unit one.

- [00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=2255) Enable pixel perfect.

- [00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=2257) Select inpaint from here and don't change anything.

- [00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=2262) This is important.

- [00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=2263) Select whole picture and select inpaint not masked okay and hit generate.

- [00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=2269) This will inpaint the entire image and it will likely to improve your face and also

- [00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=2276) clothing.

- [00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=2277) However, the best output is always from raw images.

- [00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=2281) This doesn't work.

- [00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=2282) Let's also increase the denoising strength to 1 and try again.

- [00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=2285) Okay, this is a little bit better, but still not good as the original inpainting.

- [00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=2292) Sometimes it produces better results, sometimes it is not producing better results.

- [00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=2296) So I have an example here.

- [00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=2298) The left one is the original, the right one is the raw output and here we are seeing the

- [00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=2304) ControlNet applied option.

- [00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=2307) I think it is subjective which one is looking better.

- [00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=2311) So it is up to you.

- [00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=2312) I have done a lot of testing and sometimes it is producing better, sometimes not so it

- [00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=2317) is up to you to test.

- [00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=2319) I think with this way it is adding more details like you are seeing here from here.

- [00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=2324) But still both of them are good.

- [00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=2327) So it is up to you to also apply this ControlNet trick.

- [00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=2331) So what is important here is as much as possibly getting a good base image.

- [00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=2338) Good raw output then inpainting face to fix.

- [00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=2341) This is also very high quality inpainting result.

- [00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=2344) Let me show you the settings one more time.

- [00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=2347) Inpaint masked, masked content original, only masked, only masked padding pixels 96, resize

- [00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=2356) is same, didn't change the resolution.

- [00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=2358) Denoising strength is 75 percent.

- [00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=2361) This is all the settings.

- [00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=2363) So this is the inpainted result.

- [00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=2365) Let's compare them.

- [00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=2366) This was the base image.

- [00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=2368) So from this base image to this inpainted result which is a very significant improvement.

- [00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=2374) It is also looking pretty natural.

- [00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=2376) Let's also compare it with the real image.

- [00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=2379) So here on the left we have the real image.

- [00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=2381) On the right we have the inpainted face.

- [00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=2384) However, we are able to get this quality because we are doing training on a realistic vision

- [00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=2390) model the most realistic model available right now.

- [00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=2394) We are using real class images and we are using very high resolution.

- [00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=2399) All these are affecting our results significantly.

- [00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=2403) So I will put the summary and everything explained in this video to this Patreon post.

- [00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=2409) You will be able to find everything on there.

- [00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=2413) Alternatively, you can watch the entire video again.

- [00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=2416) I am still going to work on even a better workflow for more realism.

- [00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=2422) I am going to work on styling workflow as well because with realism and styling you

- [00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=2429) can't get both of them at the same time.

- [00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=2432) You can get either good styling or you can get either good realism.

- [00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=2436) Moreover, I will work on a new, better, fine-tuned base model to train our images onto them to

- [00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=2444) obtain even better quality images.

- [00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=2447) Better output.

- [00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=2503) Hopefully see you in another amazing video.

- [00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0wXIcRhkJk&t=2506) By the way, I have written the used commit hashes in the very bottom of the readme file.
