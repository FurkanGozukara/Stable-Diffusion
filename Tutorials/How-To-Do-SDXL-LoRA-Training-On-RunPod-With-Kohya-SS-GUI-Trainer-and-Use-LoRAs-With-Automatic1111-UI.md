Hopefully I will do more research about SDXL training. Will investigate training only unet without text encoder. Moreover, I will investigate and make a workflow about celebrity name based training hopefully. Furthermore, SDXL full DreamBooth training is also on my research and workflow preparation list. Stay subscribed for all.

### Video Transcription


- [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=0) Greetings everyone.

- [00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1) In this video I will show you how you can use SDXL on RunPod services to Kohya SS LoRA

- [00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=9) training on SDXL even if you don't have any GPU.

- [00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=14) Because this is a cloud service, the tutorial works both on RunPod Stable Diffusion Web

- [00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=19) UI template and also RunPod Fast Stable Diffusion template.

- [00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=24) So I will show you step-by-step installation and training of Kohya GUI SS on RunPod.

- [00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=31) As you are seeing right now, I will show you the important steps, the tips and tricks.

- [00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=37) Moreover, I will show you how you can update Automatic1111 Web UI to the latest version

- [00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=44) and use best VAE and generate amazing pictures like this.

- [00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=48) I will show you the LoRA training logic of SDXL by using Kohya GUI Trainer on RunPod.

- [00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=55) Moreover, I will show you the extension of After Detailer (ADetailer) to automatically

- [00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=62) fix and improve faces of distant shots.

- [00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=65) With ADetailer, it has automatic face inpainting, but it also has automatic hand inpainting

- [00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=73) as well.

- [00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=74) So you can also test this, but I didn't find it very useful.

- [00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=77) So it is up to you to test.

- [00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=79) After watching this tutorial, you will be able to generate amazing quality images like

- [00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=84) this.

- [00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=85) And all of the training will be done by only using RTX 3090 Pod, which is a pretty cheap

- [00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=93) Pod, only 35 cents per hour.

- [00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=96) So I have prepared a very detailed GitHub readme file that I will share all of the links

- [00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=102) and instructions to follow this tutorial.

- [00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=105) Actually, this file was used in my latest RunPod Kohya tutorial.

- [00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=110) So I updated it.

- [00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=111) I will show both automatic installation and step-by-step manual installation.

- [00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=116) Let's go to our RunPod account from here.

- [00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=119) Let's login.

- [00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=120) I will start 2 machines and I will do both automatic and manual installation.

- [00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=126) You can choose either Stable Diffusion Web UI template or RunPod Fast Stable Diffusion

- [00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=133) template.

- [00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=134) Both of them are working.

- [00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=136) When you are watching this tutorial, you may see different versions.

- [00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=140) Don't worry.

- [00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=141) I will update the GitHub readme file if it be necessary.

- [00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=145) So let's begin with the Web UI version.

- [00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=148) Let's continue.

- [00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=149) Deploy.

- [00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=150) Okay.

- [00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=151) You see, we got an error.

- [00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=152) So we need to pick another Pod.

- [00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=154) Sometimes this happens.

- [00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=155) So I will select extreme speed.

- [00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=157) I am using RTX 3090 because it is pretty good.

- [00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=162) Also pretty cheap.

- [00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=163) I don't suggest you to use RTX 4090 at the moment because of the drivers.

- [00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=169) I think it is not working at the full performance.

- [00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=172) So let's go with RTX 3090.

- [00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=174) Okay.

- [00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=175) Template is selected.

- [00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=176) Let's deploy.

- [00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=177) Okay.

- [00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=178) Let's go to my Pods.

- [00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=179) Let's say this will be auto installation.

- [00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=182) Okay.

- [00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=183) Let's start another Pod quickly.

- [00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=185) I'm going to use same template.

- [00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=187) Let's go to my Pods.

- [00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=189) Installation is totally same for Web UI template and also Fast Stable Diffusion template.

- [00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=195) So this will be manual.

- [00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=197) Wait until you get connect button appearing here.

- [00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=201) After you got the connect button, click it.

- [00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=204) Connect the JupyterLab.

- [00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=205) So the JupyterLab is loaded.

- [00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=208) Let's begin with automatic installation.

- [00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=210) Open this post.

- [00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=212) Everything is also written here.

- [00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=214) It is so easy to use.

- [00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=216) We will download these three attachments.

- [00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=219) Let's download them.

- [00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=221) Then upload them into the workspace.

- [00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=223) Click this upload icon.

- [00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=225) Select them and upload as you are seeing right now.

- [00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=228) Then open a new terminal.

- [00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=229) Then you need to only execute these 2 commands.

- [00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=233) It will totally automatically install Kohya and download necessary models.

- [00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=239) So copy this.

- [00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=241) Paste it.

- [00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=242) Hit enter.

- [00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=243) It will start doing processing.

- [00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=244) Open another terminal like this.

- [00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=246) Copy this.

- [00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=247) Paste it and hit enter.

- [00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=248) And nothing else you need to do for automatic installation.

- [00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=252) Now we can begin manual installation.

- [00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=255) Running after automatic installation and manual installation are totally same.

- [00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=260) You just copy this and execute it for running.

- [00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=263) Before showing you manual installation, there are two important things: You should download

- [00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=268) your models and choose them.

- [00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=270) Also, if you don't know how to use Kohya, how to do Kohya LoRA training, please watch

- [00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=321) I have put the resources links here so you can quickly download the Realistic Vision

- [00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=327) model from here.

- [00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=329) Best VAE from here and SDXL best VAE from here.

- [00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=334) So let's do first manual installation and download the models.

- [00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=337) The manual installation is also pretty straightforward.

- [00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=342) You need to execute each one of the commands one by one.

- [00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=346) So let's begin from this.

- [00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=347) Copy it.

- [00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=348) Let's connect to our manual installation pod.

- [00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=350) Connect to JupyterLab.

- [00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=352) Meanwhile, automatic installation is doing everything for us.

- [00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=355) Let's open terminal.

- [00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=357) Paste the command.

- [00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=358) Hit enter.

- [00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=359) Make sure that command is completely run.

- [00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=362) Then select the second command.

- [00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=364) Paste it.

- [00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=365) Do not skip any of the commands.

- [00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=367) It is asking you to continue.

- [00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=369) Yes.

- [00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=370) Then copy this command.

- [00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=371) Paste it.

- [00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=372) Then copy this command.

- [00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=374) Paste it.

- [00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=375) Hit enter.

- [00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=376) It will clone the Kohya-SS repository.

- [00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=378) Then copy this command.

- [00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=380) Paste it.

- [00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=381) We will move into the Kohya-SS folder.

- [00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=384) Then copy this command.

- [00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=385) Paste it.

- [00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=386) Hit enter.

- [00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=387) Then we will activate the virtual environment.

- [00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=389) Copy this command.

- [00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=390) Paste it.

- [00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=391) Virtual environment is activated as you are seeing here.

- [00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=395) Then copy this command.

- [00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=398) Execute it.

- [00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=399) Then copy this command and this will do the final installation.

- [00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=403) Execute it.

- [00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=404) This will take a lot of time.

- [00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=406) Just patiently wait until it is completely finished and it won't display you the status

- [00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=412) of installing package.

- [00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=414) You need to wait until that package is installed and it will move to the next package.

- [00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=419) So this may take a lot of time depending on your selected RunPod.

- [00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=424) Okay both automatic and manual installations are completed.

- [00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=429) Since we are using SD Web UI template we need to kill automatically started Automatic1111

- [00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=436) Web UI instance.

- [00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=437) You see it is currently using 30% GPU.

- [00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=442) So we need to change the relauncher.py file.

- [00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=446) Changed relauncher.py file is shared on the Patreon post.

- [00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=450) Open it, download the relauncher.py file.

- [00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=454) Enter inside Stable Diffusion Web UI folder.

- [00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=457) Click upload icon.

- [00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=459) Upload relauncher.py file overwrite then restart your pod.

- [00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=464) So if you're not my Patreon subscriber.

- [00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=467) Enter inside Stable Diffusion Web UI folder.

- [00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=469) Double click relauncher.py file.

- [00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=471) Copy this line.

- [00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=474) Change the while line here like me.

- [00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=477) Save it.

- [00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=478) Don't forget to save the file, then restart the pod.

- [00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=481) That's it.

- [00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=482) So the automatic installer already downloaded Realistic Vision version 5.1 model.

- [00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=487) SD 1.5 best VAE file, and SDXL best VAE file.

- [00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=494) Let me show you them.

- [00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=495) When we enter inside Stable Diffusion Web UI, inside models, inside Stable Diffusion

- [00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=501) folder, we will see the Realistic Vision model here.

- [00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=504) Also, when we check out the VAE folder, we will see the base safetensors model here.

- [00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=512) SDXL base model and refiner model is included in the both Stable Diffusion Web UI template

- [00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=520) and Fast Stable Diffusion template, so you don't need to download them yourself.

- [00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=526) Now I will close my auto installation and continue with manual installation because

- [00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=531) the rest is almost same.

- [00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=534) So let's connect to manual installation.

- [00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=537) Let me show you how you can download these models into the respective folders.

- [00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=541) For example, let's download Realistic Vision version 5.1.

- [00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=545) Copy it.

- [00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=547) Enter inside models, inside Stable Diffusion.

- [00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=550) Open a new terminal here, paste and it should work.

- [00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=553) You see it has started downloading, then to download VAE, enter inside VAE folder, open

- [00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=560) a new terminal, copy the command, paste it and hit enter.

- [00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=565) So for training without using GPU memory, I will kill the automatically started Automatic1111

- [00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=572) Web UI instance.

- [00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=573) To kill it I will copy this, open a new terminal, paste it, and I will kill it.

- [00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=579) You will also get this message.

- [00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=580) It is not important.

- [00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=582) What is important?

- [00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=583) The important thing is you will see pid here which is process id.

- [00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=588) It is terminated.

- [00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=589) Also, when you check your my pods section, you should see GPU memory used 0%.

- [00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=596) So we will be fully able to utilize the memory of the GPU.

- [00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=600) Then open a new launcher, terminal and for starting the Kohya GUI, we will copy this

- [00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=606) command.

- [00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=607) This is same for both automatic and manual installation.

- [00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=610) After installation, paste it and hit enter and it will start Kohya GUI with a shared

- [00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=617) Gradio link.

- [00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=618) We will get the Gradio link here.

- [00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=620) Okay, let's open it and the Kohya GUI has started.

- [00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=625) You see LoRA, DreamBooth, all other tabs are here.

- [00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=628) What is different with RunPod training than doing it on your computer like in a Unix system

- [00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=635) or Windows.

- [00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=637) Only different thing is paths, nothing else.

- [00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=639) For example, if I want to save the configuration, I need to type it here like this and click

- [00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=645) save.

- [00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=646) Then when I check the workspace folder here I will see the test1.json file.

- [00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=653) Now I will show you an SDXL training with my training data set.

- [00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=658) To do that, I will use 2700 ground truth real person images for regularization.

- [00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=665) I have explained all of these in very much details in this tutorial.

- [00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=671) So watch this tutorial to learn how to do training.

- [00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=675) This tutorial currently that you are watching is all about how to replicate this tutorial

- [00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=681) on a RunPod machine like it is on your computer.

- [00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=686) So the instructions to download images on RunPod is shared here.

- [00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=690) Okay, I have downloaded and extracted all of the images.

- [00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=695) Let me show you some of them.

- [00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=697) For example, this one, it is getting opened or this one.

- [00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=701) These are super high quality ground truth regularization images.

- [00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=706) Or maybe let's open another one.

- [00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=708) This one okay here, another one as you are seeing.

- [00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=713) So now I will upload my training images.

- [00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=716) For uploading and downloading I suggest you to use runpodctl.

- [00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=721) I have explained how to use runpodctl in this tutorial, how to install it in this tutorial.

- [00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=728) The runpodctl is also shared in this Patreon post, click it.

- [00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=733) Then you can download this auto installer and it will install you automatically runpodctl.

- [00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=739) After installation when you type runpodctl like this, you should get this runpodctl message.

- [00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=748) Then it means it is ready.

- [00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=750) Now I will upload my training images by using runpodctl.

- [00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=754) All of them are 10,024 (1024) pixels by 10,024 (1024) pixels.

- [00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=759) I suggest you to use same dimension having images.

- [00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=763) I have explained it a lot of details in this tutorial.

- [00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=767) So how are we going to upload them?

- [00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=769) First, I will make a folder here named as train, then enter inside that folder, then

- [00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=776) I will move to parent folder, copy the path of the folder, open a new cmd, then type runpodctl

- [00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=785) send put a quotation mark like this, paste the folder path and add the quotation mark

- [00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=791) and hit enter and it will give you a link.

- [00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=794) Copy it.

- [00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=795) Why this is useful because if you had 1000 images, it would be much harder.

- [00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=799) So open a terminal here, paste the command and hit enter.

- [00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=804) Alternatively, you can use this upload icon, select all of your files from here, and upload

- [00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=811) them.

- [00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=812) This alternative way so you see all of the images are uploaded.

- [00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=816) Now I am totally ready to start training.

- [00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=820) The training is completely same as I have shown and explained in this tutorial video.

- [00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=826) The only thing that changes are the paths.

- [00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=829) So let's begin with selecting our base model.

- [00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=833) Select custom here.

- [00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=834) Let's go inside where our model is located.

- [00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=838) Inside here.

- [00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=839) Let's copy the path.

- [00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=840) Right click, copy path, then paste it here like this.

- [00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=845) Don't forget to put this backslash to the beginning.

- [00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=847) People are making this mistake.

- [00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=850) Select SDXL model, save.

- [00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=853) Then go to the tools.

- [00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=854) Go to the deprecated tab.

- [00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=857) In here set your parameters.

- [00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=859) Let's get the path of our training images which are here.

- [00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=863) Let's copy the path.

- [00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=864) So here I copy the path.

- [00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=866) I will make the repeating 25.

- [00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=868) I will copy the path of the regularization images.

- [00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=871) They are also called as classification images as well.

- [00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=874) Repeating 1.

- [00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=875) The destination.

- [00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=877) Now this is important.

- [00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=878) I will make the destination inside LoRA folder of Automatic1111 Web UI so I will be able

- [00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=884) to use them directly.

- [00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=886) So I copy path.

- [00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=887) Always I am putting backslash to the beginning of the path just here.

- [00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=891) Click prepare training data.

- [00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=893) Then in here you will see the message of the folders are generated.

- [00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=898) Then click copy info to folders tab.

- [00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=901) Go back to training, go back to folders and you will see the folders are set like this.

- [00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=908) Give a name.

- [00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=909) Let's say runpod_kohya.

- [00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=911) We are still not ready yet.

- [00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=912) Click save.

- [00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=913) Go to the parameters.

- [00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=915) These are the parameters that I am using currently.

- [00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=917) There could be better parameters.

- [00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=919) I am in research.

- [00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=920) So number of epochs are 8.

- [00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=923) bf16, bf16, cache latents and cache latents to disk.

- [00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=927) Learning rate is like this 4e-4.

- [00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=930) Constant learning rate.

- [00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=932) Scheduler optimizer will be Adafactor.

- [00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=935) I won't use bucketing because I have all same dimension images.

- [00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=940) Max resolution.

- [00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=941) Don't forget to change this as well.

- [00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=943) I am making the learning rate equal in text encoder learning rate and UNET learning rate.

- [00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=949) Hopefully I will also research training only UNET not training text encoder and make another

- [00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=955) video about that.

- [00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=956) So stay subscribed.

- [00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=958) Network Rank (Dimension).

- [00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=959) This is really important.

- [00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=961) Network Rank (Dimension) has a certain effect.

- [00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=964) When you open this tweet that I have shared, you will get to this page.

- [00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=969) And when I use Network Rank (Dimension) higher such as 256.

- [00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=975) It is able to learn more details about the subject that we are training.

- [00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=980) However, what is happening?

- [00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=982) The extra network layers that is being used during the inference is overriding the existing

- [00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=990) knowledge of the model.

- [00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=992) So the subject we trained becomes better.

- [00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=994) However, when you look at these trees, you see they are not looking good.

- [00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1000) This is 256.

- [00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1001) When we compare the same prompt with the Network Rank (Dimension) 32, we see the tree details

- [00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1008) are much better.

- [00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1010) They are looking much better.

- [00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1011) So there is a trade-off between higher Network Rank (Dimension) and lower Network Rank (Dimension).

- [00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1016) If you use higher Network Rank (Dimension), you will learn more details about the subject

- [00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1021) that you are training.

- [00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1022) It can be style, it can be person.

- [00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1024) It can be whatever you are training.

- [00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1026) However, the model will lose its existing knowledge.

- [00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1031) So for this training I will use 32.

- [00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1033) You can also use 256.

- [00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1035) You can use 128.

- [00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1037) It is totally up to you.

- [00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1039) You can try different Network Rank (Dimensions) and compare the results according to your

- [00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1043) purpose.

- [00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1044) So let's go with 32 network.

- [00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1046) Alpha 1.

- [00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1047) The advanced tab is now located here, so in the advanced tab we just need to select Gradient

- [00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1053) Checkpointing and that's it.

- [00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1056) You don't need to change anything else.

- [00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1058) Save.

- [00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1059) Before starting training.

- [00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1061) Click print training command and check out the command from this.

- [00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1065) Open the terminal window, verify that everything is looking good.

- [00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1069) The number of images found, number of steps.

- [00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1071) I explain everything in very much details in this tutorial video.

- [00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1076) So don't forget to watch it.

- [00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1078) For SD 1.5 watch this tutorial.

- [00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1081) Everything is same with SD 1.5.

- [00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1083) You are giving the parameters, models, pathing, everything, just the learning rate and use

- [00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1089) used optimization may change.

- [00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1091) I haven't recently tested for SD 1.5 models.

- [00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1095) So for learning, RunPod again this is the best tutorial.

- [00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1098) Okay, we are ready to start training, so just click, start training and watch the terminal

- [00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1104) where you have started your Kohya GUI instance.

- [00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1107) It will show you everything like you are seeing right now.

- [00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1111) I am not using captions at the moment, but I will also hopefully make a research about

- [00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1116) using captions for training a subject.

- [00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1119) Possibly also for teaching a style and make tutorial videos about them as well.

- [00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1124) So stay tuned for that too.

- [00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1126) So it is now caching our images.

- [00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1128) The caching images is only 1 time.

- [00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1130) So the training has been started and it has been over 16 minutes.

- [00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1134) The training speed is 1.39 seconds per it, which is pretty decent when you consider we

- [00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1142) are just using RTX 3090 a very cheap GPU.

- [00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1148) So this is the speed and hopefully it will be completed in one 1 hour 44 minutes.

- [00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1154) So it is going to take about 2 hours for 5200 steps with batch size 1.

- [00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1161) So the training has been completed.

- [00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1163) It took exactly 2 hours for 5200 steps.

- [00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1167) Now we will begin using our trained LoRA models and how are we going to do that?

- [00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1174) We are going to start our Stable Diffusion Automatic1111 Web UI instance on RunPod.

- [00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1180) Before starting your instance I suggest you to update it to the latest version.

- [00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1185) I have an auto updater script on my Patreon post.

- [00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1189) Let's update both automatically and manually.

- [00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1192) I am keeping this file up-to-date.

- [00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1195) Let's download the 1 click auto1111 SDXL file, upload it into our workspace folder, open

- [00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1203) a new terminal.

- [00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1204) By the way how did I understand my Kohya training completed?

- [00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1208) You are looking at the terminal where you have started your Kohya.

- [00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1212) Don't forget that.

- [00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1213) All right.

- [00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1214) We have uploaded our updater file.

- [00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1216) Then we will execute this command to run this auto updater file.

- [00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1221) It is going to update Automatic1111 Web UI to the latest version.

- [00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1225) It will install xFormers, enable it and it will download the best VAE file.

- [00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1231) So how could you update it yourself?

- [00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1234) It is following by these commands that you are seeing.

- [00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1238) This is the auto updater file right now.

- [00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1241) It may change in the future, but this is the way updating.

- [00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1245) You do git stash, do git checkout master, git pull so it is updating to the latest version.

- [00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1250) However, there is 1 tricky issue.

- [00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1252) When you do git stash and git checkout to the master and do git pull it will overwrite

- [00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1259) the web user pt1(.sh) file the file that we use on RunPod.

- [00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1265) So before updating it, enter inside Stable Diffusion Web UI folder and take a backup

- [00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1272) of your webui-user.sh file.

- [00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1276) You see currently it is already overwritten by the updater.

- [00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1279) Then it will get replaced again after the update.

- [00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1282) So make sure that you have downloaded this file onto your computer, then upload it again

- [00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1288) after the updating.

- [00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1289) This is crucial.

- [00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1290) Then another crucial thing is you need to activate the virtual environment of the Automatic1111

- [00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1297) Web UI, then install xFormers like this.

- [00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1300) After that the rest is so easy.

- [00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1302) You see we are downloading the best VAE file and in this line it is actually reverting

- [00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1308) back the webui-user.sh file.

- [00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1310) So the update has been completed and also Automatic1111 Web UI instance has been started.

- [00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1318) You can also manually start your Web UI instance by using this command that is shared on the

- [00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1323) GitHub readme file because before training we have terminated the running instance of

- [00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1329) Automatic1111 Web UI to free up the used vram.

- [00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1333) So where the LoRA files are saved?

- [00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1336) Because we have saved them inside models folder, inside LoRA folder during our training, our

- [00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1343) LoRA files are already in the LoRA folder of Automatic1111 Web UI.

- [00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1347) Therefore, the Automatic1111 Web UI will see all of the LoRA files automatically.

- [00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1352) Moreover, I rename the latest epoch, the latest checkpoint with the same naming convention

- [00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1360) of the other previous checkpoints.

- [00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1362) So let's rename this as the checkpoint 8 like this.

- [00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1366) Okay, let's connect to our Web UI instance, connect, connect to http port and we will

- [00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1373) connect the Automatic1111 Web UI instance.

- [00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1375) Okay, it is loading the model.

- [00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1377) You see it has started the other model that we downloaded.

- [00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1380) Now, we will switch to the base model because we did the training on base model.

- [00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1385) So whichever the model you use for your training, it will work best with your LoRAs.

- [00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1390) SDXL LoRAs are not compatible with SD 1.5 version LoRAs and let's also set our best

- [00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1397) VAE file.

- [00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1399) To do that, let's go to user interface.

- [00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1401) Let's type SD VAE to the quick selection, quick settings list, then apply settings and

- [00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1408) reload UI.

- [00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1409) There is one another important thing with SDXL actually.

- [00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1413) So it is better to also add.

- [00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1415) Let's refresh this file.

- [00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1419) Okay, --no-half-vae.

- [00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1421) This is necessary for SDXL.

- [00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1423) Automatic1111 is doing this automatically.

- [00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1426) However, if you also put this command, it is useful.

- [00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1429) Because in some cases, Automatic1111 Web UI is failing to enable 32 bit full VAE precision.

- [00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1438) So therefore, if you manually add this, it is better.

- [00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1440) All right.

- [00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1441) I will also update my auto updater for this change so it will automatically add that in

- [00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1447) future downloads.

- [00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1448) Let's also select the SD VAE safetensors from here and we are ready to start generating

- [00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1457) our images.

- [00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1458) So click the Stable Diffusion link here on the GitHub readme file.

- [00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1462) This is my main repository.

- [00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1464) We have reached 700 stars.

- [00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1467) I hope you also Star the repository.

- [00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1469) Fork it.

- [00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1470) Also Watch it.

- [00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1471) If you also be sponsor of me I would appreciate that very much.

- [00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1474) All of these are helping me.

- [00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1476) In here I have amazing prompts list for Stable Diffusion so I will use some of the prompts

- [00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1483) from here.

- [00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1484) For example, let's try this prompt.

- [00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1486) Okay, this is the positive prompt.

- [00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1489) Let's copy paste it.

- [00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1490) Then there is negative prompt here.

- [00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1492) So let's also copy paste it and let's apply some high resolution fix like 1.2 like 20%.

- [00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1501) Let's make the denoising 50%.

- [00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1503) Let's make the CFG 9.

- [00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1505) And one more thing.

- [00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1506) You need to also append your trained LoRA.

- [00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1509) So where is the LoRA?

- [00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1511) LoRA is currently from this icon.

- [00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1513) But when the development branch of Automatic1111 Web UI merged into main branch, this icon

- [00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1519) is gone.

- [00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1520) And the LoRA tab will be here.

- [00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1522) So don't get confused.

- [00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1524) So these are our LoRA files.

- [00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1525) For example let's append the seventh one.

- [00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1528) This is usually the best one with these settings.

- [00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1530) Okay, let's close it and let's generate.

- [00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1533) The generation is happening.

- [00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1535) It is 2.25 it per second right now.

- [00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1538) It is doing the high resolution fix.

- [00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1540) Okay.

- [00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1541) Image is generated.

- [00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1543) However, the face is not very good because it's a distant shot.

- [00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1546) So how can I fix the face.

- [00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1548) For that I will use an extension called as Adetailer.

- [00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1553) So let's load from here, search for detailer, then you will go to the after detailer extension.

- [00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1560) Install it.

- [00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1561) I don't know if this extension is requiring any new library installation because if it

- [00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1567) is requiring something new to be installed, you need to remove --skip-install from here.

- [00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1572) This is added by default.

- [00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1574) Currently, since I did the auto upgrade, it is removed, so don't forget to remove that.

- [00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1580) Okay, after extension has been installed, let's restart the Web UI and we can watch

- [00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1586) what is happening from our terminal where we have started our Web UI.

- [00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1592) Okay, it is restarting.

- [00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1593) It is downloading the necessary face detection models.

- [00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1596) It has downloaded and the Web UI started.

- [00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1599) Okay, it is still reloading.

- [00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1601) Okay, reload almost completed and reload completed.

- [00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1605) Let's click this to reload the last values.

- [00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1609) It has reloaded the seed as well.

- [00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1611) Now I will use adetailer.

- [00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1612) You see, I have the adetailer extension here.

- [00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1615) I just need to enable it and if I leave this prompt input blank, it will use the inputs

- [00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1623) from here.

- [00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1624) So let's generate and see the difference.

- [00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1626) The generated images will be in the outputs folder in the text 2 image tab.

- [00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1630) You see you can download all of them either one by one or using runpodctl which is the

- [00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1635) best way.

- [00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1636) So you can start a new terminal here, type runpodctl send, copy the folder path name

- [00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1643) like this and it will give you a link to download all of the images inside that folder.

- [00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1649) Okay, it is generating first, then it is going to inpaint the face.

- [00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1653) Okay, for some reason this image didn't work well.

- [00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1657) This is interesting.

- [00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1659) Let's manually inpaint so I send it to the inpaint.

- [00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1662) Okay, image has come.

- [00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1663) So let's mark the face and let's inpaint only masked.

- [00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1669) All right?

- [00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1670) Yeah, looking good.

- [00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1671) Let's make the denoising strength 50% and try again.

- [00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1674) Okay, it is somewhat similar to it but not much.

- [00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1677) So I will just try photo of ohwx man and the LoRA.

- [00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1682) I want to see the difference.

- [00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1684) Okay now I see the face similarity.

- [00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1687) Yes it is now much better.

- [00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1689) Similar to me since it is too distant.

- [00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1692) It is not very visible but it is exactly like me.

- [00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1696) So let's change the prompt.

- [00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1697) Or maybe let's try some another one with another seed.

- [00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1702) I will generate 12 images and then we can look all of them.

- [00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1707) By the way, this is running on cloud, therefore you don't need a GPU.

- [00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1710) You probably already know that, but I am just reminding it.

- [00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1715) Okay, this image has 2 faces so just let's skip it.

- [00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1719) Even though I did skip it is also inpainting face so I will also skip that part.

- [00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1723) Okay, now move to next image.

- [00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1725) I just noticed a mistake of me.

- [00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1728) I should make the inpaint width and height 1024 because we did the training with that.

- [00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1735) I will also increase the inpaint denoising strength so let's make them like this.

- [00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1741) All right.

- [00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1742) Oh by the way, I don't need to because if you only choose use separate width and height

- [00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1747) you need to set this.

- [00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1748) So this wasn't a mistake.

- [00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1750) So I am just going to increase the inpaint denoising strength to 50%.

- [00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1755) Okay, the generations are completed.

- [00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1757) However, the face is not matching very well.

- [00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1761) The quality is very good, but the faces are not very good.

- [00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1765) So let's try another prompt which I like to test the face quality.

- [00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1772) It is somewhere around here, so it is here.

- [00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1775) I prefer this quality to test the face.

- [00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1778) All right here.

- [00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1780) And let's also copy the negative prompt and then we can re-evaluate better.

- [00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1784) Oh by the way, I will close the high resolution fix.

- [00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1787) Maybe that is the reason.

- [00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1789) So let's just try first without high resolution fix.

- [00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1793) Okay.

- [00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1794) Okay we got the results.

- [00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1795) They are pretty decent.

- [00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1797) Let's look at them.

- [00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1798) These are not cherry picked results.

- [00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1800) They are looking very decent.

- [00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1801) We also applied the adetailer.

- [00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1804) You are seeing right now.

- [00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1805) Really really good details.

- [00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1807) Looking decent.

- [00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1808) So what we need to do is we probably need to change the prompt of the after detailer

- [00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1815) in our last prompt.

- [00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1817) Okay, I made some changes and look again.

- [00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1820) Yes, now we can see the face very clearly.

- [00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1823) The face.

- [00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1824) Of course, without generating a lot of images, you won't get the best results so you need

- [00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1830) to generate a lot.

- [00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1831) Okay, this is a very good one.

- [00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1833) Okay, okay this is also looking pretty good.

- [00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1836) The face is there.

- [00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1837) These are not cherry picks.

- [00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1838) This is the first results.

- [00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1840) So as you generate more you will get much better results.

- [00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1843) Okay, this is also really good.

- [00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1845) Yeah, this is also really good one.

- [00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1847) Yeah, the model is working, everything is working.

- [00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1850) You see.

- [00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1851) Pretty good and you need to do some testing of course.

- [00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1854) So what I did extra: I added sunglasses to the negative because it was producing all

- [00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1859) sunglasses.

- [00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1860) Why?

- [00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1862) Because we used sunny day in the prompts.

- [00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1864) That is why.

- [00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1866) I normally have eyeglasses.

- [00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1868) Therefore it is associated me with eyeglasses.

- [00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1870) However, when sunny day added it is associating it with sunglasses instead of eyeglasses and

- [00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1877) in the after detailer (adetailer), I simplified the prompt as photo of ohwx man.

- [00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1885) Actually, I just typed photo ohwx man.

- [00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1888) So you need to try and see which one is doing the best for you.

- [00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1893) This is how you use RunPod for LoRA training how to use your trained LoRAs.

- [00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1900) So if something gets changed I will update this file.

- [00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1903) This file will be always up-to-date to install Kohya SS GUI on RunPod.

- [00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1910) So this is your source to see the installation commands instructions to install it.

- [00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1917) These instructions are working for both Web UI template and both Fast Stable Diffusion

- [00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1924) template.

- [00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEwaQ54DI4&t=1925) I hope you have enjoyed.
