Published by NVIDIA Labs SANA model just got a huge upgrade. 4K model is able to generate 16 Megapixels images natively without any upscale. Moreover, with Diffusers pipeline implementation and huge VRAM optimizations, now you can use this mind blowing resolution in GPUs as low as 8 GB VRAM having GPUs.

### Video Transcription


- [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjENQfHF4W8&t=0) Greetings everyone. This is an update video to&nbsp; our previous NVIDIA Labs SANA tutorial video.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjENQfHF4W8&t=8) Recently, there have been huge developments,&nbsp; and I have applied all these developments&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjENQfHF4W8&t=14) to our meticulously crafted application. Now we support VAE tiling, VAE slicing, model&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjENQfHF4W8&t=23) CPU offload, and enable sequential CPU offload. When you enable all these VRAM optimizations,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjENQfHF4W8&t=31) it is working with very low amount of VRAM.&nbsp; How low? When you read the announcements on&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjENQfHF4W8&t=37) our Patreon post, you will see that&nbsp; now as low as 4 GB GPUs can use the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjENQfHF4W8&t=44) NVIDIA SANA Labs model. This is just amazing. If you want to use 2K model, which is 2048 to&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjENQfHF4W8&t=52) 2048, only 6 GB GPUs, and now there is&nbsp; a newer model, which is SANA 4K.

- [00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjENQfHF4W8&t=60) This model is 16 megapixels, as you are seeing,&nbsp; 4096 to 4096, and it is usable as low as 8 GB&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjENQfHF4W8&t=71) GPUs, so that if your GPU is not high VRAM&nbsp; with these optimizations, with a great speed,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjENQfHF4W8&t=78) you can generate very high resolution images&nbsp; with SANA model. NVIDIA Labs is not abandoning&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjENQfHF4W8&t=85) this project. The developer is extremely&nbsp; active, and he keeps responding requests,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjENQfHF4W8&t=91) issues, adding new features. So, this project is&nbsp; promising for future. Therefore, I am keeping my&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjENQfHF4W8&t=98) application up to date, and I am adding all the&nbsp; newest features for you. So, this is an update&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjENQfHF4W8&t=105) video. If you don't know how to use SANA model,&nbsp; please watch the video, which is here. The link&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjENQfHF4W8&t=112) of this post will be in the description of the&nbsp; video, and also in our channel, the video is here.&nbsp;

- [00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjENQfHF4W8&t=118) To use the latest version, you need to make a&nbsp; fresh installation because the models have been&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjENQfHF4W8&t=123) changed. When you are starting with Windows&nbsp; start.bat file, you will see that there is&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjENQfHF4W8&t=128) a this option, HF_HUB_ENABLE_HF_TRANSFER. This option speeds up the downloading model&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjENQfHF4W8&t=137) significantly. However, in some computers, it&nbsp; is causing errors. So, if your download fails,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjENQfHF4W8&t=144) remove this and then start that way, so that&nbsp; your download will be working. The models will&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjENQfHF4W8&t=152) be downloaded into your Hugging Face cache folder,&nbsp; and the Hugging Face cache folder is inside users,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjENQfHF4W8&t=158) inside your username, inside cache,&nbsp; inside Hugging Face, and inside hub.&nbsp;

- [00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjENQfHF4W8&t=165) You will see all the Hugging Face cached&nbsp; models here. You can see that models,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjENQfHF4W8&t=171) efficient large models, SANA 1600M 2KPX.&nbsp; So, these are the SANA models that have been&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjENQfHF4W8&t=179) downloaded into my cache folder. And if you&nbsp; want to change your Hugging Face cache folder,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjENQfHF4W8&t=184) it is totally possible. How to change it? You&nbsp; will see a link here. When you open that post,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjENQfHF4W8&t=190) you will see all the necessary instructions to&nbsp; change your Hugging Face cache folder, so that&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjENQfHF4W8&t=195) the models will be downloaded into your desired&nbsp; hard drive if your C drive is out of space. And&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjENQfHF4W8&t=202) finally, I have generated some images. Now, I will&nbsp; show you them. Before starting to show you them,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjENQfHF4W8&t=208) I recommend you to join our Discord channel. You&nbsp; can type "SECourses Discord" and join our server.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjENQfHF4W8&t=214) This is a public server with over 9,500 members.&nbsp; I am replying everyone. You can go to our Patreon&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjENQfHF4W8&t=229) getting here. This is on GitHub repository,&nbsp; so it is public. You can see it. Moreover,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjENQfHF4W8&t=234) we have a Stable Diffusion Generative&nbsp; AI GitHub. So, please Star it, Fork it,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjENQfHF4W8&t=240) and Watch it. If you sponsor, I appreciate&nbsp; that. You will see all of our tutorials with&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjENQfHF4W8&t=245) a historical order. You see, it is starting&nbsp; from 1 to, when we go to the very bottom,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjENQfHF4W8&t=251) 96, and I am adding more tutorials and resources&nbsp; here as I record them. And we have a Reddit here.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjENQfHF4W8&t=257) When you go to here, you will see the Reddit,&nbsp; and you can join our Reddit. Watch it. This is&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjENQfHF4W8&t=262) also public. I am sharing a lot of information&nbsp; here, and hopefully, I am going to make a full&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjENQfHF4W8&t=268) tutorial and workflow for Hunyuan text&nbsp; to video model, Lora training. I am following&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjENQfHF4W8&t=273) Kohya. He is about to add block swapping. Once&nbsp; it is added, I am going to start research. I&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjENQfHF4W8&t=280) expect that the training will work as low as 8&nbsp; GB GPUs, and it will be hopefully amazing. So,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjENQfHF4W8&t=286) let's see some of the examples of SANA 4K model,&nbsp; and each image is 5,376 to 3,072. Let's begin.
