Given only a few-minute-long video of a person speaking with the audio track as the training data and arbitrary texts as the driving input, the authors aim to synthesize high-quality talking portrait videos corresponding to the input text. This task has broad application prospects in the digital human industry but has not been technically achieved yet due to two challenges: (1) It is challenging to mimic the timbre from out-of-domain audio for a traditional multi-speaker Text-to-Speech system. (2) It is hard to render high-fidelity and lip-synchronized talking avatars with limited training data. In this paper, the authors introduce Adaptive Text-to-Talking Avatar (Ada-TTA), which (1) designs a generic zero-shot multi-speaker TTS model that effectively disentangles the text content, timbre, and prosody; and (2) embraces recent advances in neural rendering to achieve realistic audio-driven talking face video generation. With these designs, the authors' method overcomes the aforementioned two challenges and successfully generates identity-preserving speech and realistic talking person videos. Experiments demonstrate that the authors' method can synthesize realistic, identity-preserving, and audio-visual synchronized talking avatar videos.

Ada-TTA: Towards Adaptive High-Quality Text-to-Talking Avatar Synthesis

Technology and AI enthusiasts have been intrigued in recent times by the rise of generative artificial intelligence across different sectors. For example, Adamopoulou (2020) highlighted the use of large language models (LLM) like chatbots that can produce high-quality, natural, and realistic dialogues. The advancement in text-to-speech (TTS) systems has enabled the synthesis of personalized speech using reference audio and plain texts.

In addition, strides in neural rendering techniques have given us the ability to generate realistic and high-fidelity talking face videos, often called Talking Face Generation (TFG). With a few training samples, researchers have accomplished significant progress. Combining these advancements in TTS and TFG models opens up possibilities for creating talking videos from text inputs alone. This combined system presents tremendous potential in applications like news broadcasting, virtual lectures, and talking chatbots, particularly given the recent progress of ChatGPT.

However, earlier TTS and TFG models required a significant volume of identity-specific data to produce satisfactory personalized results, which proved to be challenging in real-world scenarios where only a few minutes of target person video is typically available. Inspired by this limitation, researchers have been exploring a new area of study - low-resource text-to-talking avatar (TTA), which aims to create identity-preserving, audio-lip synchronized talking portrait videos with minimal input data.

Given the challenges associated with TTS and TFG, the foremost concern in TTS is how to effectively preserve the timbre identity of the input audio. While solutions have been proposed to these challenges, none have been fully satisfactory, suffering from issues like information loss, unsatisfactory identity preservation, and poor lip synchronization.

To overcome these hurdles, researchers have introduced Ada-TTA, a joint system of TTS and TFG that employs the latest advancements in each domain. To enhance the identity-preserving capability of the TTS model, they have devised a unique zero-shot multi-speaker TTS model that leverages a massive 20,000-hour-long TTS dataset. It can synthesize high-quality personalized speech from a single short recording of an unseen speaker.

For high-fidelity and lip-synchronized talking face generation, the GeneFace++ system is integrated into Ada-TTA. This TFG system boosts lip-synchronization and system efficiency while maintaining high fidelity. With the combination of these innovative systems, Ada-TTA is able to produce high-quality text-to-talking avatar synthesis, even with limited resources.

Tests of Ada-TTA have demonstrated positive outcomes in the synthesis of speech and video. Ada-TTA not only holds up well under both objective and subjective metrics but also outperforms baseline measurements. This novel approach marks a promising step towards more realistic and accessible talking avatars.
