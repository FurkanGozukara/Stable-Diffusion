Wan 2.1 and CausVid with CausVid LoRA

In the rapidly evolving field of video generation, two models have made significant strides: Wan 2.1 and CausVid. Wan 2.1, developed by Alibaba Group, is a large-scale video generative model that sets new benchmarks in quality and diversity. CausVid, designed for fast and interactive causal video generation, introduces an autoregressive approach to overcome the limitations of traditional models. A key innovation is the CausVid LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation), which reduces the computational steps required for video generation with Wan 2.1 from 50 to just 8, while maintaining exceptional quality.

CausVid: Speed and Interactivity

CausVid adapts a pretrained bidirectional diffusion transformer into an autoregressive transformer, generating frames sequentially. This reduces initial latency to 1.3 seconds and enables continuous frame generation at 9.4 FPS. Using Distribution Matching Distillation (DMD), CausVid distills a 50-step diffusion

- [00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rAwZv0hEcU&t=161) because it was requested. All you need to do&nbsp; is just download Wan 2.1 core models bundle.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rAwZv0hEcU&t=167) This will download the new model file, which is&nbsp; the new LoRA file. You can see that it is here:&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rAwZv0hEcU&t=173) Wan 2.1 CausVid with text to video image to video&nbsp; LoRA version 2. You can follow the logs here,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rAwZv0hEcU&t=179) what is happening. It will just download the&nbsp; new file and skip the existing ones. You can&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rAwZv0hEcU&t=184) also follow the speed on the CMD window. You&nbsp; can see that it is super fast because we are&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rAwZv0hEcU&t=190) using all of the optimizations. Moreover,&nbsp; we support custom model download folders,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rAwZv0hEcU&t=196) so you can give any model folder, you can give&nbsp; ComfyUI, or wherever you are using. For ComfyUI,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rAwZv0hEcU&t=201) you can check this checkbox. If you get errors,&nbsp; you can just start again and resume. This is the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rAwZv0hEcU&t=207) ultimate model downloader. It supports so&nbsp; many models. You can just type name here,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rAwZv0hEcU&t=212) like Flux, and it will list you all of the Flux&nbsp; models. You see Flux bundles we have. Moreover,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rAwZv0hEcU&t=217) we have image generation models, Flux models, so&nbsp; it is listing you all of the models like this.

- [00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rAwZv0hEcU&t=222) Okay, you see all the models have been downloaded.&nbsp; We can see the queue size is zero. There is no&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rAwZv0hEcU&t=227) errors. Now, what we need to do is, we need to&nbsp; update our SwarmUI. As I said, if you didn't&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rAwZv0hEcU&t=233) follow the previous videos, follow them. So&nbsp; I will use Windows update SwarmUI.bat file,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rAwZv0hEcU&t=238) more info, run anyway. It will update it to the&nbsp; latest version and it will automatically start.

- [00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rAwZv0hEcU&t=243) So, how we are going to use this LoRA? I have&nbsp; prepared presets for you. So, click import&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rAwZv0hEcU&t=249) presets, choose file, go back to the installation&nbsp; folder and you will see amazing SwarmUI presets.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rAwZv0hEcU&t=256) Click overwrite and import, and it will import the&nbsp; presets. It will not overwrite your existing or&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rAwZv0hEcU&t=263) previous presets. Then, you will see that here in&nbsp; the quick tools, there is reset params to default.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rAwZv0hEcU&t=270) I recommend that, and it will set everything to&nbsp; the default. Then select this fast CausVid with&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rAwZv0hEcU&t=275) Wan 2.1. Click this icon and direct apply, and it&nbsp; will apply everything directly like this. Then I&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rAwZv0hEcU&t=282) will show image to video because it is most widely&nbsp; used, but you can also do the text to video,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rAwZv0hEcU&t=288) totally same. So, choose file. Let's choose&nbsp; our file like this. Then click this res and use&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rAwZv0hEcU&t=295) closest aspect ratio. It will set the aspect ratio&nbsp; according to the model you selected. Currently,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rAwZv0hEcU&t=301) it is selected Wan 2.1, this 720p model. You&nbsp; can use any model. There are a lot of variants&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rAwZv0hEcU&t=309) of the Wan 2.1 like Q6, Q5. We support all of&nbsp; them. Let me show you one more time. When I type&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rAwZv0hEcU&t=315) here Wan 2.1, and when I go to video generation&nbsp; models, Wan 2.1, you can see that we support FP16,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rAwZv0hEcU&t=322) FP8. You can see the description is here. So you&nbsp; can download any one of them. After that, set init&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rAwZv0hEcU&t=328) image creativity zero. This is super important.&nbsp; Then type your prompt like a talking children,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rAwZv0hEcU&t=334) whatever you want. Then you can change the number&nbsp; of frames you want. This will impact the length&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rAwZv0hEcU&t=339) of the video. Currently, it is by default set to&nbsp; 49 frames, so it will generate 3 seconds video,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rAwZv0hEcU&t=346) and you can make the FPS double with&nbsp; RIFE like this. Then click generate.

- [00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rAwZv0hEcU&t=351) There is one more important thing that I need&nbsp; to tell you. As I have shown in my previous&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rAwZv0hEcU&t=356) tutorials, you should follow your GPU watt usage.&nbsp; What does this mean? Let me open a new terminal,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rAwZv0hEcU&t=363) type pip install nvitop, then type nvitop and&nbsp; follow how much watt your GPU is using. It should&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rAwZv0hEcU&t=372) be close to the maximum. If it is not close to the&nbsp; maximum, that means that it is using shared VRAM.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rAwZv0hEcU&t=378) We don't want that. Since we are using ComfyUI&nbsp; as a backend, by default, it is supporting&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rAwZv0hEcU&t=383) block swapping. Therefore, it should be extremely&nbsp; optimized. You see, currently I'm using over 5W of&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rAwZv0hEcU&t=390) the 575 maximum. So it is working perfectly fine.&nbsp; And there is one trick, if it is not working like&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rAwZv0hEcU&t=397) this, even after you did restart your computer,&nbsp; go to the backends in the server tab and add this:&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rAwZv0hEcU&t=403) reverse VRAM. So, this will tell application&nbsp; to reverse 3 GB of VRAM memory all the time,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rAwZv0hEcU&t=410) and this fixed my issue. Sometimes you don't need&nbsp; this, but sometimes you need this. Unfortunately,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rAwZv0hEcU&t=417) I couldn't pinpoint the error reason. So if&nbsp; it is using shared VRAM, then set this. Don't&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rAwZv0hEcU&t=422) forget. And it will generate our video with&nbsp; most optimized way. You can go to the logs,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rAwZv0hEcU&t=427) click here debug, and you can see the step speed.&nbsp; Even though I am recording a video right now,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rAwZv0hEcU&t=431) it is generating with this speed with a&nbsp; HD resolution. You can see the resolution&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rAwZv0hEcU&t=436) is here: 784 by 1136. So this is a really HD&nbsp; resolution, and we should have it in a moment.

- [00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rAwZv0hEcU&t=445) And our video has been generated as you are&nbsp; seeing right now, with maximum quality in a&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rAwZv0hEcU&t=450) very short time. This video took only 2.3 minutes,&nbsp; and this is excellent quality. So let's also see&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rAwZv0hEcU&t=458) the how it performs on text to video model.&nbsp; To do that, I will click quick tools here,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rAwZv0hEcU&t=463) reset params to default again. Then I will&nbsp; change my model. I will change my model to&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rAwZv0hEcU&t=469) text to video. So let's type text here. Let's&nbsp; select text to video GGUF Q8. Then go to presets&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rAwZv0hEcU&t=476) and we need to apply our fast CausVid with Wan&nbsp; 2.1 text to video direct apply. It is applied,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rAwZv0hEcU&t=482) as you can see. Just type our prompt. This is a&nbsp; prompt that I have taken from here. I don't know&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rAwZv0hEcU&t=487) how it will work, so let's hit generate&nbsp; and let's see what we will get. You see,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rAwZv0hEcU&t=492) since I did click reset params to default,&nbsp; it disabled everything else and it did set&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rAwZv0hEcU&t=497) everything according to the preset&nbsp; accurately. This is super important.

- [00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rAwZv0hEcU&t=501) With fast CausVid with LoRA, we are not&nbsp; using Tea-cache because we are already doing&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rAwZv0hEcU&t=507) only 8 steps instead of 50 steps, but&nbsp; we can always use the Sage Attention,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rAwZv0hEcU&t=513) which I am using, and it is automatically&nbsp; installed with my installer, as I have shown&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rAwZv0hEcU&t=518) in my previous videos. Sage Attention is&nbsp; the fastest attention for video generation,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rAwZv0hEcU&t=524) so you can use it and you are seeing&nbsp; that it is really, really high quality.

- [00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rAwZv0hEcU&t=527) Okay, video has been generated, but I made a&nbsp; mistake. I didn't select the LoRA. Therefore,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rAwZv0hEcU&t=533) the video quality is terrible with 8 steps.&nbsp; So let's select LoRA and generate again. Do&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rAwZv0hEcU&t=539) not make this mistake. You need to select&nbsp; both base model and also the LoRA model,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rAwZv0hEcU&t=544) like here. Also, I am frequently getting asked&nbsp; how you can change the LoRA weights, LoRA power,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rAwZv0hEcU&t=551) LoRA scale. You see there is, it says that 1. So&nbsp; this is the LoRA scale, the LoRA power, the LoRA&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rAwZv0hEcU&t=557) impact it is using. You can change it from here.&nbsp; This applies to all LoRAs. Either it is Flux LoRA,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rAwZv0hEcU&t=564) it is video generation model LoRA, whatever it is,&nbsp; this is how you can set the selected LoRA. You can&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rAwZv0hEcU&t=570) also select multiple LoRAs. For example, I can&nbsp; select both of them, and I can set LoRA weight,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rAwZv0hEcU&t=576) LoRA scale, each one of them like this. So this&nbsp; is how SwarmUI works. I'm just showing you a&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rAwZv0hEcU&t=582) general knowledge which can be very useful&nbsp; because I am getting asked of this all the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rAwZv0hEcU&t=587) time. This is how you can set LoRA weight, LoRA&nbsp; scale, LoRA impact, whichever you may call it.

- [00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rAwZv0hEcU&t=593) Okay, so the video has been generated. Let's&nbsp; see the difference. Okay, this is very,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rAwZv0hEcU&t=598) very better video. It could be better with a&nbsp; better prompting. I'm just using some random&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rAwZv0hEcU&t=603) prompt. Probably it was made for image to video.&nbsp; And there is one another thing I would like to&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rAwZv0hEcU&t=609) show you. This is our ultimate video upscaler. It&nbsp; will have so many features. I am still developing,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rAwZv0hEcU&t=614) I am adding so many features. This is industry&nbsp; level upscaling. It is diffusion based. It&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rAwZv0hEcU&t=621) supports frame window based upscaling. What it&nbsp; means that by default, it is processing 32 frames&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rAwZv0hEcU&t=629) at a time. Therefore, it prevents flickering,&nbsp; it prevents other issues. It also supports&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rAwZv0hEcU&t=636) sliding window upscaling as well, which means&nbsp; that transition between processed chunks have&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rAwZv0hEcU&t=643) more consistency. It supports everything. This is&nbsp; literally going to be the ultimate video upscaler,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rAwZv0hEcU&t=649) many times better than Topaz AI because we have&nbsp; automatically splitting every video into scenes,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rAwZv0hEcU&t=657) and we are automatically captioning them&nbsp; because since this is diffusion based,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rAwZv0hEcU&t=661) the caption matters a lot. Currently, we have&nbsp; CogVLM2 captioning with 4-bit quantization&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rAwZv0hEcU&t=668) working amazing. And we have so many features:&nbsp; batch processing, FPS decrease and increase. Why?&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rAwZv0hEcU&t=675) Because you can decrease FPS to half and make your&nbsp; upscaling 2 times faster, then you can use RIFE&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rAwZv0hEcU&t=683) frame interpolation to increase FPS. Also, we&nbsp; have output comparison, and I have developed a,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rAwZv0hEcU&t=690) a feature here that you can upload any&nbsp; two videos, like this one, and generate&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rAwZv0hEcU&t=695) a comparison video according to their aspect&nbsp; ratio. So let's click manual comparison video,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rAwZv0hEcU&t=701) and let's click download. This is how I made this&nbsp; comparison video. And it is really, really good&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rAwZv0hEcU&t=707) to see impact of different videos. But this is&nbsp; not all yet. There is also another application&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rAwZv0hEcU&t=713) that I have developed: start video comparison up&nbsp; file. Choose the files from here. This is a video&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rAwZv0hEcU&t=720) slider. You see? This is just amazing, and it is&nbsp; working really, really fast and efficient. All&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rAwZv0hEcU&t=726) of these are running locally. I will share&nbsp; everything once all of them are completed.

- [00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rAwZv0hEcU&t=731) And you see on the right, it is CausVid&nbsp; with LoRA version 1. On the left,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rAwZv0hEcU&t=736) it is CausVid with LoRA version 2. There is a&nbsp; huge quality difference, huge improvement. So&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rAwZv0hEcU&t=742) this is just amazing. With just 8 steps, we&nbsp; get this much quality improvement. This is&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rAwZv0hEcU&t=747) just amazing. This application is not published&nbsp; yet because I am still developing it. I am still&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rAwZv0hEcU&t=753) adding features such as I will add presets,&nbsp; save your config, load your config. There may&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rAwZv0hEcU&t=758) be other new features. Therefore, if you have&nbsp; any recommendation, suggestions, please make&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rAwZv0hEcU&t=765) your recommendations to me. I am time to time&nbsp; sharing on our Patreon and also on our Reddit&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rAwZv0hEcU&t=771) the progress. So therefore, it is really important&nbsp; for you to make recommendations to me. Hopefully,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rAwZv0hEcU&t=777) I will publish it as soon as possible because&nbsp; I know that so many people is waiting for this,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rAwZv0hEcU&t=782) and hopefully it will be amazing.&nbsp; So thank you so much. See you later.
