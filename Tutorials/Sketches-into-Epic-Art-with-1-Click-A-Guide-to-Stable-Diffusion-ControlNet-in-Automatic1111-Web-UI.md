Generative image AI models are becoming increasingly popular, as they offer exciting new ways to create digital artwork and visual media. One such model that has gained a lot of attention in recent years is the Stable Diffusion model, which is a free, open-source algorithm for generating high-quality images.

The Stable Diffusion model is based on a technique called diffusion processes, which involve gradually smoothing out noise in an image. This results in a progression of images that become progressively less noisy and more detailed over time. By controlling the speed and direction of the diffusion process, the model can be used to generate a wide variety of images, ranging from abstract art to realistic photos.

Another advantage of the Stable Diffusion model is its versatility. Because it is based on a probabilistic process, it can be used to generate a wide variety of different types of images, from landscapes to portraits to abstract art. This makes it an ideal tool for artists and designers who want to experiment with different styles and techniques.



### Video Transcription


- [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhqqmkTBMlU&t=0) Greetings everyone.

- [00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhqqmkTBMlU&t=1) In this video, I am going to show you how to use ControlNet, which is a neural network

- [00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhqqmkTBMlU&t=6) structure to control diffusion models by adding extra conditions.

- [00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhqqmkTBMlU&t=10) And you may wonder what does this do?

- [00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhqqmkTBMlU&t=12) With ControlNet, we are able to utilize Stable Diffusion models much better than before.

- [00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhqqmkTBMlU&t=18) For example, they have a Canny Edge app, which allows you to provide any image like this

- [00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhqqmkTBMlU&t=25) and get any images like this with just prompting.

- [00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhqqmkTBMlU&t=28) Or with M-LSD lines, provide any image like this and get images like this.

- [00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhqqmkTBMlU&t=34) Or my favorite, which is user scribbles.

- [00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhqqmkTBMlU&t=38) With user scribbles, you are providing a sketch, a scribble like this, and you are able to

- [00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhqqmkTBMlU&t=44) get awesome images like this.

- [00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhqqmkTBMlU&t=46) I already have a video that shows how to use ControlNet with their native released Python

- [00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhqqmkTBMlU&t=53) apps.

- [00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhqqmkTBMlU&t=54) This is the video of it.

- [00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhqqmkTBMlU&t=55) You can watch it if you want.

- [00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhqqmkTBMlU&t=56) However, in this video, I am going to show you how to use ControlNet with Automatic1111

- [00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhqqmkTBMlU&t=63) web UI, which is the most famous and most advanced Stable Diffusion user interface available

- [00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhqqmkTBMlU&t=71) that is community developed.

- [00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhqqmkTBMlU&t=73) So for demonstration purposes, I will install a new fresh web UI.

- [00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhqqmkTBMlU&t=78) For installing Automatic1111 web UI You only need Python to be installed in your computer

- [00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhqqmkTBMlU&t=85) and its default path should have been set.

- [00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhqqmkTBMlU&t=88) So you see when I type Python into my command line interface, I am getting Python 3.10.8

- [00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhqqmkTBMlU&t=96) version is installed and set as default.

- [00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhqqmkTBMlU&t=99) If you don't know how to install Automatic1111 web UI, I already have an excellent tutorial

- [00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhqqmkTBMlU&t=104) for that and another tutorial for that.

- [00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhqqmkTBMlU&t=107) So for installing a fresh copy, I am entering inside my C drive, generating a new folder

- [00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhqqmkTBMlU&t=113) like this.

- [00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhqqmkTBMlU&t=114) I am giving it a name as control net automatic entering inside the folder, typing CMD in

- [00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhqqmkTBMlU&t=122) the folder path.

- [00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhqqmkTBMlU&t=123) You see it has opened a new CMD window and the path of it is like this.

- [00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhqqmkTBMlU&t=129) I'm just going to type git clone, copying the URL of the Automatic1111 web UI, pasting

- [00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhqqmkTBMlU&t=135) it and hitting enter.

- [00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhqqmkTBMlU&t=137) It will clone the whole GitHub repository into my folder.

- [00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhqqmkTBMlU&t=141) To be able to use git command You need to have installed any git software such as Git

- [00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhqqmkTBMlU&t=147) Bash.

- [00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhqqmkTBMlU&t=148) I have installed this in my computer.

- [00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhqqmkTBMlU&t=150) After that, enter the folder where you have copied the files and in here we just need

- [00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhqqmkTBMlU&t=156) to change the webui-user.bat right click edit and I am going to only add one command to

- [00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhqqmkTBMlU&t=165) it, which is --xformers.

- [00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhqqmkTBMlU&t=168) Save it, close it and just click it and run it.

- [00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhqqmkTBMlU&t=171) It will install everything for you.

- [00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhqqmkTBMlU&t=174) There is one more thing we need to do.

- [00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhqqmkTBMlU&t=175) We need to get the Stable Diffusion model inside our models, Stable Diffusion folder.

- [00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhqqmkTBMlU&t=181) As a model.

- [00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhqqmkTBMlU&t=182) I am going to use 1.5 pruned ckpt file, which is the official Stable Diffusion 1.5 version.

- [00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhqqmkTBMlU&t=189) Just click download.

- [00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhqqmkTBMlU&t=191) After the file has been downloaded.

- [00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhqqmkTBMlU&t=193) Just copy it and paste it into your installation, inside models, inside Stable Diffusion folder

- [00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhqqmkTBMlU&t=199) like this.

- [00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhqqmkTBMlU&t=200) Then you will be ready to use Stable Diffusion on Automatic1111 web UI.

- [00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhqqmkTBMlU&t=205) The fresh installation of the Automatic1111 web UI have been completed.

- [00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhqqmkTBMlU&t=211) Now we will run this URL.

- [00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhqqmkTBMlU&t=213) To be able to use control net with Automatic1111 web UI.

- [00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhqqmkTBMlU&t=216) We are going to use sd-webui-controlnet extension made by Mikubill.

- [00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhqqmkTBMlU&t=223) So copy the URL of the repo, go to the extensions tab of your web UI, go to the install from

- [00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhqqmkTBMlU&t=230) URL, copy paste the link and click install.

- [00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhqqmkTBMlU&t=234) And it has been installed.

- [00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhqqmkTBMlU&t=235) After the first time installed.

- [00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhqqmkTBMlU&t=237) Just close and restart the web UI to be sure that all of the dependencies are correctly

- [00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhqqmkTBMlU&t=242) installed.

- [00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhqqmkTBMlU&t=243) By the way, you see currently my xformers is 0.0.16.

- [00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhqqmkTBMlU&t=249) If you want to do training, then you should downgrade these to 0.0.14.

- [00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhqqmkTBMlU&t=255) Because with Dreambooth and Textual Inversion currently latest xformers is not working very

- [00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhqqmkTBMlU&t=259) well.

- [00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhqqmkTBMlU&t=260) I already have an excellent tutorial video for how to downgrade xformers to the version

- [00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhqqmkTBMlU&t=266) that it will work properly with Dreambooth or Textual Inversion.

- [00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhqqmkTBMlU&t=270) Okay, our web UI has been restarted.

- [00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhqqmkTBMlU&t=273) Let's refresh our UI.

- [00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhqqmkTBMlU&t=274) There is a notice of the developer.

- [00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhqqmkTBMlU&t=276) If you get encountered any error, just run this command in your command line window.

- [00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhqqmkTBMlU&t=283) Open your command line window, right click and run it.

- [00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhqqmkTBMlU&t=287) If you get error, then you should do this.

- [00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhqqmkTBMlU&t=289) Restart has been completed.

- [00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhqqmkTBMlU&t=291) To be able to use control net we need to download the files hosted on Hugging Face repository.

- [00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhqqmkTBMlU&t=297) You can download them manually one by one by clicking them, clicking the file and click

- [00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhqqmkTBMlU&t=303) download.

- [00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhqqmkTBMlU&t=304) But there is an easier way.

- [00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhqqmkTBMlU&t=305) Just copy the URL of the repository.

- [00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhqqmkTBMlU&t=308) Then make a new folder in anywhere in your drive like control net models.

- [00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhqqmkTBMlU&t=314) Enter inside the folder type CMD.

- [00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhqqmkTBMlU&t=318) You see this is the folder where I am right now.

- [00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhqqmkTBMlU&t=320) Type git clone, then right click and paste URL and hit enter.

- [00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhqqmkTBMlU&t=324) It will start cloning into that folder.

- [00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhqqmkTBMlU&t=327) All of the files are over 85 gigabytes, so it will take a lot of time if your internet

- [00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhqqmkTBMlU&t=333) connection is slow and it doesn't display any messages for the status of the download.

- [00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhqqmkTBMlU&t=339) How can you know whether the download has been completed or not?

- [00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhqqmkTBMlU&t=343) Open task manager, go to the performance tab and in here go to your ethernet tab and in

- [00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhqqmkTBMlU&t=349) here you will see the data transfer.

- [00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhqqmkTBMlU&t=351) When this data transfer has ended, that means that your download has been completed.

- [00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhqqmkTBMlU&t=358) All the files have been downloaded.

- [00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhqqmkTBMlU&t=359) Now we need to put these files into the correct folder for this extension to work.

- [00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhqqmkTBMlU&t=365) Just cut the models folder, go back to your Stable Diffusion installation, go to the extensions

- [00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhqqmkTBMlU&t=370) folder, go to the SD web UI control net extension and paste it there.

- [00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhqqmkTBMlU&t=375) It will be merged with the existing models folder.

- [00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhqqmkTBMlU&t=378) Then you need to restart your command line interface web UI, then start again.

- [00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhqqmkTBMlU&t=384) After web UI has been restarted, refresh your web UI interface, go to the text to image

- [00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhqqmkTBMlU&t=389) tab and in here now you will see ControlNet script.

- [00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhqqmkTBMlU&t=394) Click it, click enable, click refresh models.

- [00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhqqmkTBMlU&t=397) It will refresh the model list like this.

- [00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhqqmkTBMlU&t=399) Then, for example, select scribble and select the fake scribble preprocessor.

- [00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhqqmkTBMlU&t=405) Then when you go to the bottom, you will see open drawing canvas or drop image here.

- [00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhqqmkTBMlU&t=411) Click to upload.

- [00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhqqmkTBMlU&t=413) I am clicking.

- [00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhqqmkTBMlU&t=414) I am selecting this and I am typing my prompt.

- [00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhqqmkTBMlU&t=419) It generates.

- [00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhqqmkTBMlU&t=420) It will download the necessary files afterwards.

- [00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhqqmkTBMlU&t=423) You hit the generate for the first time.

- [00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhqqmkTBMlU&t=425) We got the result.

- [00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhqqmkTBMlU&t=426) However, this is not as expected, so I will try with preprocessor none hit generate.

- [00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhqqmkTBMlU&t=432) We got the result again, but this is again not as expected.

- [00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhqqmkTBMlU&t=436) So what we need to do is check box this scribble mode.

- [00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhqqmkTBMlU&t=440) Then I checked the envelope outer fit and it generated the image like this.

- [00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhqqmkTBMlU&t=446) The generated image size is 512 512.

- [00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhqqmkTBMlU&t=449) Then I tried the original resolution of the artwork like this.

- [00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhqqmkTBMlU&t=453) The target resolution 866 and the height 684.

- [00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhqqmkTBMlU&t=459) Also the canvas width is 866 and the canvas height is 684.

- [00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhqqmkTBMlU&t=466) As you can see and the generated image is pretty good, pretty decent.

- [00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhqqmkTBMlU&t=470) This is the base mask or the depth it is using to generate this image and it is working awesome

- [00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhqqmkTBMlU&t=478) as you can see.

- [00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhqqmkTBMlU&t=479) We can also pick another model from our drop down and let's also try with anything v3.

- [00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhqqmkTBMlU&t=486) With anything v3 this is the image we got in the first try.

- [00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhqqmkTBMlU&t=490) Then I generated eight images as a batch size and the results are just simply amazing.

- [00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhqqmkTBMlU&t=496) You can generate hundreds of images and pick the best one you like and the quality is just

- [00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhqqmkTBMlU&t=501) amazing.

- [00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhqqmkTBMlU&t=502) Look at this quality.

- [00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhqqmkTBMlU&t=503) There is almost no artifacts and it looks pretty amazing.

- [00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhqqmkTBMlU&t=509) It will take a lot of hours to just draw this color it as you can see the textures the shading

- [00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhqqmkTBMlU&t=515) the lightning everything is looking pretty awesome and this is also not a cherry pick.

- [00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhqqmkTBMlU&t=521) I just clicked hit generate and I am showing you the results.

- [00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhqqmkTBMlU&t=524) So with cherry picking you can get much better results.

- [00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhqqmkTBMlU&t=528) So using the original width and height of the image both in canvas and in here also

- [00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhqqmkTBMlU&t=537) making the options as like this is resulting in the best output.

- [00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhqqmkTBMlU&t=542) So for your target you should try different settings and see what is working best for

- [00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhqqmkTBMlU&t=549) you.

- [00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhqqmkTBMlU&t=550) Don't forget to check low VRAM if you get out of memory error.

- [00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhqqmkTBMlU&t=554) This extension is better than the official implementation because it is allowing you

- [00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhqqmkTBMlU&t=560) to use different models as well.

- [00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhqqmkTBMlU&t=563) It is very well done.

- [00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhqqmkTBMlU&t=564) So from the official page you can learn more about the other models and you can also apply

- [00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhqqmkTBMlU&t=572) them.

- [00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhqqmkTBMlU&t=573) For example I will also apply this Canny Edge.

- [00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhqqmkTBMlU&t=576) So for Canny Edge example I am going to use the generated image like this.

- [00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhqqmkTBMlU&t=581) Then let's pick the Canny Edge from model and let's see what we are going to get.

- [00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhqqmkTBMlU&t=586) I am going to uncheck scribble mode.

- [00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhqqmkTBMlU&t=588) Okay we got a very different results as you can see.

- [00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhqqmkTBMlU&t=592) Let's also try the example that the official authors have provided with Canny Edge and

- [00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhqqmkTBMlU&t=598) see what we are going to get.

- [00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhqqmkTBMlU&t=600) But before that let's try with scribble mode with Canny Edge.

- [00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhqqmkTBMlU&t=604) Okay with scribble mode and the Canny Edge we are getting nothing simply.

- [00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhqqmkTBMlU&t=608) Okay this is the image that the developers of ControlNet have provided for Canny Edge.

- [00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhqqmkTBMlU&t=614) It is 564 pixels multiplied with 846 pixels.

- [00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhqqmkTBMlU&t=620) I have entered the dimensions of the input image and just typed as bird and we got this

- [00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhqqmkTBMlU&t=626) image.

- [00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhqqmkTBMlU&t=627) This is not like expected so let's also try with the preprocessor.

- [00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhqqmkTBMlU&t=632) And after we select the preprocessor we got a really good result as you can see because

- [00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhqqmkTBMlU&t=637) the preprocessor has extracted this expected mask or let's say scribble than the generated

- [00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhqqmkTBMlU&t=645) image as expected as you can see.

- [00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhqqmkTBMlU&t=648) So let's also test the M-LSD lines.

- [00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhqqmkTBMlU&t=650) To do that I am going to use the same image as the official authors have used.

- [00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhqqmkTBMlU&t=656) So just drag and drop the image here.

- [00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhqqmkTBMlU&t=659) Let's enter its dimension.

- [00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhqqmkTBMlU&t=661) Then I am going to select the preprocessor as M-LSD and I am going to select the model

- [00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhqqmkTBMlU&t=667) as M-LSD and let's change the prompt first room and hit the generate and you see it has

- [00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhqqmkTBMlU&t=674) detected the lines of the image and generated the room according to that.

- [00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhqqmkTBMlU&t=678) It is working awesome.

- [00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhqqmkTBMlU&t=680) You can do the other examples yourself.

- [00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhqqmkTBMlU&t=682) They should just work fine.

- [00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhqqmkTBMlU&t=684) It is working very well.

- [00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhqqmkTBMlU&t=685) So far this is the best extension for ControlNet for the Automatic1111 web UI.

- [00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhqqmkTBMlU&t=692) It provides all of the features of web UI to us with awesomeness of the using any model

- [00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhqqmkTBMlU&t=699) that we want.

- [00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhqqmkTBMlU&t=701) For generating the thumbnail image of the video.

- [00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhqqmkTBMlU&t=704) I have used anything v3 public Stable Diffusion model.

- [00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhqqmkTBMlU&t=708) Also I have used this positive prompt and the negative prompt.

- [00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhqqmkTBMlU&t=712) Then I did set the batch count as 100 batch sizes 8.

- [00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhqqmkTBMlU&t=716) My graphic card RTX 3060 has 12 gigabyte VRAM memory and it is able to process batch size

- [00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhqqmkTBMlU&t=723) as 8.

- [00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhqqmkTBMlU&t=725) For preprocessor Canny and model Canny model.

- [00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhqqmkTBMlU&t=728) Also I did set scale to fit and canvas width and height are 1024.

- [00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhqqmkTBMlU&t=735) I did set the seed as -1 and the output resolution as 512 and 512.

- [00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhqqmkTBMlU&t=741) So you see this is the image that I have used.

- [00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhqqmkTBMlU&t=744) Here the image the base image that I have used.

- [00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhqqmkTBMlU&t=747) This is a free sketchy image that you can download from the internet.

- [00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhqqmkTBMlU&t=751) Then I have generated hundreds of images and picked the best one that I liked.

- [00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhqqmkTBMlU&t=757) These are the images that it has generated.

- [00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhqqmkTBMlU&t=760) For upscaling the selected image.

- [00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhqqmkTBMlU&t=762) I went to the extensions tab, load from.

- [00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhqqmkTBMlU&t=765) It loaded all of the extensions.

- [00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhqqmkTBMlU&t=767) Search for ultimate SD upscale.

- [00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhqqmkTBMlU&t=770) Click install.

- [00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhqqmkTBMlU&t=771) After the installation has been completed you will see this message then go to the installed

- [00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhqqmkTBMlU&t=776) tab apply and restart ui.

- [00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhqqmkTBMlU&t=778) For updating the extensions you can go to the extensions tab click check for updates

- [00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhqqmkTBMlU&t=783) and if there is an any update just click apply and restart UI.

- [00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhqqmkTBMlU&t=787) It will update the extension for you.

- [00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhqqmkTBMlU&t=789) But the first time installations restarting the web UI CMD could be better.

- [00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhqqmkTBMlU&t=794) Go to the image to image tab.

- [00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhqqmkTBMlU&t=796) Type your prompts as you have used to generate your image or type the prompts about your

- [00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhqqmkTBMlU&t=802) image that you want to upscale.

- [00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhqqmkTBMlU&t=804) Drag and drop your image like this.

- [00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhqqmkTBMlU&t=807) Go to the bottom and in here set your target resolution.

- [00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhqqmkTBMlU&t=810) For example i have upscaled from 512 to 1024.

- [00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhqqmkTBMlU&t=816) Reduce to deionizing strength.

- [00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhqqmkTBMlU&t=817) This is really important.

- [00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhqqmkTBMlU&t=819) If you set this over 0.3 then the image will be changed a lot.

- [00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhqqmkTBMlU&t=824) This is something that you can play with.

- [00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhqqmkTBMlU&t=827) Also in the frequently asked questions of the ultimate upscale for Automatic1111 there

- [00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhqqmkTBMlU&t=831) are a lot of information.

- [00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhqqmkTBMlU&t=834) You can read them and try to understand better how it works.

- [00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhqqmkTBMlU&t=837) Then in the bottom select ultimate SD upscale.

- [00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhqqmkTBMlU&t=841) Make sure that ControlNet is not enabled.

- [00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhqqmkTBMlU&t=845) Select from image to image settings for upscale target size.

- [00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhqqmkTBMlU&t=848) There are redraw options.

- [00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhqqmkTBMlU&t=849) You can try them.

- [00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhqqmkTBMlU&t=850) Currently i use none.

- [00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhqqmkTBMlU&t=853) Selected type as chess.

- [00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhqqmkTBMlU&t=855) Set the tile width and height for 512.

- [00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhqqmkTBMlU&t=857) However, this depends on what you want to achieve the results you get.

- [00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhqqmkTBMlU&t=861) So reading FAQ is really important.

- [00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhqqmkTBMlU&t=865) Then i didn't set the seems fix and i click it to save options upscaled.

- [00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhqqmkTBMlU&t=870) The upscaled version is here.

- [00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhqqmkTBMlU&t=872) You see it has significantly improved the image quality as you can see and also it is

- [00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhqqmkTBMlU&t=879) upscaled.

- [00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhqqmkTBMlU&t=880) Let me show you the comparison.

- [00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhqqmkTBMlU&t=882) So this is the our base image the tested image and this is our upscaled image.

- [00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhqqmkTBMlU&t=887) As you can see it is much better quality than it is but it is the same image as you can

- [00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhqqmkTBMlU&t=893) see almost same.

- [00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhqqmkTBMlU&t=894) Because with hd upscale it is slightly modifying the image and this is how I did upscaling

- [00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhqqmkTBMlU&t=901) for the generated image.

- [00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhqqmkTBMlU&t=903) If you don't know what is Stable Diffusion if you don't know how to install web ui, if

- [00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhqqmkTBMlU&t=908) you want to learn more about Stable Diffusion and Automatic1111 web ui i have excellent
