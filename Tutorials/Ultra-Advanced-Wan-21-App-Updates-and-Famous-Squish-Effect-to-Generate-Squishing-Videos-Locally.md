### Video Transcription


- [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueMrzmbdWBg&t=0) Greetings everyone. Today I am going to show you&nbsp; the newest updates of our Wan 2.1 application,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueMrzmbdWBg&t=6) and also newly arrived squishing video effect,&nbsp; a LoRA model that you can use with Wan 2.1 720p&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueMrzmbdWBg&t=15) model or 480p model. It is working with both&nbsp; of them. This is really, really high quality.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueMrzmbdWBg&t=21) It is like paid services that you have seen, but&nbsp; this is running on my local Windows computer. It&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueMrzmbdWBg&t=27) is just running amazingly, and I will also show&nbsp; you all of the new updates we have made for our&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueMrzmbdWBg&t=33) amazing application, such as we have added "Apply&nbsp; Practical RIFE", which doubles the FPS. I mean,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueMrzmbdWBg&t=39) look at the smoothness of this video. This is 30&nbsp; FPS, and it is looking amazing, amazing quality.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueMrzmbdWBg&t=45) This is also the second run that I made for this,&nbsp; so it is not like a very cherry pick. And also,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueMrzmbdWBg&t=51) we have added some other features. Now we are&nbsp; supporting FP8 as well as the BF16. We have&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueMrzmbdWBg&t=57) added LoRA model support. You can download your&nbsp; LoRAs, select here, apply LoRA scale. We have&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueMrzmbdWBg&t=63) improved our "Save Prompt to File." Let me show&nbsp; you which information is saved. Let's open the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueMrzmbdWBg&t=70) outputs folder, and let's open the generation&nbsp; parameters, for example, this one. Now it is&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueMrzmbdWBg&t=75) saving everything, every parameter, as you are&nbsp; seeing right now. We have fixed a lot of issues,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueMrzmbdWBg&t=80) and we have added configuration. So you can&nbsp; save your config, let's say, my squish LoRA,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueMrzmbdWBg&t=87) and you can save your config, then you can load&nbsp; your config, and it will remember. Moreover, it&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueMrzmbdWBg&t=92) will remember your last used config or your last&nbsp; saved config. So we have added so many features,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueMrzmbdWBg&t=97) and let me demonstrate you how to use this&nbsp; amazing application on your Windows locally.

- [00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueMrzmbdWBg&t=104) So first of all, this is the second video of&nbsp; the initial tutorial video. When you click here,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueMrzmbdWBg&t=109) I will also put it into the description of&nbsp; the video. This is our previous main tutorial&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueMrzmbdWBg&t=113) where I have explained everything about Wan&nbsp; 2.1 application. Since the tutorial has been&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueMrzmbdWBg&t=119) published, I have made so many new updates and&nbsp; added so many new features, so let's go and see&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueMrzmbdWBg&t=125) them. So the link will be in the description of&nbsp; the video. When you go to the main post link,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueMrzmbdWBg&t=129) you will get to this page. I really recommend&nbsp; you to read from top to bottom to see all the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueMrzmbdWBg&t=135) updates we have made. You see, this is our&nbsp; 10-March update, this is our 7-March update,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueMrzmbdWBg&t=141) this is our 6-March update, and it goes to up to&nbsp; the date when I have published the initial video,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueMrzmbdWBg&t=147) which was 10 days ago. So I really recommend&nbsp; you to read everything here and learn every new&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueMrzmbdWBg&t=153) update. But don't worry, I will show you quickly&nbsp; the new updates as well. So download the latest&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueMrzmbdWBg&t=157) zip file. I really recommend you to make a fresh&nbsp; installation. It is not mandatory, but if you make&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueMrzmbdWBg&t=163) that, that is better because it will install&nbsp; all the latest libraries and everything. Once&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueMrzmbdWBg&t=169) you extract it, you will just run the "Windows&nbsp; Install All GPUs.bat" file, and it will install&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueMrzmbdWBg&t=175) everything automatically for you. Run anyway. So&nbsp; just wait for installation to be completed. This&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueMrzmbdWBg&t=179) will install the latest libraries, latest Torch&nbsp; version, Flash Attention, Triton, DeepSpeed,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueMrzmbdWBg&t=186) and everything automatically into a virtual&nbsp; environment, and it will be totally isolated.

- [00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueMrzmbdWBg&t=191) Once the installation has been started, you&nbsp; can begin downloading the models. You see,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueMrzmbdWBg&t=196) there is "Windows Download Models.bat" file.&nbsp; Double-click it, more info, run anyway,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueMrzmbdWBg&t=200) and it will ask you which models you want to&nbsp; download. So we are supporting all these models,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueMrzmbdWBg&t=206) as I have shown in the tutorial&nbsp; video, and also, additionally,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueMrzmbdWBg&t=210) we have added this Squish LoRA to download&nbsp; automatically. So you can select option 6,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueMrzmbdWBg&t=216) and it will download all of the models&nbsp; automatically for you. So meanwhile,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueMrzmbdWBg&t=220) it is installing, you can also download all&nbsp; of the models as well. If you don't want to&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueMrzmbdWBg&t=224) download all of the models, it is also fine.&nbsp; Just enter the models like this: 1, 3, and 5,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueMrzmbdWBg&t=231) and it will download them. Separate them with a&nbsp; comma, do not put space characters, and it will&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueMrzmbdWBg&t=236) download this model. And with all optimizations&nbsp; we have made, preventing duplicate downloads,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueMrzmbdWBg&t=241) downloading FP16 weights, it is now taking 110&nbsp; GB of space for all these models. These are huge&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueMrzmbdWBg&t=249) models, by the way. So just wait for models to&nbsp; be downloaded and installation to be completed.

- [00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueMrzmbdWBg&t=255) Once the installation completed, you need&nbsp; to start the application. First of all,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueMrzmbdWBg&t=259) if you get errors related to Triton package, I&nbsp; have added "Clear Triton Cache.bat" file. This will&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueMrzmbdWBg&t=265) delete the Triton cache and also temporary files&nbsp; in your temporary folder, then your Triton will&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueMrzmbdWBg&t=271) work. After that, click the "Start App.bat"&nbsp; file. I also have two duplicate files,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueMrzmbdWBg&t=277) as in the previous video, so that I can start&nbsp; on individual GPUs that I have both of them.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueMrzmbdWBg&t=282) Once the interface started, whichever model you&nbsp; want to use, let's use the 480p model, so select&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueMrzmbdWBg&t=287) it. Select your aspect ratio accordingly. Select&nbsp; your GPU preset according to your GPU. Moreover,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueMrzmbdWBg&t=293) if you want to save more VRAM, you can also&nbsp; load as an FP8, but BF16 is also working very&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueMrzmbdWBg&t=300) well. We also have "Apply Practical RIFE" now,&nbsp; which is another AI model to increase the FPS,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueMrzmbdWBg&t=306) like 2x or 4x. Let me show you the difference&nbsp; it makes. So let's open the outputs folder,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueMrzmbdWBg&t=312) and it will save both of them like the regular&nbsp; and the improved version. So this is regular&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueMrzmbdWBg&t=316) version. Pay attention to it; it is slow, as you&nbsp; are seeing. It is not smooth. And let's open the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueMrzmbdWBg&t=323) improved with RIFE. You see the smoothness?&nbsp; It is way, way better, and it is not even&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueMrzmbdWBg&t=328) noticeable. This is working very well. This is&nbsp; using the latest RIFE model. I have researched&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueMrzmbdWBg&t=333) it. This is the highest quality FPS increase&nbsp; that you can get. This is the highest quality&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueMrzmbdWBg&t=338) of frame interpolation. It is all made into&nbsp; our application. You don't need to do anything.

- [00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueMrzmbdWBg&t=343) Then you should type your prompt, and for&nbsp; this LoRA, the today's topic, there is an&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueMrzmbdWBg&t=349) activation trigger word. The trigger word is&nbsp; written in our post. When you go to the news,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueMrzmbdWBg&t=355) you will see that this is the trigger word. So&nbsp; let's copy-paste it into our prompt. Select the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueMrzmbdWBg&t=359) LoRA from here. By the way, our application&nbsp; supports all of the LoRAs from the CivitAI,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueMrzmbdWBg&t=365) and where do you need to put the LoRAs? It is&nbsp; so easy. Let me show you. Enter Wan 2.1 folder,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueMrzmbdWBg&t=371) and you will see there is "LoRAs." If you don't&nbsp; see this, you can generate it yourself and put&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueMrzmbdWBg&t=376) the LoRAs here. Then, after you put the&nbsp; LoRAs there, go here, click refresh LoRAs,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueMrzmbdWBg&t=382) and select the LoRA that you want to use. So type&nbsp; your prompt, then upload your image because this&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueMrzmbdWBg&t=387) is image-to-video model. So let me upload my&nbsp; model, and it is amazing that you don't need to&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueMrzmbdWBg&t=393) type any other prompt, just the activation prompt.&nbsp; Big kudos to the maker of this LoRA. Hopefully,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueMrzmbdWBg&t=399) I will also make a full tutorial for how to&nbsp; train your own LoRAs. Step by step tutorial, it&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueMrzmbdWBg&t=405) is coming hopefully. Then verify your parameters.&nbsp; Currently, this is going to generate 81 frames,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueMrzmbdWBg&t=411) so it will be 5 seconds video. If you want faster&nbsp; generation, you can make this lower. How you can&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueMrzmbdWBg&t=417) make this lower? 16 frames + 1 = 1 second. So if&nbsp; you want to make 3 seconds, it is 3 multiplied&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueMrzmbdWBg&t=425) with 16, 48 + 1, 49 frames. So this will generate&nbsp; 49 frames video. Also, if you want to speed up,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueMrzmbdWBg&t=433) you can reduce the inference steps. Let's try 20&nbsp; as a demonstration, and that's it. You don't need&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueMrzmbdWBg&t=437) to change anything. As I said, make sure that&nbsp; your aspect ratio is accurate and generate.

- [00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueMrzmbdWBg&t=442) The generation has started. Let's see&nbsp; our GPU usage nvitop like this,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueMrzmbdWBg&t=448) and this is our GPU usage. The generation speed&nbsp; will appear here. I am recording a video right&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueMrzmbdWBg&t=453) now, so it will be slower. Moreover, if you&nbsp; don't want to set these parameters each time,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueMrzmbdWBg&t=459) just save a configuration, and my application will&nbsp; remember it whenever you restart your application,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueMrzmbdWBg&t=465) it will automatically load that last configuration&nbsp; from here, and it will set all the parameters as&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueMrzmbdWBg&t=471) you left. This is just an amazing feature; it&nbsp; took a lot of time to code it. So the generation&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueMrzmbdWBg&t=475) started, and it is taking 16 seconds per IT right&nbsp; now. I know this is not very fast. Hopefully,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueMrzmbdWBg&t=481) it will get at least 2 times faster when I&nbsp; implement Teacache. We are waiting implementation&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueMrzmbdWBg&t=488) to DiffSynth-Studio, which we are using, which&nbsp; is the backbone of our application. You see,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueMrzmbdWBg&t=493) there is add Teacache support. The author replied&nbsp; to us; hopefully, it is coming very soon,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueMrzmbdWBg&t=497) and as soon as it arrives, I will also implement&nbsp; it. With that, hopefully, the durations, the speed&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueMrzmbdWBg&t=503) will get double. But my installer is installing&nbsp; the latest Triton, latest CUDA, latest Torch,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueMrzmbdWBg&t=509) latest Flash Attention. So this is the fastest&nbsp; right now that we can get with the maximum&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueMrzmbdWBg&t=515) quality. We are not sacrificing any quality&nbsp; because people often asking me that ComfyUI&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueMrzmbdWBg&t=521) is working faster or such other things because the&nbsp; settings are not saved. We are doing 50 steps by&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueMrzmbdWBg&t=528) default. We are doing 81 frames by default. These&nbsp; are increasing time and VRAM usage. Moreover,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueMrzmbdWBg&t=534) we are not optimizing anything else with&nbsp; the sacrifice of quality. We are targeting&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueMrzmbdWBg&t=540) the maximum quality. Therefore, it is slower&nbsp; in our application. However, not very slow,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueMrzmbdWBg&t=545) just a little bit slower, and with Teacache, it&nbsp; will be hopefully way faster, like 100% faster.

- [00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueMrzmbdWBg&t=551) So how you can find other LoRAs? Go&nbsp; to the CivitAI, then go to the models,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueMrzmbdWBg&t=557) and select filter. From the filters, select&nbsp; Month, LoRA, and Wan Video, and then you will&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueMrzmbdWBg&t=562) see the Wan compatible LoRAs. Our application is&nbsp; supporting all of them. If it is not supporting,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueMrzmbdWBg&t=569) let me know. And you will be able to use them. You&nbsp; see, this is the LoRA that we are using right now.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueMrzmbdWBg&t=574) Currently, this is being generated on my RTX&nbsp; 5090. The speed would be way faster if I were&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueMrzmbdWBg&t=580) not recording and if there were not so many open&nbsp; applications, but this speed is still really good,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueMrzmbdWBg&t=586) and we don't have Teacache. Once the&nbsp; Teacache arrives, it will be way,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueMrzmbdWBg&t=589) way faster hopefully. And moreover, I really&nbsp; recommend you to watch the main tutorial video&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueMrzmbdWBg&t=594) because this is a short one, which shows all&nbsp; the new features we have added. So therefore,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueMrzmbdWBg&t=599) I really recommend to watch the main tutorial&nbsp; video to learn more about how to use this&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueMrzmbdWBg&t=603) application. I have explained everything in&nbsp; that tutorial video. Like prompt enhance.

- [00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueMrzmbdWBg&t=608) Also, after the tutorial video, we have made&nbsp; a very good improvement to the prompt enhance.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueMrzmbdWBg&t=614) Now it is using quantized model loading.&nbsp; Therefore, it is using like 10 GB of VRAM,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueMrzmbdWBg&t=619) and it is super fast. It should work pretty&nbsp; much on all of the GPUs. It will just be a&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueMrzmbdWBg&t=624) little bit slower if you don't have 10 GB of&nbsp; GPU VRAM. So we keep improving the application&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueMrzmbdWBg&t=629) with the requests of yours, and I am following&nbsp; every news. Hopefully, I plan to add "Hunyuan"&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueMrzmbdWBg&t=635) video to this application as well with the same&nbsp; library, with all of the same optimizations and&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueMrzmbdWBg&t=640) same GPU preset. So our video is almost done.&nbsp; If you want to speed up this VAE decoding part,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueMrzmbdWBg&t=647) you can disable tiled VAE, but make sure that&nbsp; you have sufficient amount of VRAM; otherwise,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueMrzmbdWBg&t=653) you may get out of VRAM error. And now it&nbsp; is increasing its FPS, and it is ready. So&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueMrzmbdWBg&t=659) this is our quick example. Let's see. Wow. Really,&nbsp; really good. You see, this is just 3 second video;&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueMrzmbdWBg&t=665) it was only 20 inference steps, and it only&nbsp; took 300 seconds while recording video.

- [00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueMrzmbdWBg&t=671) Before I am ending this tutorial, I will show you&nbsp; another thing. I am preparing MMAudio tutorial.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueMrzmbdWBg&t=676) It is almost ready, and hopefully it will be&nbsp; published. So what is MMAudio and how to use&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueMrzmbdWBg&t=682) it? I will also quickly show in this tutorial&nbsp; video. Let's open our MMAudio video application,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueMrzmbdWBg&t=688) and let's download this video to show you.&nbsp; So let's start option one. This is a model to&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueMrzmbdWBg&t=694) generate audio to anything. You can generate&nbsp; from text, you can generate to video. So let&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueMrzmbdWBg&t=700) me demonstrate you quickly. Initial loading of&nbsp; MMAudio may take a while, so be prepared to that.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueMrzmbdWBg&t=707) And it is starting, yes, it started. So let's load&nbsp; our video. This is video-to-video to generate an&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueMrzmbdWBg&t=713) audio. Let's make a small prompt like "squishing&nbsp; a toy." Then all you need to do is just submit,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueMrzmbdWBg&t=719) and it will generate audio to this video. Let's&nbsp; see the results. It is also ultra fast. You see,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueMrzmbdWBg&t=724) it took only 5 seconds with 50&nbsp; steps. Let's listen the audio.

- [00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueMrzmbdWBg&t=732) [Audio Plays] The full tutorial for this coming. You can also&nbsp; generate like 10 different seed and pick the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueMrzmbdWBg&t=738) best one. Let's see. Since it is too fast, really,&nbsp; really fast, I mean, it is taking like this speed,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueMrzmbdWBg&t=743) you see 4 second average, you can generate&nbsp; multiple seeds and pick the best one you like.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueMrzmbdWBg&t=748) This is the best audio generation model right now,&nbsp; state of the art. Full tutorial for this coming.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueMrzmbdWBg&t=754) It will be on the channel after this video, so&nbsp; don't worry about it. Every generation is saved&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueMrzmbdWBg&t=758) again as usual. This application also has all the&nbsp; features like saving, batch processing, saving&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueMrzmbdWBg&t=764) configuration. It also supports text-to-audio,&nbsp; image-to-audio, so many stuff, so many features.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueMrzmbdWBg&t=770) The generated videos are being saved here, and&nbsp; they are arrived. Let's listen some of them.

- [00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueMrzmbdWBg&t=779) [Audio Plays]

- [00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueMrzmbdWBg&t=783) Okay, it is like this. Probably we need to&nbsp; make the prompt better. "Squishing a toy sounds&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueMrzmbdWBg&t=788) like this." So play with the prompt, watch the&nbsp; tutorial, and you will see it. Thank you so much&nbsp;&nbsp;
