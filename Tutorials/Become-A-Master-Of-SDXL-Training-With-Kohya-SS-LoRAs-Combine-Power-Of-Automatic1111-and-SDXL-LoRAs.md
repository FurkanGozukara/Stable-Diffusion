- [00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=108) I have prepared a very detailed GitHub readme file.

- [00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=112) All of the instructions and links that you are going to need will be in this file.

- [00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=117) When watching this tutorial, follow the instructions written here.

- [00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=122) Because when you are watching this tutorial, some of the things that I show could be outdated

- [00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=127) because of the speed of the AI development.

- [00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=130) However, I will update this GitHub readme file.

- [00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=133) To be able to follow this tutorial, you need 2 things to be installed on your computer.

- [00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=138) First 1 is Python.

- [00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=140) If you don't know how to install Python, I have this excellent tutorial, watch it.

- [00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=145) For Automatic1111 web UI, Python 3.10.6 is suggested.

- [00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=150) However, I suggest you to install Python 3.10.11.

- [00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=155) Because latest xFormers, which is our mainly used optimizer library, is now requiring 3.10.11.

- [00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=163) And 3.10.11 is working very well.

- [00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=166) Do not use Python 3.11.

- [00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=168) It won't work.

- [00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=170) It has to be 3.10.X version.

- [00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=174) And you also need Git.

- [00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=176) After you installed Python and Git, you are ready to follow this tutorial.

- [00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=180) So I will show you how to download, install, and use Automatic1111 SD web UI with SDXL.

- [00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=188) I have already automatic installer.

- [00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=190) Actually, installing it is very easy, but I am keeping up to date my Patreon post as

- [00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=195) well.

- [00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=196) So let's do both automatic and manual installation.

- [00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=200) When you go to the Patreon post, you will see auto_1111_sdxl.bat file and download_sdxl.py

- [00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=206) file.

- [00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=207) Download both of them.

- [00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=210) Move the files into any folder where you want to install your Automatic1111 web UI.

- [00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=215) This installation will not break or modify your existing another installation.

- [00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=221) Double click auto_1111_sdxl.bat file, click more info, click run anyway, and it will clone

- [00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=227) the Automatic1111 web UI repository, install it with xFormers, and also it will download

- [00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=234) SDXL model files for you.

- [00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=236) Okay.

- [00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=237) Let's also do the manual installation.

- [00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=240) So for manual installation, we will begin with cloning Automatic1111 web UI.

- [00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=245) Copy this, make any new folder, start a new CMD inside that folder like this.

- [00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=251) Begin with cloning.

- [00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=252) So the Automatic1111 web UI has been cloned.

- [00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=254) Let me also show you my Python version.

- [00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=258) Start a new CMD, type Python, and it will display you the Python version as you are

- [00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=264) seeing right now.

- [00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=265) This is important.

- [00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=266) You need to see your Python version like I am seeing 3.10.11.

- [00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=270) Okay.

- [00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=271) After repo has been cloned, enter inside the repo, right click and edit webui-user.bat

- [00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=276) file.

- [00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=278) If you are not seeing the extension, go to view and in here, check file name extensions.

- [00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=284) Then you will see the extension, right click.

- [00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=286) You can edit with notepad, Notepad++, anything.

- [00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=289) I am preferring Notepad++.

- [00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=292) In the command line arguments, we will define --xFormers and --no-half-vae.

- [00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=297) That's it.

- [00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=299) Save it.

- [00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=301) Then double click and it will start installing the Automatic1111 web UI from scratch for

- [00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=307) you.

- [00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=308) If you are wondering why I did add xFormers and --no-half-vae, these are command line

- [00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=313) arguments.

- [00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=314) And when you click this link, you will see all of the command line arguments of Automatic1111

- [00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=319) web UI here.

- [00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=321) SDXL requires --no-half-vae because the default VAE of SDXL is 32 bits.

- [00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=329) Therefore we are adding it.

- [00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=330) xFormers is an optimization library.

- [00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=333) It will speed up our generation and also it will speed our training as well.

- [00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=339) As you are seeing right now, automatic installer is also downloading the model files automatically

- [00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=344) for us.

- [00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=345) So you need to download the SDXL model files if you haven't yet.

- [00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=350) I have put the direct download links here.

- [00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=353) This is the corrected VAE file.

- [00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=355) Open this link and it will start downloading automatically for you as you are seeing right

- [00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=360) now.

- [00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=361) Then we need 1.0 SDXL model.

- [00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=364) I prefer this for LoRA training.

- [00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=366) So open this link.

- [00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=368) These are direct links and it will start downloading that file as well as you are seeing right

- [00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=373) now.

- [00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=374) Once the files have been downloaded, you need to put them into the correct folders.

- [00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=378) Put the sd_xl_base_1.0.safetensors file into the models folder, cut it, move back into

- [00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=386) your installation folder, enter inside models, Stable Diffusion.

- [00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=391) This is the folder where you need to put and paste it there.

- [00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=394) Then return back to downloads, cut the sdxl_vae.safetensors file, move back into fresh installation wherever

- [00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=403) you are installing.

- [00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=404) Move inside models, inside VAE folder and put it there.

- [00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=409) So these are the folders where you need to put your files.

- [00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=412) When you see that running on local URL like this, that means the installation has been

- [00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=420) completed.

- [00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=421) The rest is same for both automatic installer and manual installation.

- [00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=426) So we need to open this URL, copy it, open it in a new window and you will see SDXL base

- [00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=432) model is selected.

- [00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=434) Are we done yet?

- [00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=436) No, we are not done yet.

- [00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=437) We need to set the VAE that it is going to use.

- [00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=441) If you are wondering what is VAE, with Stable Diffusion, we are working in the latent space

- [00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=448) and latent space resolution is 1 over 8 of the generated image.

- [00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=454) So for SD 1.5 version, it is 64 by 64.

- [00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=458) For SDXL, it is 128 by 128, but we are generating 1024 pixel images.

- [00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=468) Therefore, VAE is used to reconstruct latent image into the final output image.

- [00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=475) So how are we going to set our VAE?

- [00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=477) Go to settings, in here go to the user interface, in here go to the info quick setting list.

- [00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=486) When you click here, it will list you all of the options.

- [00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=490) Type VAE and select SDVAE, then apply settings and reload UI.

- [00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=498) After you have reloaded your UI, you will see SD VAE Automatic.

- [00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=503) So what does Automatic means?

- [00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=505) Automatic means that it will look for the VAE same name as this safetensors file.

- [00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=511) When you select none, it will use the embedded VAE file.

- [00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=516) Then you can select the certain VAE from here and we will use this VAE.

- [00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=522) Why?

- [00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=523) As I did put the link here, open it.

- [00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=525) I made a comparison with the SDXL 1.0 embedded VAE and the released VAE, which is the one

- [00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=533) we downloaded.

- [00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=534) You will see the difference.

- [00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=535) With the embedded VAE it generates noise like this.

- [00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=540) You see those green pixels in the image.

- [00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=542) When you look at the downloaded VAE, you won't see them.

- [00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=547) So the embedded VAE has problems.

- [00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=549) That is why Stability AI released this fixed VAE file.

- [00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=554) Now we are fully ready to start using SDXL with Automatic1111 web UI.

- [00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=560) There is also refiner of SDXL, but it is not officially supported with Automatic1111 web

- [00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=567) UI yet.

- [00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=568) It is in the development.

- [00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=569) I am following the news and I will make a new video, hopefully when it is merged into

- [00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=575) main branch.

- [00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=577) So you can type anything.

- [00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=578) Photo of a speed car.

- [00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=582) The SDXL works with 1024 and 1024 pixel resolution don't forget that and you are ready.

- [00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=589) Just hit generate and this is our generated image.

- [00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=593) Now we can begin installing Kohya SS for our training.

- [00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=598) So to be able to use Kohya SS LoRA training script, you need to first have installed Visual

- [00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=606) Studio Redistributable package.

- [00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=608) The link is here.

- [00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=610) Open it and install it.

- [00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=611) After that, we will begin with cloning the Kohya SS.

- [00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=616) This is its repository.

- [00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=617) Let me open it.

- [00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=618) So this is the repository that we are going to clone and run.

- [00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=622) It is very simple to install.

- [00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=624) Copy this, make a new folder and enter inside it.

- [00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=628) Open a new CMD, paste the link.

- [00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=631) It will clone the Kohya SS repository into that folder.

- [00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=635) You will get a folder like this.

- [00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=637) Open inside the folder, find setup.bat file, double click it.

- [00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=642) It will ask you a bunch of questions.

- [00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=644) It is expecting Python 3.10.9.

- [00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=647) However, Python 3.10.11 is also working.

- [00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=650) We are going to select option 1, Kohya SS GUI installation.

- [00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=655) You don't need to install cuDNN files anymore because we are going to install Torch version

- [00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=661) 2 and it comes with the proper cuDNN files.

- [00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=664) Then select option 2 here, Torch version 2.

- [00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=668) This is really important.

- [00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=670) Do not select Torch version 1 anymore.

- [00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=672) This screen may take a while.

- [00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=675) When you open your task manager, go to the performance and when you select your ethernet,

- [00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=681) you will see the download like this.

- [00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=684) Because currently it is downloading and then installing the downloaded libraries.

- [00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=690) You won't see any messages until it completes the current package and moving to the next

- [00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=695) package.

- [00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=696) So this is all you need to do for installation.

- [00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=699) Let's say you have existing Kohya SS installed.

- [00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=704) How can you update it?

- [00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=705) Open a new CMD inside that folder, then type git pull.

- [00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=711) It will fetch the whatever new, then run the gui.bat file and then it will update the necessary

- [00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=718) libraries if there are any and you will have most up to date version of Kohya.

- [00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=723) This is really important because it is getting updated frequently because of the SDXL model.

- [00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=730) So make sure that you have the latest version.

- [00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=734) Recently, one of my Patreon supporters were getting out of VRAM error and it turns out

- [00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=740) that his Kohya installation was not up to date.

- [00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=744) After we updated it to latest version, the out of VRAM error is gone.

- [00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=748) If you ever feel like your installation is stopped, touch your CMD and hit enter.

- [00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=754) Because sometimes when you touch your CMD window, it will freeze.

- [00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=759) So for unfreezing it, touch your CMD and hit enter and you will make the CMD progress continue.

- [00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=766) After a while, when all of the dependencies are installed, you will be asked these options.

- [00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=774) Select this machine, hit enter.

- [00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=776) Select no distributed training, hit enter.

- [00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=779) Do you want to run your training on CPU only?

- [00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=781) No, hit enter.

- [00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=782) Do you wish to optimize your script with Torch Dynamo?

- [00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=787) Hit no, hit enter.

- [00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=789) Type no, hit enter.

- [00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=790) Do you want to use Deep Speed?

- [00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=792) Type no, hit enter.

- [00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=794) What GPUs you want to use?

- [00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=795) Type all, hit enter.

- [00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=797) Now this is important.

- [00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=799) If you have GTX 1000 series, use FP16.

- [00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=806) If you have some special kind of cards, look whether they are supporting BF16 or not.

- [00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=813) If you have RTX 2000 series, 3000 series or 4000 series, select BF16.

- [00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=821) So I am going to select BF16 since I have RTX 3060 and RTX 3090.

- [00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=828) So BF16 selected and we are done.

- [00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=832) So this was all of the installation.

- [00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=835) What if, if you want to install on RunPod or on Unix?

- [00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=840) I have auto installer here for RunPod.

- [00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=843) It should also work with Unix systems.

- [00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=845) You probably only need to change the workspace folder path.

- [00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=851) This is the video where I have shown how to install on RunPod.

- [00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=855) Its readme file is up to date.

- [00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=857) Hopefully, I will make a new video for Kohya installation on RunPod for SDXL LoRA training.

- [00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=864) So after training has been completed, you can close this CMD or start the Kohya SS GUI

- [00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=871) in browser.

- [00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=872) I will show you how to start.

- [00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=874) So let's close this.

- [00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=876) Enter inside where you have installed the Kohya.

- [00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=879) Double click gui.bat file and it will start the gui automatically.

- [00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=885) So let's say you have updated your Kohya installation.

- [00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=889) On this screen, you will see whether any library is updated, upgraded or not.

- [00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=895) So this is my current installation.

- [00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=898) Let's open this link.

- [00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=899) And this is our Kohya GUI LoRA training or DreamBooth training screen.

- [00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=906) It also supports Textual Inversion.

- [00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=908) Hopefully, I will also work on DreamBooth training for SDXL and make amazing video for

- [00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=913) that as well.

- [00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=915) So for today's topic, we are going to do training with LoRA.

- [00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=919) LoRA is optimized version of DreamBooth training.

- [00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=923) If you are wondering what is LoRA training, I have this master tutorial, which is about

- [00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=927) 1 hour.

- [00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=928) Watch this tutorial.

- [00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=930) Also, if you are wondering rare tokens, class images, and all about DreamBooth training,

- [00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=936) this also includes LoRA training somewhat.

- [00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=939) Watch this amazing tutorial.

- [00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=941) You won't regret it.

- [00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=942) So this is our GUI of Kohya LoRA.

- [00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=946) First of all, we will begin with selecting our source model.

- [00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=950) You see there are quick selection of models.

- [00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=952) However, we will use custom model.

- [00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=955) So select custom from here.

- [00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=957) Then it will ask you pre-trained model name or path.

- [00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=960) So click this icon.

- [00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=962) If you are on RunPod, you would be need to give full path.

- [00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=965) But here we can just click this.

- [00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=967) Where we have downloaded our model, it was inside our Automatic1111 web UI.

- [00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=972) So I will enter there, models, Stable Diffusion and SDXL base 1.0 safetensors file.

- [00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=980) So this is the file of my base model where I will do my LoRA training.

- [00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=987) Don't forget to check this checkbox SDXL model.

- [00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=990) Then after doing this, make sure that you have saved your configuration.

- [00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=996) I also shared my configuration in the GitHub.

- [00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=999) When you go to this section, you will find my used settings in this video.

- [00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1005) After downloading it, you can change the extension to JSON.

- [00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1009) Let me show you that.

- [00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1010) So this is the file.

- [00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1011) I will change the extension to JSON.

- [00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1015) Click Yes.

- [00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1016) Now I can load it.

- [00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1017) So let's first load it open into downloads.

- [00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1020) This one and it will load all of the settings I have.

- [00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1024) However, if you do this, you also need to change your image folder path, regularization

- [00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1030) folder path, output folder path, logging folder path, and the model output name if you wish.

- [00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1036) So let's start from zero again.

- [00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1038) OK, so I have selected my base model, selected SDXL.

- [00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1042) I will save my configuration.

- [00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1044) So for saving, click Save as.

- [00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1047) Where I want to save my configuration?

- [00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1049) Let's save it inside this folder.

- [00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1051) You can save it wherever you want.

- [00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1053) I will save it as test1 and click Save.

- [00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1057) And it will generate this file and save whatever the configuration you make.

- [00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1062) After each change don't forget to click Save button for saving.

- [00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1066) And when you do that, you will get the message on the CMD window where your Kohya GUI instance

- [00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1073) is started.

- [00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1074) Whatever we do, we will see it here.

- [00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1076) So we will begin with preparation of the training images.

- [00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1081) This is really important.

- [00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1083) But before that, I noticed that I am using the DreamBooth tab.

- [00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1086) Don't make this mistake.

- [00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1088) We are doing LoRA training.

- [00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1089) So select LoRA tab and let's make the same changes quickly.

- [00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1094) So let's select the model, Stable Diffusion, SDXL base, SDXL model.

- [00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1100) Let's save as so the saving file here, save OK.

- [00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1104) Make sure that you are in LoRA tab.

- [00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1106) And now we can begin with the preparation of training data set.

- [00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1110) Click tools.

- [00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1111) In here you will see deprecated.

- [00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1114) I don't know why they are deprecating it, but this is the best way of preparing your

- [00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1120) training images.

- [00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1122) Otherwise you will likely to make mistakes.

- [00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1125) So the instance prompt will be OHWX.

- [00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1127) However, there is also debate that use a celebrity that is like yourself if you are training

- [00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1135) yourself.

- [00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1136) I will hopefully make a video about that and compare the celebrity name approach versus

- [00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1143) rare token approach.

- [00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1144) But for this video, I will use OHWX.

- [00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1147) The class prompt will be man.

- [00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1149) As I said, if you don't know what are these rare tokens, class token, class images, watch

- [00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1155) this excellent tutorial.

- [00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1157) Okay.

- [00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1158) Training images.

- [00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1159) This is really important.

- [00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1160) Currently, I am using these images and these images are not good, not optimal.

- [00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1167) Why?

- [00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1168) Because they have repeating clothing and repeating background, which makes model to memorize

- [00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1175) those as well.

- [00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1176) Hopefully I will make an amazing how to prepare good training data set tutorial very soon,

- [00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1183) but for now we will use this.

- [00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1185) As I said, this is not a very good training images data set.

- [00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1189) All of the images resolution are same, which are, let me show you right click sort by more

- [00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1195) than select width and height from here.

- [00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1199) Then view details.

- [00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1201) Okay.

- [00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1202) All of the images are 1024 by 1024.

- [00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1206) Kohya scripts are supporting bucketing as well, which means training with different

- [00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1212) resolution images.

- [00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1213) But I suggest you to use same dimension having images for both training images and for classification

- [00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1222) images, because in one of my viewer, I seen that bucketing were causing error and I had

- [00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1229) to connect his computer and try to find out the reason.

- [00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1233) And the reason was he had so many different resolutions and bucketing were failing.

- [00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1238) So these are my training images.

- [00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1239) Copy the path.

- [00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1240) You can select the path from here, control C copy and paste the path here.

- [00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1245) Alternatively, by clicking here, you can select that path.

- [00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1248) For regularization images.

- [00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1251) This is now really debated topic, but I will show you a proof of my approach right now.

- [00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1257) I am using ground truth regularization classification images approach.

- [00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1261) So what is that?

- [00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1262) When you click this link, you will get to this page.

- [00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1266) This page is EveryDream2trainer.

- [00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1269) Every dream trainer is also a trainer script.

- [00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1272) Hopefully I will also make a training with that and compare the results with Kohya and

- [00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1277) the DreamBooth extension of Automatic1111 web UI.

- [00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1280) So in here it is very well explained.

- [00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1283) The ground truth means that the real images originally were used to train the Stable Diffusion.

- [00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1292) So what are they in this case?

- [00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1294) They are real images of people like you are seeing right now.

- [00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1299) These are my classification images.

- [00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1301) I spent huge time to prepare them.

- [00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1305) Those images are shared in this Patreon post.

- [00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1308) You can also prepare your ground truth regularization / classification images.

- [00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1314) Using very high quality real images is the key of ground truth images.

- [00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1319) I have shared so many resolutions of these images.

- [00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1322) They are collected from Unsplash .com so they are freely available to use even for commercial

- [00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1329) purposes.

- [00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1330) All of these ratio having images are shared on my Patreon and from this link you can download

- [00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1337) them.

- [00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1338) So how did I generate these many ratio having perfect quality images?

- [00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1343) When you open these images, you will see them they are in the perfect ratio with the maximum

- [00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1349) possible resolution.

- [00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1351) I have explained the scripts that I used in this tutorial video.

- [00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1357) Watch this tutorial video to learn more about my subject cropping script.

- [00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1362) I shared the script on the video for free.

- [00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1366) You can also download it from my Patreon.

- [00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1368) The script is included in this post as well as with the previously prepared images for

- [00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1375) you.

- [00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1376) They are also not just auto-cropped.

- [00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1378) They are also preprocessed.

- [00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1381) What do I mean by preprocessing?

- [00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1382) When you watch this excellent tutorial video, you will see the preprocessing scripts.

- [00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1387) With preprocessing I have eliminated outlier images from the dataset, which is minimal

- [00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1394) when you use unsplash.

- [00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1395) But still, there are some images that needs to be eliminated.

- [00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1399) For example, if there are 2 person in 1 image, I eliminate that image.

- [00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1405) I deleted or moved it from the folder.

- [00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1408) So we don't have any classification / regularization images that have 2 person in them.

- [00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1416) I also then manually verified all of the images, then shared them with you.

- [00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1421) So it was a huge task for me.

- [00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1423) Therefore, if you support me on Patreon, I would appreciate that very much.

- [00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1427) Still, you can find all of the scripts in these tutorial videos.

- [00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1431) They are YouTube videos, open them, and then you will be able to replicate what I have

- [00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1437) done.

- [00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1438) Since we are doing training with 1024 by 1024 pixel, I will use this dataset, this resolution.

- [00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1445) Let me show you their resolution, right click, details, and you see all of the classification

- [00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1451) images are same resolution.

- [00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1452) If you don't use same resolution classification images, especially in DreamBooth extension

- [00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1458) of Automatic1111 web UI, you will get error.

- [00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1461) It will try to generate new images.

- [00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1464) I don't know what is the behavior of Kohya scripts.

- [00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1467) So make sure that your classification images are same dimension as your training images

- [00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1472) for best results.

- [00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1473) So let's copy this path.

- [00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1475) Let's go over to Kohya GUI, paste it.

- [00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1477) Now number of repeating, which is one of the most confused and debated topic of the Kohya.

- [00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1485) I have asked Kohya repeating logic to the original developer of Kohya.

- [00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1490) Click this link.

- [00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1491) You will see that I have asked four cases and thankfully the Kohya SS replied to my

- [00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1499) questions.

- [00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1500) Moreover, we are discussing how can we improve the repeating logic.

- [00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1505) You can also leave a comment here.

- [00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1507) I hope you do.

- [00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1508) So I am hoping that Kohya will improve his repeating logic.

- [00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1513) So read this thread and you will understand the repeating logic.

- [00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1517) I will use repeating 25.

- [00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1519) So in one epoch, it will train each image 25 times with 25 different regularization

- [00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1527) images.

- [00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1528) How many regularization images you would need, you can easily calculate.

- [00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1532) It is training images multiplied with the number of repeating times.

- [00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1537) So I need total 325 classification images.

- [00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1542) If I had 20 training images, I would need 20 multiplied with 25, 500 classification

- [00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1549) images.

- [00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1550) This is the way how you calculate your number of classification images that you need.

- [00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1556) So the destination training directory, this is where generated LoRA model checkpoints

- [00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1563) and other things will be saved.

- [00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1565) If you want to use them directly with Automatic1111 web UI, you can do this.

- [00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1570) Click this folder icon, enter inside wherever you have installed your Automatic1111 web

- [00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1576) UI, enter inside models, enter inside LoRA and save it there.

- [00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1580) So our generated checkpoints will be saved inside LoRA folder.

- [00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1584) Therefore, we will be able to use generated LoRA checkpoints immediately and very easily.

- [00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1591) After doing this, click, prepare training data.

- [00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1594) Once you clicked, you will see the messages here.

- [00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1598) And when you enter inside that folder, inside LoRA, you will see all of the folders are

- [00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1603) generated like this.

- [00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1605) Make sure that you get this done message because it will copy all of the images inside that

- [00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1612) folder.

- [00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1613) You see all of the class images are copied.

- [00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1615) Then all of the training images are also copied.

- [00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1618) After that, don't forget to click copy info to folders tab.

- [00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1623) Then you are ready.

- [00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1624) You have prepared the training images directories like this.

- [00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1630) And model output name.

- [00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1631) This is important.

- [00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1632) Whatever the model name you give, the files will be saved like that.

- [00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1636) So let's say 12vram.

- [00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1637) This will be my model output name and then click save.

- [00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1641) Don't forget to save your changes.

- [00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1644) Are we ready?

- [00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1645) No.

- [00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1646) Now we need to set training parameters and this is where LoRA training becomes very complex.

- [00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1653) Because there are so many different LoRA types.

- [00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1656) There are so many different optimizers.

- [00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1659) Each one have different effects, different settings and finding optimal settings is very

- [00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1665) hard.

- [00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1666) I have done over 20 trainings and I will share my best training values with you.

- [00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1672) So train batch size.

- [00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1674) Make this 1.

- [00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1676) Why?

- [00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1677) Because in machine learning, if you make the training batch size higher, then you will

- [00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1681) reduce your training generalization.

- [00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1684) Moreover, increased training batch size requires different learning rate.

- [00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1690) So if you increase your training batch size, you need to test increased learning rates

- [00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1695) as well.

- [00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1696) The learning rate will not be same.

- [00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1698) Number of epochs.

- [00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1699) I train persons with up to 200 epochs.

- [00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1703) Since my repeating is 25, I will train 8 epochs.

- [00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1707) Because in 1 epoch, it will train 25 times each training image, which is actually 25

- [00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1714) epochs.

- [00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1715) So the total number of epochs will be 200 with this way.

- [00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1718) I will save every 1 epoch.

- [00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1721) So actually I will be saving every 25 epochs.

- [00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1725) Caption extension.

- [00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1726) If you use captions, you need to define their extension.

- [00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1729) However, for training a person, I don't find captions improving the quality.

- [00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1735) If you were doing fine tuning like 200 subjects.

- [00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1738) Like with 10,000 images, captions would be necessary.

- [00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1742) But for teaching a person, I don't find them useful.

- [00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1746) Hopefully, I will make a fine tuning video and explain the logic to you as well.

- [00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1751) So how you can improve your training quality without using captions?

- [00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1755) You can improve your training data set and it will improve your training quality.

- [00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1760) Make sure that your image is very best quality.

- [00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1763) Don't have repeating patterns such as clothing, such as backgrounds and your training will

- [00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1769) become much better.

- [00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1770) Okay, select cache latents and cache latents to disk.

- [00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1774) These will improve your VRAM.

- [00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1777) Mixed precision will be BF16 since my graphic card is RTX series.

- [00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1783) Save precision will be BF16.

- [00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1785) If BF16 don't work your graphic card, then you need to select FP16.

- [00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1791) You may be wondering what are these?

- [00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1793) This is totally related to machine learning training.

- [00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1797) Normally, each number has certain precision which is by default FP32.

- [00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1802) However, it will use much more VRAM and when you use mixed precision, half precision, the

- [00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1809) quality is almost same.

- [00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1811) So for saving VRAM, we are using mixed precision.

- [00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1815) So BF16, BF16 selected.

- [00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1817) Number of CPU threads per core.

- [00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1820) I increased this but I didn't find much more improvement.

- [00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1824) Actually, there is an amazing file that you can read.

- [00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1828) Find explaining LoRA learning settings and open this link.

- [00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1832) This is a huge file which explains majority of the settings that you will see in Kohya

- [00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1839) training.

- [00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1840) This file is a gold.

- [00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1842) Believe me.

- [00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1843) Read this file and you will learn so many things about how LoRA works, how Stable Diffusion

- [00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1849) works, what are the parameters, options of training.

- [00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1852) Believe me, you won't regret it.

- [00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1855) If you are interested in learning what are these parameters, read this file.

- [00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1860) Okay, seed is optional.

- [00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1861) You don't need.

- [00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1862) Now learning rate.

- [00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1863) This is really important.

- [00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1865) The learning rate depends on your selected LoRA type and your optimizer.

- [00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1870) I am using Adafactor.

- [00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1871) This optimizer is supposed to be lowest VRAM using optimizer.

- [00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1877) How do I know?

- [00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1878) Type Adafactor VRAM usage to Google.

- [00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1880) You will get efficient training on a single GPU thread on Hugging Face.

- [00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1885) And in here search for Adafactor and you will get here.

- [00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1890) It uses a very low amount of VRAM and for getting over the instability issues, we are

- [00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1899) going to use these extra arguments: scale parameter false, relative step false, and

- [00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1906) warm up init false and it becomes stable and it uses minimal amount of VRAM.

- [00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1912) You see AdamW uses 24GB GPU, Adafactor uses 12GB GPU and 8-bit quantization uses 6GB GPU.

- [00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1922) However, 8-bit quantization of DreamBooth training is not supported yet as far as I

- [00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1928) know.

- [00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1929) This is available currently for large language models training.

- [00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1932) So we pick Adafactor.

- [00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1933) We make the learning rate 0.0004 which is equal to actually 4e-4.

- [00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1940) So 4e-4 is scientific notation.

- [00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1942) However, we type it like this: 0.0004.

- [00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1947) Learning rate scheduler I will use constant.

- [00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1950) As I said, read this file to learn more information about all of these options.

- [00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1955) So constant.

- [00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1956) When you use constant learning rate scheduler, this is 0.

- [00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1960) Okay, Adafactor selected.

- [00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1962) Don't touch these two text boxes.

- [00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1964) Optimizer extra arguments.

- [00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1966) This is really important.

- [00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1967) In our readme file, copy these optimizer extra arguments, paste them here like this.

- [00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1973) Max resolution.

- [00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1974) This is also really important for SDXL.

- [00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1977) We are going to use 1024 and 1024.

- [00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1980) We can possibly use higher resolution.

- [00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1984) I will explore that.

- [00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1985) But for 12GB training, you couldn't get higher resolution.

- [00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1990) You should use 1024 and 1024.

- [00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1993) Stop text encoder 0.

- [00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1995) Don't enable buckets.

- [00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=1997) In some cases, when people enabled bucketing, they saw training speed decrease.

- [00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2003) I think bucketing system has some flaws, some bugs.

- [00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2007) Therefore, don't use it.

- [00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2009) And since we are doing training with the same resolution, we don't even need it.

- [00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2013) Text encoder learning rate.

- [00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2015) I use same learning rate for both text encoder and for both UNET.

- [00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2020) As you are seeing right now, I made them equal.

- [00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2023) You can select full BF16 training.

- [00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2025) This is supposed to reduce VRAM usage, but it won't work with all of the optimizers.

- [00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2031) So it is fine to select it.

- [00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2034) Now Network Rank (Dimension).

- [00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2036) This is one of the most crucial part.

- [00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2040) As you increase this, it will be able to learn more details, more information.

- [00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2046) However, it will also increase your VRAM usage and it will take more hard drive space.

- [00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2054) Each one of the checkpoint file will become bigger.

- [00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2057) If you have RTX 3090, 4090, a graphic card that has 24GB, I suggest you to use Network

- [00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2065) Rank (Dimension) 256.

- [00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2067) When you use this dimension, each one of the generated files will be 1.7GB.

- [00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2074) However, for 12GB having GPUs, you will get out of VRAM error.

- [00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2079) I suggest you to start with 32 and you should be able to train with 32.

- [00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2085) If you are not able to train with 32, that means that your other applications are using

- [00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2091) your VRAM.

- [00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2092) How can you reduce them?

- [00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2093) Reduce your screen resolution.

- [00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2096) Right click, open your task manager, go to startup and disable all of the startup applications.

- [00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2104) So do whatever you can do to reduce VRAM usage.

- [00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2109) You shouldn't have more than 500MB VRAM usage when Kohya is not running.

- [00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2114) With that way you will be able to use Network Rank (Dimension) 32 even 64.

- [00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2120) I will do the testing on my second GPU which is RTX 3060 and it has 0 VRAM usage because

- [00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2129) it is my second GPU and I am able to do training with up to 96 network rank.

- [00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2136) However, I tested this on one of my Patreon subscribers computer and he was able to train

- [00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2143) with 32 network dimension on Windows 11.

- [00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2148) So you should be also able to do training with network dimension 32.

- [00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2152) This is generating decent results.

- [00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2155) This is also the network rank dimension I used to generate those images that I have

- [00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2160) shown you in the beginning of the video.

- [00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2163) Network Alpha.

- [00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2165) This is not very well explained anywhere, but this is actually affecting the learning

- [00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2169) rate.

- [00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2170) When you are doing training you are actually changing the weights of the model.

- [00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2177) So network Alpha changes how strongly the learning rate is applied.

- [00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2183) For standard LoRA you should leave the network Alpha value 1.

- [00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2187) But if you use other LoRA types then it changes.

- [00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2191) Okay all these are default advanced configuration.

- [00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2194) In here all you need to do is check Gradient Checkpoint and this is really important otherwise

- [00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2201) you will get out of VRAM error and other than that, you don't need to do anything else.

- [00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2205) Use xFormers is selected.

- [00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2208) You can also select memory efficient attention.

- [00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2210) However, it is not reducing VRAM usage.

- [00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2213) You can also try full FP16 training.

- [00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2215) I tested and it didn't make any difference in terms of VRAM usage.

- [00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2219) So these are all of the settings.

- [00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2221) There is also one more thing.

- [00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2224) No half VAE should be selected for SDXL.

- [00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2228) Some people also asked me how can they continue training at a later time.

- [00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2233) For doing that, you need to check save training state and if you want to continue from previous

- [00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2239) training state, you need to resume from previous training state.

- [00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2244) So in this tutorial, I will show you how to do that.

- [00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2247) I checked save training state.

- [00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2248) I am not generating any samples during the training.

- [00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2253) You will likely to get out of VRAM memory error if you do that, especially on low VRAM

- [00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2259) GPUs.

- [00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2260) So these are all the settings.

- [00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2261) Let's save them and then you can click print training command.

- [00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2265) It won't start training and it will display you all of the settings.

- [00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2269) It will display you how many images it has found.

- [00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2272) This is really important.

- [00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2274) You need to see all of these values correctly.

- [00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2276) So it says found 13 training images and it is going to take 325 steps for each epoch.

- [00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2285) Why?

- [00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2286) Because the repeating number is 25 and it is reading these repeating numbers from the

- [00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2290) folder name.

- [00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2291) Then it says it will use regularization images and regularization images will be also 325

- [00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2298) because the regularization images repeating count is 1 and in each epoch, it will do 325

- [00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2306) steps and in each step it will use 1 regularization / classification image.

- [00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2312) Therefore it will be 325.

- [00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2314) Training batch size 1.

- [00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2316) Gradient accumulation steps 1.

- [00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2317) Do not increase these two unless you have to.

- [00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2320) In which case you may have to?

- [00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2323) If you need faster training then you need to increase.

- [00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2326) However it will reduce your training quality and it will make you to find a more optimal

- [00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2334) learning rate.

- [00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2335) So your learning rate will change if you increase your training batch size or gradient accumulation

- [00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2339) steps.

- [00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2341) Gradient accumulation steps is actually fake training batch size.

- [00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2344) I explained this in previous videos.

- [00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2347) It is not very important right now.

- [00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2349) Hopefully I will make a video about general fine tuning and I will explain all of these

- [00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2354) things in more details.

- [00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2355) So how many epochs we will do training?

- [00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2357) We will do training 8 epoch.

- [00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2359) Then we will compare each one of the generated checkpoints and find the best checkpoint.

- [00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2365) I will show you how to do that.

- [00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2367) Max training steps is calculated like this.

- [00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2370) So in each 1 epoch, it will do 325 steps.

- [00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2374) 1 step means that 1 time GPU execution.

- [00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2379) Why 325?

- [00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2380) 13 images, 25 repeating.

- [00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2384) Then what is this?

- [00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2386) It says that it is divided by 1.

- [00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2388) Why?

- [00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2389) Because our training batch size is 1.

- [00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2391) Then it is divided by 1.0.

- [00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2393) Why?

- [00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2394) Because gradient accumulation steps is 1.0.

- [00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2397) Then it is multiplied with 8.

- [00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2399) Why?

- [00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2400) Because we are going to do training 8 epochs.

- [00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2401) Then it is multiplied with 2.

- [00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2404) Why?

- [00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2405) Because we are using classification images.

- [00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2407) So in each step, it will also do training of classification / regularization images

- [00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2413) which will further fine-tune our model.

- [00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2417) Why?

- [00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2418) Because we are going to use ground truth images.

- [00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2421) What if if you don't have subscription to my Patreon?

- [00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2425) Then you can generate your class images from Automatic1111 web UI.

- [00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2430) So let me start it.

- [00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2431) It is starting my Automatic1111 web UI.

- [00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2434) Okay it is started.

- [00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2436) You see it has taken the next available port because our Kohya GUI is already using this

- [00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2442) port.

- [00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2443) Let's open it.

- [00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2444) Let's say you are going to do training of a woman.

- [00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2447) I don't have regularization images for women yet, but it is on my to-do list and hopefully

- [00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2452) I will release it on my Patreon.

- [00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2455) All you need to do is type photo of a woman.

- [00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2458) Use this prompt usually because you want to get as much as possibly normal images.

- [00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2465) Set your width and height to 1024 and then right click and generate forever.

- [00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2472) Generate as many as you need.

- [00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2474) Here an example image.

- [00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2475) I also made the sampling steps 30, but you see this image is nothing like a real image.

- [00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2481) It is nothing like a real image.

- [00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2484) This is also useful when you want to keep the original style of the model or keep the

- [00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2490) certain style of a model.

- [00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2492) You can also use styled images.

- [00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2494) Whatever you use will further fine-tune model to that style or that quality so it is really

- [00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2501) important.

- [00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2502) And finally, it will list you all of the command like this.

- [00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2505) This is basically generating the command line interface command for you and executing it.

- [00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2511) So the difference of GUI from the original Kohya GUI SS is just this.

- [00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2516) You can also copy this with ctrl c, paste it into a text editor and change every parameter

- [00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2523) you wish.

- [00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2524) For example: some people asked me how they can do train only UNET.

- [00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2529) So this is the --train_unet_only.

- [00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2533) Then append it to the end of the training.

- [00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2536) Prompt copy it.

- [00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2537) Enter inside your Kohya GUI SS folder.

- [00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2540) Enter inside venv virtual environment folder, enter inside scripts, start a new cmd type

- [00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2546) activate.

- [00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2547) After you have activated, paste the command and hit enter and it will start training.

- [00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2552) We will see in a moment.

- [00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2554) It gave me an error.

- [00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2556) Why?

- [00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2557) Because it is looking for this sdxl_train_network.py file.

- [00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2561) However, since it is using relative path, it is not available here.

- [00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2566) So I will move into the main folder like this and I will copy paste the command again.

- [00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2572) Pasted command again.

- [00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2574) Hit enter and now it should work.

- [00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2577) Whenever you get an error, you should look where the error happened.

- [00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2581) Sometimes people are asking me okay, we got another error.

- [00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2584) Okay, it says that sdxl_train is not supporting train UNET only.

- [00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2589) However, it says here that it is supporting so this is definitely a bug.

- [00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2596) But if they fix it later, you can try this.

- [00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2599) Okay, let's close this.

- [00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2600) Let's return back to our GUI instance and start training and we will see that it will

- [00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2607) start training.

- [00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2608) This time it will execute the training, not just display.

- [00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2612) However, this training will happen on my main gpu right now.

- [00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2616) So how you can use it on your second gpu and for demonstration purposes for low VRAM.

- [00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2622) I will now begin to training with second gpu.

- [00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2626) So before closing the existing running cmd window, I will save it.

- [00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2631) Then I will close both of these windows.

- [00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2635) We are going to use set CUDA_VISIBILE_DEVICES argument.

- [00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2638) You can use this pretty much with every application.

- [00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2642) So where we need to add this command?

- [00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2645) We need to add this command into the gui.bat file which is here.

- [00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2649) Right click, click edit and add that line after calling Activate.bat file which is activating

- [00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2658) the virtual environment.

- [00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2660) Save it, then start your GUI.

- [00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2663) Now we will see that it is displaying RTX 3060 on the screen with its available vram

- [00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2671) and other features.

- [00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2672) So let's reload our interface.

- [00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2675) LoRA configuration open.

- [00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2676) We have saved our configuration here.

- [00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2679) Select it, then it will automatically load everything and hit start training.

- [00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2684) And let's look at the vram usage of my RTX 3060.

- [00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2690) since my RTX 3060 is fully empty, not any other application is using I will get the

- [00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2697) best performance and we will see the how much vram it is going to use exactly.

- [00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2703) Okay, it's starting first time.

- [00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2705) It will cache all of the images into the directory as a permanent file since we have selected

- [00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2712) it.

- [00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2713) It will take some time.

- [00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2714) Normally using multiple threads is supposed to increase this speed, but it is not.

- [00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2718) Maybe it is a bug.

- [00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2721) Caching latents is using cpu, however, it is single threaded.

- [00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2725) I think actually it is supposed to follow number of cpu threads per core option we defined

- [00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2732) here, however, it is still using single thread, therefore it is slow.

- [00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2736) I reported this to the Kohya.

- [00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2739) I hope he fixes this because if we had so many images, it would take too much time unnecessarily.

- [00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2746) This caching of images into the disk will be only one time.

- [00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2751) Then it will start training.

- [00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2752) You see it is starting to use more dedicated gpu memory.

- [00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2756) Your shared gpu memory will not be used so don't depend on it.

- [00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2761) With network rank 32, it is using 11.5 gigabyte vram of my gpu and the speed is 2.4 seconds

- [00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2772) per it.

- [00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2773) This is probably the maximum speed that you are going to get currently.

- [00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2778) However, if they improve the script libraries dependencies it may get better.

- [00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2784) But for RTX 3060 currently, this is probably the maximum speed that you are going to get

- [00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2790) and it's a decent speed.

- [00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2792) You see, my training will be completed in 3 hours 30 minutes.

- [00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2796) When you run this script first time, you will see that this duration is decreasing faster

- [00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2802) than it should be because there is some statistics issue.

- [00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2807) So wait like 10 minutes to get the final it per second or the duration of your training.

- [00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2815) Until like 10 minutes it will keep decreasing the time.

- [00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2819) When you check your training folders, you will see these files.

- [00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2823) These files are the cache of the images since we cached the latents in disk as well and

- [00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2829) when I do another training, it won't generate this cached latents again.

- [00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2834) It will use the existing ones.

- [00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2836) Okay, it has reduced to 2.38 seconds per it.

- [00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2840) So this is not the final yet.

- [00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2843) If you get an error like this, image file is truncated that means that one of your training

- [00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2849) or classification image is corrupted.

- [00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2851) This usually happens when you use RunPod or cloud services and upload your images and

- [00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2857) upload is not completed.

- [00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2859) So if you get such error during training, make sure that all of your images are perfectly

- [00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2865) working.

- [00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2866) I have an image validator script on my Patreon.

- [00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2869) You can also use this script to verify all of your images validity.

- [00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2873) The link of image validator script is also shared on the GitHub readme file.

- [00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2878) The training is continuing on.

- [00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2880) Now it is displaying 3 hours, 21 minutes.

- [00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2883) So far 5 minutes passed.

- [00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2885) If you get any error, join our Discord channel.

- [00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2888) The link is here.

- [00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2889) You can also follow me on Twitter from here.

- [00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2891) I have Udemy course as well and if you support me on Patreon I would appreciate that very

- [00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2897) much.

- [00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2898) You can also follow me from LinkedIn and I also have a CivitAI profile as well.

- [00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2904) All of the links are here.

- [00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2905) You will find these links in all of my tutorials.

- [00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2908) I appreciate them if you follow me.

- [00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2911) If you support me.

- [00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2912) It has been almost 10 minutes and it is almost stabilized.

- [00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2917) So you see it is going to take 3 hours 26 minutes for 5200 steps.

- [00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2924) The Kohya added stop training feature as well.

- [00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2927) Let's stop it and let's try with network rank dimension 8.

- [00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2932) If you can't make 32 work, you can reduce your network rank dimension to reduce vram

- [00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2939) usage.

- [00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2940) And let's start training again to see how much vram it will use.

- [00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2943) So you see after I stopped the training it became 0 vram usage.

- [00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2948) Then it will start training again.

- [00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2950) You see it has been frozen the screen.

- [00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2953) I hit enter and it continue.

- [00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2955) Now it's starting.

- [00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2956) You will also get this error caught was no module named triton.

- [00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2962) Because triton optimizer is not available on Windows.

- [00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2966) So you will also get this error.

- [00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2968) Don't worry it is just an optimizer.

- [00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2971) Therefore, we will get a little bit lesser speed, but it will work perfectly fine.

- [00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2977) I hope that the triton developers also release packages for Windows.

- [00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2981) I even opened an issue on their development GitHub.

- [00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2984) You will also see that it is using DreamBooth method even though we are doing LoRA training

- [00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2989) because LoRA is an optimized way of DreamBooth training.

- [00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2994) LoRA is an optimization technique used in machine learning trainings.

- [00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=2998) Okay, this time it won't recache images because it already has the cached images.

- [00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3004) It is starting.

- [00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3006) Let's see how much vram it will use this time.

- [00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3009) You see the vram usage reduced 300 megabytes.

- [00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3011) It was 11.5 gigabytes.

- [00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3012) Now it is 11.2 gigabytes and you see the speed is increasing because we need to wait like

- [00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3022) 10 minutes to see the final speed of training.

- [00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3024) Okay, the vram usage increased to 11.2 gigabytes.

- [00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3028) I think it is stabilized.

- [00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3030) The speed is also getting increased.

- [00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3033) What if if you still can't make it work?

- [00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3036) And what if if your vram usage is too much?

- [00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3039) You will get terrible speeds such as 30 seconds per it if it uses too much vram because it

- [00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3047) will bottleneck the gpu.

- [00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3050) Sometimes you won't get out of vram error.

- [00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3052) It will continue training but it will be too slow.

- [00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3054) This is happening when it uses too much vram.

- [00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3057) Let me demonstrate you.

- [00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3060) So I will stop the training.

- [00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3062) Then I will make the network rank dimension 96.

- [00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3067) Actually let's try 108.

- [00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3070) Okay now it is using 11.8 gigabytes and you see the speed is decreased significantly.

- [00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3077) Now I will further increase the network rank dimension to have more bottleneck of gpu vram.

- [00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3083) Stop training.

- [00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3085) Let's try network rank as 116.

- [00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3087) Okay with 120 network rank dimension now it is taking almost 7 hours.

- [00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3094) So let's say no matter what you do, you are getting out of vram error: make the network

- [00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3101) rank dimension 4.

- [00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3102) This is a really low.

- [00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3104) This will not be very good but if this is what you can do you, you need to do it.

- [00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3110) Then start training.

- [00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3112) Let's see how much vram it will use.

- [00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3115) It is using 11.2 so it is same as 32 rank.

- [00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3120) Therefore find your optimal rank.

- [00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3122) Okay now I will continue network rank 32 dimension full training.

- [00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3127) So it has been over 1 hour and we have saved 2 checkpoints.

- [00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3134) You see we are at the epoch 3.

- [00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3136) You will notice that the epoch 1 the first checkpoint was saved at 650 steps.

- [00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3143) Why?

- [00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3144) Because number of training images multiplied with repeating.

- [00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3148) Then since we have classification images it is 650 steps per epoch.

- [00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3154) And since we are saving every one epoch, the model checkpoints are generated.

- [00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3159) Where they are generated.

- [00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3161) They are generated in the folder where we define it.

- [00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3164) We are also saving state for continuing and each state file is 8 gigabyte.

- [00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3170) I think the saved state file size is independent of what network rank dimension you use.

- [00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3177) The checkpoint files are only 200 megabytes, but each state file is 8 gigabytes.

- [00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3184) So I will not wait until this training is completed because I have done that before.

- [00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3190) I will stop training.

- [00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3191) I will show how you can continue from saved state because it was asked of me.

- [00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3197) So in the Kohya GUI, go to advanced configuration tab which is at the below (now it is at the

- [00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3204) top).

- [00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3205) Then find save training state section and here you will see resume from saved training

- [00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3209) state.

- [00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3210) Click this folder icon, go to the folder where you have saved your training.

- [00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3216) Inside LoRA, inside model.

- [00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3218) Let's continue from state 2 which is generated at the second checkpoint.

- [00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3223) Okay, select folder.

- [00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3225) Now it should continue.

- [00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3227) Let's hit start training and let's see what happens.

- [00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3230) Okay.

- [00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3231) You see cmd windows is frozen so I need to hit enter.

- [00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3234) Okay, now it's continuing.

- [00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3236) Whenever you start a training, it will also generate a unique json file.

- [00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3241) This json file will be saved here as you are seeing.

- [00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3245) So even if you don't save your configuration, you will have saved json file that you can

- [00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3251) load.

- [00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3252) Okay, we should see it is loading the saved state.

- [00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3256) Okay, we can see that resume training from local state and this is the state where it

- [00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3262) is loading and resuming.

- [00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3264) This is how you resume your training with LoRA when you are using Kohya GUI for training.

- [00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3270) So now I will close my Kohya GUI.

- [00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3272) I have previously completed checkpoints here.

- [00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3275) You see: 12 gigabytes settings safetensors file.

- [00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3279) At the end you will also get this 12 gigabytes settings safetensors without any additional

- [00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3285) numbering.

- [00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3286) This is the last file that it will generate.

- [00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3289) Let me move them into new folders.

- [00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3291) So this is our fresh installation.

- [00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3293) Models, LoRA.

- [00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3295) I will just paste them here, even for demonstration.

- [00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3299) I will move them into the model folder where they would be have saved if we had continued

- [00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3305) our training.

- [00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3307) So let's start our Automatic1111 web UI and I will show how to do checkpoint comparison

- [00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3312) and how to use those LoRAs.

- [00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3314) Okay, double click webui-user.bat file.

- [00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3317) The Automatic1111 is starting.

- [00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3321) This is the commit hash that I am using right now.

- [00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3324) These are the web UI arguments that I am using.

- [00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3326) I don't have any extension installed.

- [00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3329) You don't need additional networks extension anymore to use LoRAs with Automatic1111 web

- [00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3334) UI, so don't use it.

- [00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3336) Okay, it is started on this url here.

- [00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3339) Our SD web UI loaded.

- [00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3342) So how you are going to use your trained LoRA?

- [00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3347) When you click this icon, it will open this tab and in here you see Textual Inversion.

- [00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3353) This is another training methodology.

- [00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3355) Hyper Networks.

- [00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3356) This is also another training methodology.

- [00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3358) I have tutorial for Textual Inversion.

- [00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3360) Not Hyper Networks.

- [00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3361) Checkpoints.

- [00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3362) These are our models and LoRA.

- [00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3364) This is where we will pick our LoRA.

- [00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3367) You see it is also displaying the folders inside LoRA folder and it is displaying all

- [00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3372) of the LoRA checkpoints that I have.

- [00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3375) So this 12 gigabyte settings are the LoRAs that I have previously trained and you see

- [00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3380) 12vram.

- [00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3381) This is our first checkpoint from this video training and this is the second checkpoint.

- [00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3387) How we are going to know which checkpoint is best performing?

- [00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3392) So we have trained our face with ohwx man.

- [00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3397) Ohwx is our rare token.

- [00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3399) Man is our class token.

- [00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3401) Let's type photo of ohwx man and nothing else.

- [00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3405) Then we need to add the LoRA checkpoint.

- [00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3407) For adding LoRA checkpoint.

- [00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3409) Either you can type its full name or you can click this icon and then it will append it

- [00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3415) to here.

- [00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3416) Okay after it is appended here, click generate.

- [00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3420) Currently we are using 512 and 512.

- [00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3423) Therefore we will get very bad quality image as you are seeing right now.

- [00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3427) So with SDXL you need to use the native trained resolution or bigger resolution.

- [00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3434) Okay let's hit generate and we got the image.

- [00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3436) It is not very good because of the prompt.

- [00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3439) It is also pretty much memorized the background, the clothing.

- [00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3444) So this is our first attempt to see what we are getting.

- [00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3447) We will make this much better.

- [00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3450) Okay let's try with another checkpoint like this and let's also change the prompt.

- [00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3456) I have shared some prompts here, so let's copy the prompt from our GitHub readme file.

- [00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3463) Let's paste it.

- [00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3464) Okay, this is going to use the seventh checkpoint, then let's copy the negative prompt and let's

- [00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3471) paste it here.

- [00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3472) Let's make the sampling steps 30 and hit generate.

- [00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3476) Okay, it is coming up.

- [00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3477) This is not a cherry pick.

- [00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3479) I will show you how to get very good quality images as well.

- [00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3482) Okay, this is the image.

- [00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3484) Let's generate 10 and then pick the best one to assign a preview for our LoRA.

- [00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3491) How we are going to do that, let's hit generate.

- [00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3493) This will generate 10 images one by one.

- [00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3496) You can see the entire progress here.

- [00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3499) It is 2.88 it per second.

- [00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3502) Why?

- [00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3503) Because I am recording a video right now with Nvidia Broadcast so they are using a lot of

- [00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3509) gpu power.

- [00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3510) Okay, I have got 10 samples and let's see which one is looking decent.

- [00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3514) Okay, let's say this image is looking decent and I want to set this as preview of the seventh

- [00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3521) LoRA file.

- [00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3523) How am I going to do that?

- [00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3524) Let's open the LoRA again and let's go to the seventh checkpoint here.

- [00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3530) Click this icon, replace preview and you see it is replacing preview with the selected

- [00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3536) and save and now this is the preview of my LoRA.

- [00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3540) So how am I going to find the best LoRA checkpoint?

- [00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3544) First of all, you need to decide your prompt.

- [00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3547) This is really crucial.

- [00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3548) For finding the best LoRA I will use this prompt, copy paste it.

- [00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3553) Then I will copy paste negative as well.

- [00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3555) Make sure that you are fixing your LoRA checkpoint naming with yours.

- [00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3560) This is mine so I will delete this.

- [00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3562) Let's go to the LoRAs.

- [00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3564) For example let's start from the first one.

- [00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3566) This is the first LoRA file.

- [00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3569) Moreover, for making it easier, I will do a manual renaming so this is where my LoRAs

- [00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3574) are located.

- [00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3575) The final LoRA is named like this.

- [00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3578) I will make its naming same as the other, so I am renaming it as 8.

- [00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3584) So this is actually the eight checkpoint.

- [00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3586) Then all we need to do is we need to change this number.

- [00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3590) So copy this, go to the x/y/z plot and in here use prompt search and replace.

- [00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3598) So it will look the first string in this string you have written here.

- [01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3603) Then I will replace the values like this.

- [01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3608) So I am going to check each one of the checkpoints as you are seeing right now.

- [01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3614) So it will test all of the 8 checkpoints.

- [01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3618) Make the batch count like 12 so it will generate 12 images for each checkpoint.

- [01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3624) Moreover, CFG 9 is sometimes working better for LoRA training at least for me, but it

- [01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3632) may not be same as you.

- [01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3634) This is the weight of the LoRA.

- [01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3635) If you reduce this, the effect of the LoRA will reduced.

- [01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3639) This is also improving the importance of these two tokens.

- [01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3646) These are our trained rare token and class token.

- [01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3649) Okay, this is all optional.

- [01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3651) This is all related to you.

- [01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3652) You need to find a good prompt as a base and do this checkpoint comparison.

- [01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3659) For LoRAs this is the way.

- [01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3661) Then let's make the grid margins 50 and hit generate.

- [01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3665) We will see the progress here.

- [01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3667) It says that it will generate 96 images on 8 multiplied with 1 grid.

- [01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3673) 12 images per cell.

- [01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3675) Okay, let's just wait now.

- [01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3677) So the x/y/z plot generation has been completed.

- [01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3681) Let's open it from folder, click here.

- [01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3683) It will open text to images folder, go to outputs, go to grids and in here you will

- [01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3690) see the final grid file which is 110 megabytes.

- [01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3694) I will open it with Paint.net and here.

- [01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3698) Now this part is totally subjective and you need to figure out which checkpoint is looking

- [01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3706) best.

- [01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3707) When we consider the first checkpoint, it is certainly under-trained.

- [01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3711) Let's move to the second one.

- [01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3712) This is also looking like under-trained.

- [01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3715) So let's move to the third checkpoint.

- [01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3718) You see this is the third checkpoint.

- [01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3719) It is looking decent.

- [01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3722) Let's move to the next one.

- [01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3723) So this is checkpoint 4.

- [01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3726) It is again looking decent.

- [01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3728) With LoRA training every checkpoint produces very different images.

- [01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3734) This is not the case when you do DreamBooth training, but with LoRA they are very different

- [01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3739) results even though you use same seed values.

- [01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3743) So let's look at the checkpoint 5.

- [01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3746) Okay, this is a really good picture.

- [01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3748) Actually, let's compare with our training data set.

- [01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3751) So the training data set is here.

- [01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3753) And yes, let's open this image.

- [01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3757) Okay, you see this is the LoRA generated image and this is the real image.

- [01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3762) Okay, this is also good.

- [01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3764) Let's look at the checkpoint 6.

- [01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3767) So here we are seeing the checkpoint 6.

- [01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3770) Okay, let's look at the each example.

- [01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3773) You need to find your best checkpoint.

- [01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3776) This is totally subjective as I said, so I can't say that it will be also best for you

- [01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3781) or not.

- [01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3782) And these are the other images.

- [01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3785) Even at the checkpoint.

- [01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3787) Okay, there is something very important.

- [01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3790) At the checkpoint 8.

- [01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3792) We see the overtraining.

- [01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3793) How?

- [01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3794) It even has memorized the background this on the wall.

- [01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3800) Or here it is fully memorized.

- [01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3803) It lost its flexibility even though I define it white suit it is not even completely white.

- [01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3811) This background is also pretty much memorized.

- [01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3814) So checkpoint 8 is definitely over-trained.

- [01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3819) This is clear indication.

- [01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3821) Let me show it from you the training data set.

- [01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3824) You see this is on the wall and it is also here on the wall too.

- [01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3829) Even this detail, yeah, you see, it is completely memorized.

- [01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3833) This is why you should have different backgrounds.

- [01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3837) So we eliminate checkpoint 8.

- [01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3838) In the checkpoint 7.

- [01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3840) Still, it is a little bit memorized.

- [01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3844) It's a decent quality, but still a bit memorized.

- [01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3848) Okay, let's look at the checkpoint 6.

- [01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3851) Yeah, on the checkpoint 6, we don't see such memorization and the results are also very

- [01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3857) decent.

- [01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3858) Still, there is some memorization, but not at that level.

- [01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3863) And on the checkpoint 5, the results are really good.

- [01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3866) So either checkpoint 5 or checkpoint 6 are good.

- [01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3871) We can do another test to see which one is more generalization.

- [01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3876) This is for realism.

- [01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3877) For realism, we can use checkpoint 5 or checkpoint 6, even checkpoint 7 we can use.

- [01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3883) Actually, I used this to generate thousands of images.

- [01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3886) I will show you.

- [01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3887) So another test: what could it be?

- [01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3890) On the GitHub file when you click Stable Diffusion link here, it will open my main repository.

- [01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3896) Please also Star it.

- [01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3898) We have reached over 700 stars.

- [01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3900) It is really important.

- [01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3901) Please also fork it and also watch it.

- [01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3904) If you also become my sponsor I would appreciate that very much.

- [01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3907) In here you will see amazing prompt list for Stable Diffusion.

- [01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3912) I am updating and improving this file.

- [01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3916) Also recently I started to add pictures as well with the prompt.

- [01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3920) So I will test this prompt because it is looking pretty decent.

- [01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3925) When you click this image it will show you the output.

- [01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3928) Let's do another test with this prompt.

- [01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3930) Let's select and copy it.

- [01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3932) This prompt don't have any negatives so let's paste it here.

- [01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3936) Let's delete the existing LoRA and let's delete the negative prompts and hit generate again

- [01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3943) to see what we are coming up with.

- [01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3946) Since x/y/z plot is selected, it will compare each one of the checkpoints.

- [01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3951) Actually, you can remove the first 4 checkpoints to speed up, but for this experimentation

- [01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3958) I will keep it so we will see the difference between each one of the checkpoints.

- [01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3962) By the way, the last generation took about 18 minutes for all of the checkpoints.

- [01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3968) The new test is also completed.

- [01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3971) Let's check out the results so it is also inside the grids.

- [01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3974) Let's open it.

- [01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3976) Okay here, let's re-evaluate.

- [01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3979) So this is the first one.

- [01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3980) Okay second checkpoint, third checkpoint, fourth checkpoint, fifth checkpoint, the sixth.

- [01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3988) It is still pretty amazing.

- [01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3990) Especially this one.

- [01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3991) Okay the seventh.

- [01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3992) Wow.

- [01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3993) The seventh is looking even better I think.

- [01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=3997) Yeah, really, really good, really good.

- [01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4000) And the eighth checkpoint.

- [01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4001) The eighth checkpoint was over-trained so the seventh is also really good.

- [01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4008) So this is how you can evaluate your results and see at which point it is starting to become

- [01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4015) over-trained or not, it is totally up to your taste.

- [01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4019) I find that up to 200 epochs is delivering good results.

- [01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4024) From my past experience as well.

- [01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4027) So yesterday I used this prompt with changing the suit color and generated 2000 plus images.

- [01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4035) You are seeing them right now.

- [01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4037) You see starting from the 0.

- [01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4039) Let's go to the very bottom up to 2471.

- [01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4045) Finding the best images among these too many images is really really hard.

- [01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4050) After looking for a while you will become face insensitive, right?

- [01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4055) Even you won't be able to recognize yourself.

- [01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4058) So what you can do?

- [01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4060) I have an amazing tutorial that will sort your generated images based on a reference

- [01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4067) image.

- [01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4068) The tutorial link is here.

- [01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4069) You can watch it.

- [01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4070) Learn it.

- [01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4071) I have shown the script that I use.

- [01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4074) Alternatively, you can download the script from here from this Patreon post.

- [01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4080) There are also instructions shared in this post as you are seeing.

- [01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4085) So either you can become my Patreon supporter, download it or watch this tutorial to learn.

- [01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4090) This script is very easy to use.

- [01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4093) After you install the requirements, you just give two folders like you are seeing.

- [01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4099) The original folders and the generated images folder.

- [01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4103) Based on your given images it will sort them.

- [01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4106) Now I will show you the results.

- [01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4108) So at first I used this as a base reference image.

- [01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4113) Based on this real image.

- [01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4114) This is from the training images.

- [01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4116) It will sort all of the generated images.

- [01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4119) It doesn't have to be from your training images.

- [01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4121) You can provide any reference image and based on the face similarity the algorithm the AI

- [01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4128) will sort all of the generated images.

- [01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4131) Now let's look at the sorted images.

- [01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4133) So here we are seeing the sorted images results.

- [01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4137) You see they are amazing quality and based on this sorting you can find your best images

- [01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4145) and use them on your Linkedin profile, on your Twitter profile, wherever you need them.

- [01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4152) Can these images be improved?

- [01:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4154) Yes!

- [01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4155) If I had used a better training data set, probably I would be able to get better results.

- [01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4162) Moreover, I find that this tutorial is still better than SDXL for realism.

- [01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4169) However, SDXL is much better for styling than the SD 1.5 based models training.

- [01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4177) I will also explore DreamBooth training of SDXL and I am expecting even much better results

- [01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4185) than what I have obtained with SD 1.5 based workflow.

- [01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4189) So this was the results of first reference image.

- [01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4192) Let me show you the second reference image.

- [01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4195) So this is the second reference image.

- [01:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4196) Based on this second reference image, you can see the new sorting.

- [01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4202) You can give any reference image and based on that reference image, they will get sorted.

- [01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4207) For example, this is the reference image.

- [01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4210) This is the SDXL LoRA generated image.

- [01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4214) I think it can be still further improved and when we have SDXL refiner training I think

- [01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4220) we will get much better results.

- [01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4223) But it is still super similar.

- [01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4225) Super high quality.

- [01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4226) The clothing is very high quality and with even a better data set, I think we can get

- [01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4232) better results.

- [01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4233) I will also explore higher resolution training not 1024 and 1024.

- [01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4240) I will use even higher resolution and test the results.

- [01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4244) So here the third reference image.

- [01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4246) You see I am looking another direction in this image and now when I see the sorted images

- [01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4253) results, you will notice that most of the most similar images are looking at the same

- [01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4258) direction.

- [01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4259) So with this approach, you can find the similar direction looking images.

- [01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4265) It is very convenient to use.

- [01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4267) Moreover, you can put multiple reference images into a single folder and then the script will

- [01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4275) sort them based on the average similarity.

- [01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4278) That is also possible.

- [01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4280) This approach is also possible, so watch this tutorial to learn more and use these scripts

- [01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4286) if you wish.

- [01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4287) If you become my Patreon supporter, I would appreciate that very much because my Youtube

- [01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4292) revenue is very bad and your Patreon support is significantly very important for me.

- [01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4298) You may be wondering the styling capability of the model.

- [01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4302) So in this Patreon post, I shared how to get amazing prompts with ChatGPT for Stable Diffusion.

- [01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4310) Let's download the prompts.

- [01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4312) Okay, let's open it.

- [01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4313) There are some prompts here.

- [01:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4314) You can test all of these prompts, generate images, and then compare them.

- [01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4319) Let me show you the results.

- [01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4321) Okay, here the results of those random prompts totally generated by the ChatGPT.

- [01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4327) There are some very, very interesting and different prompts.

- [01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4331) There was a single prompt.

- [01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4333) I liked very much.

- [01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4335) Let me find it.

- [01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4336) For example, you see they are very, very interesting.

- [01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4339) Okay, let's work on this prompt because I liked it and I will improve the face and show

- [01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4344) you how you can get much better quality.

- [01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4347) Since this is a distance shot you see the face quality is not very good, but we can

- [01:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4352) make it better.

- [01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4353) So to be able to use it I will use png info in the Automatic1111 Web UI.

- [01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4359) Let's drag and drop the image into here.

- [01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4362) Then let's send to text to image tab.

- [01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4366) Don't forget to change your LoRA version accordingly.

- [01:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4370) So let's pick our best LoRA which is like the setting seven, the checkpoint seven.

- [01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4377) Okay.

- [01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4378) Then there is certainm seed.

- [01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4379) However, this was generated with another LoRA so probably we won't get the same result.

- [01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4385) So let's first try whether we're going to get.

- [01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4388) I want to show you the logic of how to fix and improve the image.

- [01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4393) Okay, it is getting somewhat similar, but not similar.

- [01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4396) Okay, I will use the same LoRA to get the same image.

- [01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4400) Or alternatively, let me generate some images and find a decent one so you will see what

- [01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4406) are these settings are capable of.

- [01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4408) I will right click and generate forever until I get a decent one.

- [01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4413) Oh by the way, don't forget to make the seed random.

- [01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4417) So I will cancel, make the seed random and then I will generate again.

- [01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4421) So let's skip this one.

- [01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4423) Right click and generate forever.

- [01:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4425) Okay.

- [01:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4426) Okay the images are being generated.

- [01:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4427) For example this one.

- [01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4429) It is looking decent or this one.

- [01:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4431) We can improve this one significantly.

- [01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4433) It is also looking very cool.

- [01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4435) Okay, this one is also really looking well.

- [01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4438) Yeah except it has some missing parts.

- [01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4440) Okay here another image which can be improved.

- [01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4443) This one is also pretty cool.

- [01:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4446) Okay here another one.

- [01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4448) You see, SDXL is extremely flexible.

- [01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4451) It generates this realism then this styling with the same prompt or this realism.

- [01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4457) This is also realistic image.

- [01:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4460) It is so capable of outputting very different concepts.

- [01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4465) Very different art styles with the same prompt.

- [01:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4467) Okay, you see this is also like dragon merged with a horse.

- [01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4472) Okay let's try to improve this one.

- [01:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4474) I won't wait too much.

- [01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4475) This is just to show you the logic.

- [01:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4478) So let's just cancel generate forever, then go to the png info.

- [01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4483) Delete the older one.

- [01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4485) Let's drag and drop the image, send text to image tab.

- [01:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4489) Now we need to test high resolution fix until we get errors.

- [01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4496) What I mean by that?

- [01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4497) So for example let's upscale with 50 percent, make the denoising strength 50 percent and

- [01:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4504) then hit generate.

- [01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4505) When you start getting repeating issue, then that is the point where you need to stop.

- [01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4512) Until getting that repeating issue you need to try bigger resolution with upscale by percentage.

- [01:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4519) Okay with 50 upscale there is no noticeable repeating problem so let's try 60 percent.

- [01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4528) I will increase it to 60.

- [01:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4529) Generate.

- [01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4530) Okay, the image has been generated.

- [01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4533) Let's look at it.

- [01:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4534) Okay still can we say?

- [01:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4536) Yeah we are starting to see some deforming here and here it doesn't exist or not very

- [01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4544) noticeable.

- [01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4545) So let's use this 1.5 which is 50% increment.

- [01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4551) What are we going to do is as a next?

- [01:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4553) Let's go to the png info.

- [01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4556) Delete, load the image.

- [01:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4558) Send it to the inpainting.

- [01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4560) Okay, the same settings are loaded.

- [01:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4563) What we need to fix is let's first fix the hand because it is not looking very good.

- [01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4569) So I will just mask it like this.

- [01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4572) Select only masked from here.

- [01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4575) Let's do not change anything else and try like this.

- [01:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4579) A hand of a male.

- [01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4582) Okay and let's generate.

- [01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4584) By the way it will only in paint the masked, inpaint masked, original, only masked padding

- [01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4591) pixels 32.

- [01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4592) You can also increase this and try different values.

- [01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4595) You can also increase denoising strength to see the effect.

- [01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4599) All right, let's look at the results.

- [01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4601) So click this icon.

- [01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4603) It will open the image to images folder and when we look from zooming in, this is the

- [01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4610) image.

- [01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4611) It is not looking very good.

- [01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4612) Also, the tone is not very much matching.

- [01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4615) So what can we do to fix this?

- [01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4618) First of all make the seed minus one.

- [01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4620) So every time we will get a different result.

- [01:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4623) We can zoom in and try to mask it more carefully.

- [01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4628) When you hover your mouse here it will show you the options.

- [01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4631) You see.

- [01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4632) So while I am holding my alt key, I am zooming in.

- [01:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4636) While I am holding my control, I am able to make the masking area smaller so let's mask

- [01:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4643) it a little bit more detailed.

- [01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4646) Okay, like this.

- [01:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4648) Maybe like this.

- [01:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4650) Allright.

- [01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4651) Let's also fix the error in our prompt.

- [01:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4653) While holding f you can move the canvas.

- [01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4657) Okay, I think we need to be on the canvas section.

- [01:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4660) Yeah, now working.

- [01:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4662) All right.

- [01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4663) We have 50% denoise 32 pixels paddings.

- [01:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4668) Let's try several more times until we get a decent result.

- [01:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4672) During the generation, it will show you the zoomed in generated area like this.

- [01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4678) Okay, after several tries, I got a very decent image.

- [01:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4683) As you are seeing right now, there is still some toning mismatch, but when you look from

- [01:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4688) the distance it won't be very much visible.

- [01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4691) This is the logic.

- [01:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4692) This can be perfected.

- [01:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4694) So I changed the prompt: ohwx man holding bike arm.

- [01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4698) You see, I defined it more carefully.

- [01:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4701) Then we need to send this image to the inpaint again so the image here will get updated.

- [01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4707) Also, click this to update it.

- [01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4709) Then we need to use the original prompt we used generate this image to fix the face.

- [01:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4716) So the original prompt was this.

- [01:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4718) Now let's zoom in and mask the face so I will make the masking bigger.

- [01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4724) Let's mask it like this.

- [01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4725) There are also automatic masking and automatically generating in-painted face extension called

- [01:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4733) as adetailer.

- [01:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4734) Hopefully I will make a tutorial about that as well, but not in this one.

- [01:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4739) All right, let's try again.

- [01:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4741) Okay, even at the first try we got a decent image.

- [01:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4746) Now all you need to do is try several times until you get a decent image, until you are

- [01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4751) satisfied with the result.

- [01:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4753) You see even at the first result, I got a decent image.

- [01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4756) This is how you can improve distant shots generated images of yourself.

- [01:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4763) Previously we had to use this Kohya developed sd web UI additional networks extension, but

- [01:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4771) you don't need to use it anymore.

- [01:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4772) Now Automatic1111 web UI is supporting all of the LoRA types automatically, which is

- [01:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4778) great.

- [01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4779) I added that Patreon post link to here which I explained how to get amazing prompts for

- [01:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4787) testing.

- [01:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4788) It is here.

- [01:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4789) So let's say you want to use same training command that I used.

- [01:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4793) It is shared here.

- [01:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4794) Copy it, then paste it into any text editor.

- [01:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4798) Then you need to change your folder paths.

- [01:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4801) Make sure that these folder paths are properly prepared in your case, otherwise it won't

- [01:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4808) work.

- [01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4809) After you have done this all you need to do is just copy it, activate the Kohya virtual

- [01:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4815) environment, and execute it as I have shown in the beginning of the video.

- [01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4821) I also have some other prompts here you can play with them.

- [01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4825) You see in some cases you need to reduce the weight of the rare token.

- [01:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4830) Let's try this for example.

- [01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4832) Let's copy it.

- [01:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4833) There are no negatives for GTA 5.

- [01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4836) Okay, let's paste it.

- [01:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4838) Let's disable high resolution fix, make the seed random, delete the negatives, and let's

- [01:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4844) generate 12 images.

- [01:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4845) Okay, here we got the results.

- [01:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4847) Not all of them are very good.

- [01:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4849) Like this.

- [01:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4850) This is decent.

- [01:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4851) This is decent as you are seeing right now.

- [01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4854) This is not related.

- [01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4856) I like this one.

- [01:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4857) Okay, this one is also decent.

- [01:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4859) This is also very decent one.

- [01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4862) Let's increase CFG to 9 and try again.

- [01:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4865) Okay, here we got the CFG 9 results.

- [01:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4868) Okay, as we are seeing right now, they are decent, but not very good.

- [01:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4874) Okay.

- [01:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4875) Okay, this one is decent.

- [01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4876) It is following face strictly but not very stylized.

- [01:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4881) Maybe we can do reduce the weight of the LoRA so it will follow more.

- [01:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4890) Like this.

- [01:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4891) Let's also remove the weighting here and try again.

- [01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4895) This styling capability totally depends on your training data set, your used checkpoint,

- [01:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4900) and the weight of the LoRA.

- [01:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4903) If it doesn't get styled enough, try to reduce the LoRA weight and especially try to improve

- [01:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4910) your training data set differentiation.

- [01:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4914) As I said, use different backgrounds, different clothing, and use very high quality images

- [01:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4920) in your training data set.

- [01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4922) Okay here the results.

- [01:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4923) When we give 90 percent weight to the LoRA.

- [01:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4927) This one, this one, this one, this one decent, this one, this one, this one, this one, this

- [01:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4936) one not very related, this one and this one and this one.

- [01:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4941) So you see you can even further reduce and try again.

- [01:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4945) These are not cherry picking.

- [01:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4947) You know with Stable Diffusion it is numbers game.

- [01:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4950) You need to generate a lot of images to get the perfect image that you are looking for.

- [01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4956) That is why my similarity script is very important and very useful.

- [01:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4960) And we got results for 80 percent.

- [01:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4963) Okay, let's look at them.

- [01:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4965) Yeah, it is becoming more and more gta5 style so you need to find a sweet spot between your

- [01:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4974) likeliness and your styling.

- [01:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4976) And here the results.

- [01:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4978) It generates one black and white.

- [01:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4979) I don't know why, but the results are decent.

- [01:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4982) This is not very like me, but you see it becomes more like gta5, especially maybe this one.

- [01:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=4988) Thank you for watching.

- [01:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=5067) If something gets changed, I will update possibly these two sections.

- [01:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=5073) These extra arguments are important.

- [01:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFGitIvD2A&t=5075) This is for Adafactor.
