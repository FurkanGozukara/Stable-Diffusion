- [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xLqDTVWUSec&t=0) I beat China all the time. When was the last&nbsp; time you saw a Chevrolet in Tokyo? Now he's&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xLqDTVWUSec&t=7) acting like he wants to debate me again. Well,&nbsp; make my day, pal. I beat China all the time. When&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xLqDTVWUSec&t=13) was the last time you saw a Chevrolet in Tokyo?&nbsp; When do we beat Mexico at the border? They're&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xLqDTVWUSec&t=20) laughing at us. They're bringing drugs. They're&nbsp; bringing crime. They're rapists. The big lie,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xLqDTVWUSec&t=26) Obamacare. Donald Trump lost two debates to me in&nbsp; 2020. Since then he hadn't shown up for debate.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xLqDTVWUSec&t=31) Now he's acting like he wants to debate me again.&nbsp; Well, make my day, pal. I'll even do it twice. So&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xLqDTVWUSec&t=38) let's pick the dates, Donald. I hear you're free&nbsp; on Wednesdays. Greetings everyone. Today I am&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xLqDTVWUSec&t=42) going to show you how to use this amazing open&nbsp; source application, Tencent AI Lab V-Express on&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xLqDTVWUSec&t=49) Windows. I have prepared this amazing Gradio&nbsp; application for this open source application.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xLqDTVWUSec&t=54) It is in development. You see the last commit was&nbsp; yesterday. It is getting better and better every&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xLqDTVWUSec&t=60) day. And also I am adding new features to my own&nbsp; Gradio application. This application works on both&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xLqDTVWUSec&t=67) Windows on Massed Compute, on RunPod and maybe on&nbsp; Kaggle. Kaggle is not ready yet, but the Massed&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xLqDTVWUSec&t=73) Compute, RunPod, and Windows one-click installers&nbsp; are ready. So today I am going to show you how&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xLqDTVWUSec&t=79) to one-click install and use this application on&nbsp; your computer. It supports bigger than 512 to 512&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xLqDTVWUSec&t=86) resolution videos as well. So it is a very, very&nbsp; amazing application. This is the best static image&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xLqDTVWUSec&t=92) into the talking avatar application so far we&nbsp; have. Moreover, this application works with audio&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xLqDTVWUSec&t=99) input as well. So you don't need a video input&nbsp; to generate talking avatars. It supports both&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xLqDTVWUSec&t=105) audio input and also video driving input. When&nbsp; you use a driving video input, it tries to also&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xLqDTVWUSec&t=112) match the talking of the video input as well.&nbsp; However, you don't need a video. It also works&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xLqDTVWUSec&t=117) with only audio as well. So how we are going&nbsp; to install V-Express. In this post, everything&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xLqDTVWUSec&t=124) you need is explained step by step. Let's go to&nbsp; the bottom and in the bottom, you will see this&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xLqDTVWUSec&t=129) attachment. Download both of the V-Express zip&nbsp; files. And if you want to use the demo images,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xLqDTVWUSec&t=135) let's also download it. Move both of the files&nbsp; wherever you want to install. While making a folder&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xLqDTVWUSec&t=141) name do not use space characters. So do not make&nbsp; it like image to AI like this. You see this has a&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xLqDTVWUSec&t=148) space character and in some libraries, the paths&nbsp; are not being handled accurately. Therefore, it&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xLqDTVWUSec&t=155) is best to use image_to_AI. You see, I have used&nbsp; this underscore instead of the space character.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xLqDTVWUSec&t=162) Then let's paste the zip files. Let's extract the&nbsp; zip files. OK, like this right click, extract. And&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xLqDTVWUSec&t=169) this is the folder where the files are put. You&nbsp; see, we already have Massed Compute and RunPod&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xLqDTVWUSec&t=175) installers. Hopefully, I will also make a Kaggle&nbsp; and I will make another tutorial to show you how&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xLqDTVWUSec&t=181) to install on those platforms. But today we are&nbsp; going to install for Windows. So all you need to&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xLqDTVWUSec&t=186) do is just double-click this windows_install.bat&nbsp; file. It will install this application into a&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xLqDTVWUSec&t=194) virtual environment folder so it will not conflict&nbsp; with any other application that you have. It will&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xLqDTVWUSec&t=201) be totally isolated. And meanwhile, installation&nbsp; is continuing. You see, it is generating virtual&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xLqDTVWUSec&t=206) environment 3.10, which requirements you need.&nbsp; You need to have Python 3.10.11. This works best.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xLqDTVWUSec&t=213) It works with Automatic1111 Web UI, ComfyUI,&nbsp; Kohya, OneTrainer. This is the best version.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xLqDTVWUSec&t=219) You need Git, FFmpeg, CUDA 11.8. This is super&nbsp; important because InsightFace and ONNX runtime&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xLqDTVWUSec&t=228) require 11.8 and C++ tools. So how you can check&nbsp; them out? Open a CMD like this and type Python&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xLqDTVWUSec&t=236) and you should get 3.10.11. If you have multiple&nbsp; Python versions, it will still work as long as you&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xLqDTVWUSec&t=242) have 3.10.11. How do you check the Git? Just type&nbsp; Git and you have the Git. How do you check FFmpeg?

- [00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xLqDTVWUSec&t=248) Just type FFmpeg and you see FFmpeg installed.&nbsp; And how do you check CUDA? Just type nvcc --version&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xLqDTVWUSec&t=257) and it is done. Unfortunately, there is no&nbsp; easy way to check C++ tools. Don't worry,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xLqDTVWUSec&t=263) I have a tutorial that shows how to install all&nbsp; of these step by step. Once you install this,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xLqDTVWUSec&t=269) you will be able to run all of the open&nbsp; source AI applications. So it is very,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xLqDTVWUSec&t=275) very good investment to watch this tutorial and&nbsp; install everything. This is a public tutorial. The&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xLqDTVWUSec&t=281) link will be in the description of this video as&nbsp; well. So even if you are not my Patreon supporter,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xLqDTVWUSec&t=286) you can still watch and follow this tutorial&nbsp; to install all of this. And when we are inside&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xLqDTVWUSec&t=291) the generated folder, we can see the virtual&nbsp; environment folder here. So everything will be&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xLqDTVWUSec&t=295) installed inside here. If you want to uninstall&nbsp; my installer, just delete this and it will be&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xLqDTVWUSec&t=301) uninstalled. You see it is installing InsightFace.&nbsp; This will fail if you don't install C++ tools. So&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xLqDTVWUSec&t=309) it is super important to install C++ tools. And&nbsp; you see it is getting installed because I already&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xLqDTVWUSec&t=315) have C++ tools installed. This installer is also&nbsp; going to download some of the models. You see&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xLqDTVWUSec&t=321) currently it is downloading. So depending on your&nbsp; internet speed, the installation may take a while.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xLqDTVWUSec&t=328) Just patiently wait. And finally, installation has&nbsp; been completed. Do not just close this window yet,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xLqDTVWUSec&t=334) because if there is an error, you need to&nbsp; send me the entire log of installation. So&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xLqDTVWUSec&t=340) right-click the top of the CMD window and from&nbsp; here, edit, select all, then right-click, edit,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xLqDTVWUSec&t=349) copy, then open a notepad file, save it anywhere&nbsp; you want. And then send me that log, for example,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xLqDTVWUSec&t=356) logs. And that's it. Then you can send me this&nbsp; file. If there is an error, you don't need to&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xLqDTVWUSec&t=360) send me. However, let's say there is an error. You&nbsp; can send me. OK, so now we are ready to use. How we&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xLqDTVWUSec&t=366) are going to use it. You just need to double-click&nbsp; the Windows start.bat file and it will start the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xLqDTVWUSec&t=372) application. Moreover, I have made some comparison&nbsp; tests. They are inside this zip file. Just&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xLqDTVWUSec&t=377) download it and inside it, you will see test files&nbsp; and their configuration so you can look at them&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xLqDTVWUSec&t=383) to see which configuration is making what kind&nbsp; of differences. So how are we going to use this&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xLqDTVWUSec&t=388) application, it is pretty straightforward. You&nbsp; just need to upload your static image as an input.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xLqDTVWUSec&t=394) You see, these are demo images and videos that&nbsp; we have downloaded like this. Then you can either&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xLqDTVWUSec&t=399) drop an audio file or video file. All of the&nbsp; formats are supported. Let's try with a video file&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xLqDTVWUSec&t=407) like this. When you upload a video file, there&nbsp; are two options you see retarget strategy. If you&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xLqDTVWUSec&t=413) use fix face, it will not use the driving&nbsp; video. So it will use only the audio of this&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xLqDTVWUSec&t=419) video file. However, if you want to also use the&nbsp; driving video as a face movement, it is best to&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xLqDTVWUSec&t=426) use offset retarget. There is also a description.&nbsp; This is a description from the official authors of&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xLqDTVWUSec&t=431) the model. So you can also try no retarget if they&nbsp; are the same person or you can try naive retarget.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xLqDTVWUSec&t=439) However, I didn't find that naive retarget working&nbsp; better for me. But with your example case, it may&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xLqDTVWUSec&t=445) work. Then there is target video height and video&nbsp; width. How much VRAM this application is going to&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xLqDTVWUSec&t=450) use totally depends on your target video width&nbsp; and target video height and also the duration of&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xLqDTVWUSec&t=456) your target input. So as you put a longer video or&nbsp; audio file here, it will use more VRAM. It is not&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xLqDTVWUSec&t=463) like slicing and generating. It is generating as&nbsp; a whole right now. So it will use more VRAM. But&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xLqDTVWUSec&t=469) don't worry, I am going to make a Massed Compute tutorial and there is a 48 GB GPU. So you will be&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xLqDTVWUSec&t=476) able to generate very long videos in the Massed Compute if your computer is not strong enough. So&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xLqDTVWUSec&t=482) these are the default settings. There is also a&nbsp; reference attention weight, audio attention&nbsp;

- [00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xLqDTVWUSec&t=485) weight. You can see the description here. Just&nbsp; read it. And there is face focus expansion&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xLqDTVWUSec&t=491) percent. Now let me show you what does this do.&nbsp; For example, let's try 50 percent and let's crop&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xLqDTVWUSec&t=497) this image. This image will be cropped according&nbsp; to the crop width and crop height as you are&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xLqDTVWUSec&t=502) seeing here. And it will crop the face and it will&nbsp; expand it with the percentage. According to the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xLqDTVWUSec&t=509) authors, you should really use a focused face&nbsp; so you see it is focused. So you can try this&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xLqDTVWUSec&t=515) as a 0 percent crop your image. You don't need&nbsp; to click crop because when you enable auto crop,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xLqDTVWUSec&t=520) it will automatically crop your image&nbsp; and try to animate your image like this.

- [00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xLqDTVWUSec&t=525) It will work better. As I said, just try&nbsp; and see how it is working. For example,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xLqDTVWUSec&t=531) this is 512 to 512. OK, we are ready. If you don't&nbsp; enable auto crop, it will use your input image as&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xLqDTVWUSec&t=538) it is. So make sure that your image is accurately&nbsp; cropped and with the accurate dimensions and&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xLqDTVWUSec&t=544) resolutions. So how much VRAM we are going to use&nbsp; with these settings? You see currently I am&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xLqDTVWUSec&t=549) using 7.6 gigabytes. So let's generate&nbsp; the video and see how much time it is going to&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xLqDTVWUSec&t=556) take and how many frames this input is. You can&nbsp; watch the status in the CMD window. You see how&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xLqDTVWUSec&t=562) faster it is to find the face in the input video.&nbsp; Why? Because it is finding the face in the every&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xLqDTVWUSec&t=570) frame of the input video with the CUDA enabled&nbsp; ONNX InsightFace. So this video is 53 frames.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xLqDTVWUSec&t=580) Therefore, this is the length of our video. If&nbsp; it is 30 FPS, it is around two seconds. And let's&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xLqDTVWUSec&t=586) see how much VRAM we will use. OK, all right. It is&nbsp; starting. It's also displaying the parameters&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xLqDTVWUSec&t=592) and it is started. So it is using this much VRAM.&nbsp; Let's calculate it. So it is using around

- [00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xLqDTVWUSec&t=598) 9 gigabytes VRAM right now. If I make this a lower&nbsp; duration, like 30 frames, it will use lesser. If I&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xLqDTVWUSec&t=606) make it like 100 frames, it will use more. If&nbsp; I make this target video width and height more,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xLqDTVWUSec&t=612) it will use more. So this is how it is working.&nbsp; Don't worry. I'm also hopefully going to make a&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xLqDTVWUSec&t=617) Kaggle notebook for this. So if you don't have&nbsp; a GPU and if you don't want to pay to the cloud&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xLqDTVWUSec&t=621) providers, you will be able to use this on Kaggle&nbsp; for free. And we got the output. You see, it took&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xLqDTVWUSec&t=628) around three minutes to generate this output&nbsp; on RTX 3090. Depending on your GPU, it will be&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xLqDTVWUSec&t=634) shorter or longer. So let's play the input video&nbsp; and then the output video. I beat China all the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xLqDTVWUSec&t=641) time. I beat China all the time. I beat China all&nbsp; the time. I beat China all the time. So instead&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xLqDTVWUSec&t=648) of offset retarget, if I use fix face, it will&nbsp; just generate the static head just talking. You&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xLqDTVWUSec&t=655) can also generate higher resolution as I said.&nbsp; Every generated video will be automatically saved&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xLqDTVWUSec&t=661) inside outputs folder. Let's open the folder and&nbsp; you see it is named it as like this because it&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xLqDTVWUSec&t=667) is using the input image name and then appending&nbsp; the number. Also, cropped images will be saved&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xLqDTVWUSec&t=673) here. For cropped images to be saved you need&nbsp; to click crop image. You can also crop them with&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xLqDTVWUSec&t=678) different resolution. Let's try crop width 512 and&nbsp; crop height 768. Click crop image. These two options&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xLqDTVWUSec&t=686) are different. This one is for target video and&nbsp; this one is for cropping the image. You see,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xLqDTVWUSec&t=691) it is perfectly cropped with the 512 to 768. When&nbsp; I open this image, you will see that it is exactly&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xLqDTVWUSec&t=699) as 512 to 768. If you need code of this, you can&nbsp; install it and then look at the code because it&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xLqDTVWUSec&t=706) is there. It is not like hidden. This crop width&nbsp; and this crop height is not the same as here. So&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xLqDTVWUSec&t=711) you need to set them both the same if you want&nbsp; it or you can set them different as well. And&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xLqDTVWUSec&t=716) you can generate different resolution videos. After&nbsp; installation I suggest you run it as a default to&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xLqDTVWUSec&t=723) make sure that it is working. First of all, try&nbsp; with our example video input example video image.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xLqDTVWUSec&t=730) Then once you verify it is working, you can try&nbsp; your different things. So that's it. Hopefully,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xLqDTVWUSec&t=735) I'm going to make another tutorial to show you how&nbsp; to use this on cloud services if you don't have&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xLqDTVWUSec&t=740) a GPU, if you have a Mac computer. Moreover, I&nbsp; strongly suggest you to join our Discord channel.&nbsp;&nbsp;
