### Video Transcription


- [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1UvUjTaJRz0&t=0) Looking ahead, making AI helpful for everyone is&nbsp; the most profound way we will advance our mission.&nbsp;

- [00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1UvUjTaJRz0&t=8) We are doing this in four important ways.&nbsp;

- [00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1UvUjTaJRz0&t=11) First, by improving your knowledge and learning&nbsp; and deepening your understanding of the world.&nbsp;

- [00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1UvUjTaJRz0&t=17) Second, by boosting creativity and productivity&nbsp; so you can express yourself and get things done.&nbsp;

- [00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1UvUjTaJRz0&t=24) Third, by enabling developers&nbsp; and businesses to build their&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1UvUjTaJRz0&t=27) own transformative products and services. And finally, by building and deploying AI&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1UvUjTaJRz0&t=33) responsibly so that everyone can benefit equally. We are so excited by the opportunities ahead.&nbsp;

- [00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1UvUjTaJRz0&t=40) Our ability to make AI helpful for everyone relies&nbsp; on continuously advancing our foundation models.&nbsp;

- [00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1UvUjTaJRz0&t=49) So I want to take a moment to&nbsp; share how we are approaching them.&nbsp;

- [00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1UvUjTaJRz0&t=54) Last year, you heard us talk about Palm, which&nbsp; led to many improvements across our products.&nbsp;

- [00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1UvUjTaJRz0&t=60) Today, we are ready to announce our&nbsp; latest Palm model in production,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1UvUjTaJRz0&t=65) Palm 2. Palm&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1UvUjTaJRz0&t=73) 2 builds on our fundamental research&nbsp; and our latest infrastructure.&nbsp;

- [00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1UvUjTaJRz0&t=78) It's highly capable at a wide&nbsp; range of tasks and easy to deploy.&nbsp;

- [00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1UvUjTaJRz0&t=84) We are announcing over 25 products&nbsp; and features powered by Palm 2 today.&nbsp;

- [00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1UvUjTaJRz0&t=89) Palm 2 models deliver excellent foundational&nbsp; capabilities across a wide range of sizes.&nbsp;

- [00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1UvUjTaJRz0&t=95) We have affectionately named them&nbsp; Gecko, Otter, Bison and Unicorn.&nbsp;

- [00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1UvUjTaJRz0&t=102) Gecko is so lightweight that&nbsp; it can work on mobile devices.&nbsp;

- [00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1UvUjTaJRz0&t=107) Fast enough for great interactive&nbsp; applications on device, even when offline.&nbsp;

- [00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1UvUjTaJRz0&t=113) Palm 2 models are stronger in logic and reasoning,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1UvUjTaJRz0&t=116) thanks to broad training on&nbsp; scientific and mathematical topics.&nbsp;

- [00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1UvUjTaJRz0&t=121) It's also trained on multilingual&nbsp; text spanning over 100 languages,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1UvUjTaJRz0&t=126) so it understands and generates nuanced results. Combined with powerful coding capabilities,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1UvUjTaJRz0&t=133) Palm 2 can also help developers&nbsp; collaborating around the world.&nbsp;

- [00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1UvUjTaJRz0&t=137) Let's look at this example. Let's say you're working with a&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1UvUjTaJRz0&t=141) colleague in Seoul and you're debugging code. You can ask it to fix a bug and help out your&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1UvUjTaJRz0&t=148) teammate by adding comments in Korean to the code. It first recognizes the code is recursive,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1UvUjTaJRz0&t=155) suggests effects, and even explains&nbsp; the reasoning behind effects.&nbsp;

- [00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1UvUjTaJRz0&t=160) And as you can see, it added comments&nbsp; in Korean, just like you asked.&nbsp;

- [00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1UvUjTaJRz0&t=171) While Palm 2 is highly capable, it really shines&nbsp; when fine-tuned on domain-specific knowledge.&nbsp;

- [00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1UvUjTaJRz0&t=179) We recently released SecPalm, a version of&nbsp; Palm 2 fine-tuned for security use cases.&nbsp;

- [00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1UvUjTaJRz0&t=185) It uses AI to better detect malicious&nbsp; scripts and can help security experts&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1UvUjTaJRz0&t=191) understand and resolve threats. Another example is MedPalm 2.&nbsp;

- [00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1UvUjTaJRz0&t=196) In this case, it's fine-tuned&nbsp; on medical knowledge.&nbsp;

- [00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1UvUjTaJRz0&t=199) This fine-tuning achieved a 9x reduction in&nbsp; inaccurate reasoning when compared to the model.&nbsp;

- [00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1UvUjTaJRz0&t=206) Approaching the performance of clinician&nbsp; experts who answered the same set of questions.&nbsp;

- [00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1UvUjTaJRz0&t=212) In fact, MedPalm 2 was the first language&nbsp; model to perform at expert level on medical&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1UvUjTaJRz0&t=218) licensing exam-style questions and&nbsp; is currently the state of the art.&nbsp;

- [00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1UvUjTaJRz0&t=223) We are also working to add capabilities to MedPalm&nbsp; 2 so that it can synthesize information from&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1UvUjTaJRz0&t=229) medical imaging like plain films and mammograms. You can imagine an AI collaborator that helps&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1UvUjTaJRz0&t=236) radiologists interpret images&nbsp; and communicate the results.&nbsp;

- [00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1UvUjTaJRz0&t=241) These are some examples of Palm 2&nbsp; being used in specialized domains.&nbsp;

- [00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1UvUjTaJRz0&t=245) We can't wait to see it used in more. That's why I'm pleased to announce that&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1UvUjTaJRz0&t=250) it is now available in preview&nbsp; and I'll let Thomas share more.&nbsp;

- [00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1UvUjTaJRz0&t=262) Palm 2 is the latest step in our&nbsp; decade-long journey to bring AI&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1UvUjTaJRz0&t=266) in responsible ways to billions of people. It builds on progress made by two world-class&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1UvUjTaJRz0&t=272) teams, the Brain team and DeepMind. Looking back at the defining AI&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1UvUjTaJRz0&t=277) breakthroughs over the last decade, these teams&nbsp; have contributed to a significant number of them.&nbsp;

- [00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1UvUjTaJRz0&t=282) AlphaGo, transformers,&nbsp; sequence-to-sequence models, and so on.&nbsp;

- [00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1UvUjTaJRz0&t=288) All this helps set the stage for the&nbsp; inflection point we are at today.&nbsp;

- [00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1UvUjTaJRz0&t=292) We recently brought these two teams&nbsp; together into a single unit Google DeepMind.&nbsp;

- [00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1UvUjTaJRz0&t=298) Using the computational resources of Google,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1UvUjTaJRz0&t=301) they have focused on building more&nbsp; capable systems safely and responsibly.&nbsp;

- [00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1UvUjTaJRz0&t=307) This includes our next generation foundation&nbsp; model, Gemini, which is still in training.&nbsp;

- [00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1UvUjTaJRz0&t=313) Gemini was created from the&nbsp; ground up to be multimodal,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1UvUjTaJRz0&t=318) highly efficient at tool and API integrations, and built to enable future innovations like&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1UvUjTaJRz0&t=325) memory and planning. While still early,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1UvUjTaJRz0&t=328) we are already seeing impressive multimodal&nbsp; capabilities not seen in prior models.&nbsp;

- [00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1UvUjTaJRz0&t=334) Once fine-tuned and rigorously tested for&nbsp; safety, Gemini will be available at various&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1UvUjTaJRz0&t=340) sizes and capabilities, just like Palm2. As we invest in more advanced models,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1UvUjTaJRz0&t=347) we are also deeply investing in AI responsibility. This includes having the tools to identify&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1UvUjTaJRz0&t=354) synthetically generated content&nbsp; whenever you encounter it.&nbsp;

- [00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1UvUjTaJRz0&t=359) Two important approaches are&nbsp; watermarking and metadata.&nbsp;

- [00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1UvUjTaJRz0&t=364) Watermarking embeds information directly&nbsp; into content in ways that are maintained&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1UvUjTaJRz0&t=370) even through modest image editing. Moving forward, we are building our&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1UvUjTaJRz0&t=375) models to include watermarking and&nbsp; other techniques from the start.&nbsp;

- [00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1UvUjTaJRz0&t=381) If you look at the synthetic image, it's&nbsp; impressive how real it looks, so you can imagine&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1UvUjTaJRz0&t=386) how important this is going to be in the future. Metadata allows content creators to associate&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1UvUjTaJRz0&t=393) additional context with original files, giving you&nbsp; more information whenever you encounter an image.&nbsp;

- [00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1UvUjTaJRz0&t=401) We'll ensure every one of our&nbsp; AI-generated images has that metadata.&nbsp;

- [00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1UvUjTaJRz0&t=407) James will talk about our&nbsp; responsible approach to AI later.&nbsp;

- [00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1UvUjTaJRz0&t=413) As models get better and more capable,&nbsp; one of the most exciting opportunities&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1UvUjTaJRz0&t=419) is making them available for&nbsp; people to engage with directly.&nbsp;

- [00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1UvUjTaJRz0&t=424) That's the opportunity we have at Bard,&nbsp; our experiment for conversational AI.&nbsp;

- [00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1UvUjTaJRz0&t=430) We are a rapidly evolving board. It now supports a wide range of&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1UvUjTaJRz0&t=434) programming capabilities, and it's gotten&nbsp; much smarter at reasoning and math problems.&nbsp;

- [00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1UvUjTaJRz0&t=441) And as of today, it is now&nbsp; fully running on Palm 2.&nbsp;

- [00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1UvUjTaJRz0&t=446) To share more about what's coming,&nbsp; let me turn it over to Sissy.
