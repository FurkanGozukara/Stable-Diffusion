- [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLNQkwW_Q8M&t=0) Greetings everyone. Today I am going to show you&nbsp; 3 famous Qwen image edit LoRAs that you have been&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLNQkwW_Q8M&t=6) hearing of. For example, we have this image.&nbsp; First, I will show how to remove its background&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLNQkwW_Q8M&t=12) with highest quality; we have a tool for that.&nbsp; Then you have this background, and you just copy&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLNQkwW_Q8M&t=19) paste it like this with the size like this. It&nbsp; is just a copy paste. Then with this Qwen image&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLNQkwW_Q8M&t=26) fusion LoRA, you will be able to fuse image into&nbsp; scene like this, any image. It can be a product,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLNQkwW_Q8M&t=33) it can be something else. The 2nd LoRA that I&nbsp; am going to show you is Qwen image relight. So&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLNQkwW_Q8M&t=41) we have this base image, you see, this is&nbsp; its natural lighting, and you will be able&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLNQkwW_Q8M&t=47) to relight it into any lighting as you wish. It&nbsp; can be product, it can be item, it can be person,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLNQkwW_Q8M&t=54) whatever you like. The 3rd famous LoRA is the&nbsp; angle changing, camera angle changing LoRA. So&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLNQkwW_Q8M&t=60) we will give our input image like this, and we&nbsp; will be able to get different angle outputs like&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLNQkwW_Q8M&t=68) this as we wish. You can do this for person,&nbsp; for items, for products, whichever you want.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLNQkwW_Q8M&t=74) I am going to show you all of them how to do in&nbsp; SwarmUI with the easiest way with our presets.

- [00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLNQkwW_Q8M&t=80) So as in our previous tutorials, download&nbsp; our latest SwarmUI model downloader zip&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLNQkwW_Q8M&t=86) file. The link will be in the description of the&nbsp; video. Put it into your SwarmUI installation and&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLNQkwW_Q8M&t=92) extract it and overwrite all the files like I am&nbsp; doing. Then start Windows start download models&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLNQkwW_Q8M&t=99) app file like this, run. Then in the SwarmUI&nbsp; bundles, you will see there are 3 new LoRAs:&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLNQkwW_Q8M&t=107) Qwen image edit multiple angles LoRA, Qwen image&nbsp; edit relight LoRA, and Qwen image edit fusion&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLNQkwW_Q8M&t=114) LoRA. You can just download the image downloading&nbsp; bundle from here, or you can download Qwen image&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLNQkwW_Q8M&t=120) core bundle from here, or you can manually&nbsp; download each 1 of them. They are positioned&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLNQkwW_Q8M&t=126) under the image generation models, Qwen image&nbsp; editing models, and in here you will see we have&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLNQkwW_Q8M&t=132) Qwen image relight LoRA, fusion LoRA, and multiple&nbsp; angles LoRA. Moreover, we have a search feature.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLNQkwW_Q8M&t=139) So let's collapse all SwarmUI bundles and copy the&nbsp; name like relight LoRA, paste it into search bar,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLNQkwW_Q8M&t=148) and you will get directly the LoRA link like&nbsp; this. So click download. Multiple angles LoRA,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLNQkwW_Q8M&t=155) search, you see here, click download. And&nbsp; fusion LoRA, search, and click download.

- [00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLNQkwW_Q8M&t=162) As a next step, you need to have new presets.&nbsp; So as usual, you can import presets from choose&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLNQkwW_Q8M&t=168) file and overwrite, or you can use our&nbsp; Windows preset delete import. This will&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLNQkwW_Q8M&t=175) backup your existing presets and delete all&nbsp; of them and import and add the new presets.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLNQkwW_Q8M&t=181) You need to have SwarmUI running for this&nbsp; to work. So it will ask you, click yes,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLNQkwW_Q8M&t=187) and it is done. Then refresh your presets, sort&nbsp; by name, and you will have the latest presets.

- [00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLNQkwW_Q8M&t=193) So let's begin with the 1st fusion LoRA. I will&nbsp; first refresh my page, reset params to default,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLNQkwW_Q8M&t=200) this is important. Then I am going to use this&nbsp; preset: Qwen image edit plus 12 steps. This is for&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLNQkwW_Q8M&t=206) Qwen image editing models editing tasks. Direct&nbsp; apply. And in addition to this preset, I need to&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLNQkwW_Q8M&t=214) select Qwen fusion LoRA. You see, this is the Qwen&nbsp; fusion LoRA. I select it like this. Now this LoRA&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLNQkwW_Q8M&t=220) has a description that you need to follow. Click&nbsp; here, edit metadata, and in the bottom you will&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLNQkwW_Q8M&t=226) see that there is description prompt. So copy&nbsp; this prompt. So you can copy this entirely,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLNQkwW_Q8M&t=233) paste it into any text file, and copy the prompt&nbsp; from here. This is the prompt they trained this&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLNQkwW_Q8M&t=240) LoRA. Then for fusion, you need to have 2 images&nbsp; that you want to fuse, and you need to remove&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLNQkwW_Q8M&t=247) background. For removing the background, we have&nbsp; BiRefNet HR high resolution background remover.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLNQkwW_Q8M&t=255) This application is the most powerful background&nbsp; removing application. I have recently updated it.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLNQkwW_Q8M&t=262) Download its latest zip file, paste it into any&nbsp; disk wherever you want, extract. Then Windows&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLNQkwW_Q8M&t=270) install or update and run. This model is really,&nbsp; really powerful. This will automatically install.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLNQkwW_Q8M&t=276) It is same as in our other applications; we have&nbsp; RunPod and MassedCompute installers as well.

- [00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLNQkwW_Q8M&t=282) So if you didn't watch our previous&nbsp; SwarmUI and ComfyUI backend tutorials,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLNQkwW_Q8M&t=287) this is the tutorial that you need to watch.&nbsp; This will show you how to install SwarmUI and&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLNQkwW_Q8M&t=292) ComfyUI as a backend and use it with our&nbsp; presets with image generation. And this&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLNQkwW_Q8M&t=298) tutorial is for RunPod and MassedCompute&nbsp; if you don't have a powerful GPU. You can&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLNQkwW_Q8M&t=302) watch this tutorial to learn how to install&nbsp; SwarmUI and ComfyUI and use. So this is for&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLNQkwW_Q8M&t=307) Windows and this is for cloud. They are&nbsp; fully up to date, very recent videos.

- [00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLNQkwW_Q8M&t=312) For removing backgrounds, of course you can&nbsp; use other applications as well, but I am&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLNQkwW_Q8M&t=318) preferring BiRefNet HR because this is the most&nbsp; powerful background remover I have seen. So the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLNQkwW_Q8M&t=324) installation has been completed. You can scroll&nbsp; up and quickly check the logs. Our installers,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLNQkwW_Q8M&t=331) all of them supports RTX 5000 series as&nbsp; well or the cloud GPUs like H100, B200,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLNQkwW_Q8M&t=338) RTX 6000 Pro on Windows and Linux, both of them.&nbsp; So after installation, start the application like&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLNQkwW_Q8M&t=345) this. This application uses VRAM directly&nbsp; related to your input image resolution. So&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLNQkwW_Q8M&t=352) as your input image resolution is bigger, it&nbsp; will use more VRAM. So to upload your image,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLNQkwW_Q8M&t=358) click here and select your image. Then&nbsp; there are resolution presets as you can&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLNQkwW_Q8M&t=363) see. You may be wondering which 1 is&nbsp; best. So you can compare each case.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLNQkwW_Q8M&t=369) Default is 2048 to 2048. Depending on your input&nbsp; image resolution, it will use more VRAM or not,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLNQkwW_Q8M&t=378) and it will impact the output slightly. I have a&nbsp; comparison link here. You can see the comparison&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLNQkwW_Q8M&t=387) of different input images. For example, this is&nbsp; input image, this is the original size remove.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLNQkwW_Q8M&t=393) So you can see like this, original size remove&nbsp; doesn't change the input image resolution when&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLNQkwW_Q8M&t=399) processing. Or we have 2048 to 2048 resolution&nbsp; like this. So which 1 is better? I think the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLNQkwW_Q8M&t=408) original is a little bit better perhaps. I don't&nbsp; know, it depends on each image, so you can try.

- [00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLNQkwW_Q8M&t=415) Okay, I got error with 4000 pixels for this&nbsp; image. This image was really big. Let's see&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLNQkwW_Q8M&t=422) if I am using a lot of VRAM right now. So let's&nbsp; try with 2048 pixels, process image. If you get&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLNQkwW_Q8M&t=429) out of VRAM error like this, you should&nbsp; reduce the resolution of your input image&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLNQkwW_Q8M&t=436) or the processing resolution and pay attention&nbsp; to your VRAM usage. If it uses the shared VRAM,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLNQkwW_Q8M&t=442) it will be really slow. By the way, since I have&nbsp; had out of VRAM error, I need to restart the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLNQkwW_Q8M&t=449) application so it will clear the VRAM. Yes, it is&nbsp; now cleared. Okay, I don't need to change... oh,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLNQkwW_Q8M&t=455) it already had worked actually. So you see this&nbsp; was our input image. You can see it perfectly&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLNQkwW_Q8M&t=462) removes the background. Now I have my background&nbsp; removed image and I have another image where I&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLNQkwW_Q8M&t=470) want to merge it. So let's copy this image and I&nbsp; am using Paint.net, this is a free tool. Add a new&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLNQkwW_Q8M&t=479) layer like this and paste it. So then I will&nbsp; resize it like this based on the resolution that&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLNQkwW_Q8M&t=486) I want to put it, based on the, you know, the&nbsp; related aspect ratio or the related resolution&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLNQkwW_Q8M&t=494) like this or the size we can say. Then I am going&nbsp; to merge this. Then I will save as to use. Let's&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLNQkwW_Q8M&t=502) save it into our downloads folder wherever you&nbsp; want and maximum quality. So this resolution is&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLNQkwW_Q8M&t=508) really big. The Qwen image edit models doesn't&nbsp; support this big resolution, but you can try.

- [00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLNQkwW_Q8M&t=515) First of all, you need to use this plus&nbsp; icon to upload prompt image. This is how&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLNQkwW_Q8M&t=520) Qwen image models works if you remember.&nbsp; Then to get the accurate aspect ratio,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLNQkwW_Q8M&t=525) I am going to use a simple trick. So choose image,&nbsp; download, resolution use closest aspect ratio,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLNQkwW_Q8M&t=532) and it is done. Then I will do something else&nbsp; as well. You see there is smart image prompt&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLNQkwW_Q8M&t=538) resizing. You should compare results with this&nbsp; is on and off because this makes impact. So let's&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLNQkwW_Q8M&t=544) generate 4 images because you should generate&nbsp; multiple images to see the actual quality. And&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLNQkwW_Q8M&t=551) it is generating right now. This will be fairly&nbsp; fast because this preset is only 12 steps. Okay,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLNQkwW_Q8M&t=558) you see it is generating right now. It is fully&nbsp; utilizing my GPU, this is great. And if you don't&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLNQkwW_Q8M&t=564) have a powerful GPU, it will automatically do&nbsp; block swapping and it will still work. This is&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLNQkwW_Q8M&t=569) the beauty of SwarmUI which uses the ComfyUI as a&nbsp; backend. And you see we are fully supporting sage&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLNQkwW_Q8M&t=575) attention as well on all GPUs. And we are also&nbsp; using the Qwen image edit plus FP8 scaled version.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLNQkwW_Q8M&t=582) I have prepared everything fully optimized for&nbsp; you guys. And we have our images. You see it has&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLNQkwW_Q8M&t=588) fused image into it pretty accurately with shadows&nbsp; and everything. It is looking much more natural.

- [00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLNQkwW_Q8M&t=596) Then for example, let's reuse parameters of this&nbsp; image and I am going to upload prompt image again&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLNQkwW_Q8M&t=604) because it is gone like this. And I am going to&nbsp; change this. Let's see what happens. As I said,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLNQkwW_Q8M&t=610) you should try and see if it makes&nbsp; difference, if it improves or not.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLNQkwW_Q8M&t=614) This smart image prompt resizing changes&nbsp; the scale of the input image according to&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLNQkwW_Q8M&t=620) the Qwen image edit model. You see it says&nbsp; it is almost always best to leave this on,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLNQkwW_Q8M&t=625) but in some cases if you are setting your&nbsp; resolution accurately, you may turn it off. Okay,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLNQkwW_Q8M&t=630) so this is another image. Let's make a&nbsp; comparison. This to this. I don't know,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLNQkwW_Q8M&t=635) both is looking really good. So it is up to you,&nbsp; you can test it and see. So this was the 1st case.

- [00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLNQkwW_Q8M&t=641) Now the next case. Let's refresh this page,&nbsp; reset params to default to not make any mistakes.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLNQkwW_Q8M&t=647) Presets. Again I am going to use this Qwen image&nbsp; edit plus preset. Then the next LoRA that I am&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLNQkwW_Q8M&t=654) going to show you is relight. So I am selecting&nbsp; this relight LoRA. And when I edit metadata and&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLNQkwW_Q8M&t=662) copy its description and paste it here, you see&nbsp; this is the prompt. So we are going to use this&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLNQkwW_Q8M&t=667) trigger word and paste it. Then we will select&nbsp; our relight LoRA image from here as usual. You&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLNQkwW_Q8M&t=674) can also drag and drop, let me show you. For&nbsp; example this image. And you see now it is image&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLNQkwW_Q8M&t=680) prompting. Then let's generate 4 images. This&nbsp; is going to relight it into sunlight. Again you&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLNQkwW_Q8M&t=686) need to set resolution accordingly to keep the&nbsp; aspect ratio accurately. So I will init image&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLNQkwW_Q8M&t=693) and I will select the image from here. I will&nbsp; say use closest aspect ratio. Then you turn&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLNQkwW_Q8M&t=699) this off. If you don't turn this off, it will&nbsp; not work. So this is init image, this is image&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLNQkwW_Q8M&t=705) prompting. They are totally different. And&nbsp; generate. Now let's see the results. Again&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLNQkwW_Q8M&t=710) we are using 12 steps. This resolution is like&nbsp; 2 megapixels, so it is fairly fast. Okay it is&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLNQkwW_Q8M&t=717) generating right now. This is the VRAM usage,&nbsp; but don't worry about VRAM usages. It works as&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLNQkwW_Q8M&t=723) low as 6 gigabyte GPUs if you have sufficient&nbsp; amount of RAM memory. Even if you don't have,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLNQkwW_Q8M&t=729) it will work but it will be slow. And here it&nbsp; is relighted into sunlight. Very good. I mean&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLNQkwW_Q8M&t=735) from this input image, you see, this was a very&nbsp; big image, to this image. So you can play with&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLNQkwW_Q8M&t=742) it. You can even try higher resolution and see&nbsp; if it is working. If you use higher resolution,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLNQkwW_Q8M&t=747) of course it will use more VRAM, it will&nbsp; take more time. It is up to you, but try it.

- [00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLNQkwW_Q8M&t=753) The 3rd case is, let's refresh, reset&nbsp; params to default and select our preset&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLNQkwW_Q8M&t=759) 1 more time. We are all using this Qwen image&nbsp; edit preset and hopefully Qwen image 2511 is&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLNQkwW_Q8M&t=767) coming which will be an upgrade and I will&nbsp; upgrade it as soon as arrived hopefully.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLNQkwW_Q8M&t=771) The next LoRA is multiple angles LoRA. And&nbsp; again edit metadata, copy the description to&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLNQkwW_Q8M&t=779) have the prompt. So there are some example&nbsp; prompts like move the camera front, left,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLNQkwW_Q8M&t=784) right. Let's see the turn the camera to a top down&nbsp; view and copy paste it here. Again we are going to&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLNQkwW_Q8M&t=792) use an prompt image. So let's use this 1. Again&nbsp; you need to have accurate aspect ratio. This is&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLNQkwW_Q8M&t=798) very close to 16 by 9 so since I know its aspect&nbsp; ratio I can make it like this and 4. But you know&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLNQkwW_Q8M&t=807) the strategy right now. And let's see the result.&nbsp; I have spent huge time to prepare these presets,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLNQkwW_Q8M&t=813) edit these LoRAs, add accurate information, add to&nbsp; our downloader. All of these are taking huge time.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLNQkwW_Q8M&t=820) And furthermore I am right now working on updated&nbsp; Flux configurations. You will love them. We have&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLNQkwW_Q8M&t=828) got huge amount of improvements. Let me show you.&nbsp; So our new configurations will be shared and let&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLNQkwW_Q8M&t=836) me show you the new speeds. We have got huge&nbsp; speed up. We have added torch compile. This was&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLNQkwW_Q8M&t=843) not available in SD scripts. Now I am improving&nbsp; it. I have my own copy so we are now using both&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLNQkwW_Q8M&t=850) SD scripts and Kohya GUI developed by me. So we&nbsp; have torch compile. It is working great. It is&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLNQkwW_Q8M&t=857) working even great with multiple GPU now. So you&nbsp; can get up to 4x speed up with 4 GPUs if you use.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLNQkwW_Q8M&t=866) This is for Dreambooth fine tuning. And we have&nbsp; new LoRA configs and when you open that you will&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLNQkwW_Q8M&t=872) see. And when we see its speeds it is like this.&nbsp; This is great speed. Again 4x GPU is working. So&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLNQkwW_Q8M&t=880) hopefully I will make a quick tutorial for it&nbsp; as well. And you can watch our older tutorials,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLNQkwW_Q8M&t=885) so search in our channel like this and you&nbsp; see you can watch this tutorial to use our&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLNQkwW_Q8M&t=890) newest presets. But I will show quickly as well&nbsp; in a newer tutorial. Still you should watch it.

- [00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLNQkwW_Q8M&t=896) Okay we got our new angle. So this is a top&nbsp; down view angle generations it has made based&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLNQkwW_Q8M&t=903) on our input image. So this was our input image&nbsp; and based on this input image we have got top&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLNQkwW_Q8M&t=910) down views. So you can again use this on humans,&nbsp; animals, items, products, whichever you want. It&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLNQkwW_Q8M&t=917) should work fairly well. This was the LoRA that&nbsp; you have been seeing on the social media, Reddit,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLNQkwW_Q8M&t=924) about the multiple angles LoRA. So these 3 LoRAs&nbsp; are the newest Qwen image edit LoRAs that you have&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLNQkwW_Q8M&t=932) been hearing on. I hope you have enjoyed.&nbsp; You can ask me any questions from Patreon,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLNQkwW_Q8M&t=938) from YouTube, from Discord. Hopefully see&nbsp; you in another amazing tutorial video.
