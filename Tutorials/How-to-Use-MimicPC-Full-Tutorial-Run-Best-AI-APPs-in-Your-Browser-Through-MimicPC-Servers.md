### Video Transcription


- [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URnOHbmuKWs&t=0) Greetings everyone. Today I am going&nbsp; to introduce you to MimicPC. MimicPC&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URnOHbmuKWs&t=5) is a cloud service that lets you use AI&nbsp; applications seamlessly in your browser,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URnOHbmuKWs&t=12) while everything runs on remote cloud servers,&nbsp; providing permanent storage as well. So,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URnOHbmuKWs&t=19) I have prepared this post where you will find&nbsp; relevant links and explanations. This is a&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URnOHbmuKWs&t=25) public post. The link of the post will be in the&nbsp; description of the video. So, how are you going&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URnOHbmuKWs&t=30) to register? Open this link. Then you can either&nbsp; register by email or using your Google account,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URnOHbmuKWs&t=37) which I am going to use my Google account.&nbsp; Continue with Google. I will use my email.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URnOHbmuKWs&t=42) Continue. When you register first time, they will&nbsp; give you 50 cents. You can set a password to login&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URnOHbmuKWs&t=50) also, if you wish. I am just going to skip it&nbsp; because I have used the Google account. And on&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URnOHbmuKWs&t=54) this screen you will see that I have balance. I&nbsp; can add balance from add funds from here. Also,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URnOHbmuKWs&t=60) you will see that they are giving us&nbsp; 50 gigabytes storage here. You see,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URnOHbmuKWs&t=65) this is a permanent storage. Whatever the file I&nbsp; upload, my models, my generated images, my videos,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URnOHbmuKWs&t=71) whatever, they will be permanently saved. And when&nbsp; I am using next time, they will be there. Also,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URnOHbmuKWs&t=77) I will be able to access my files without spending&nbsp; any money, without starting any service. This&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URnOHbmuKWs&t=84) is a very, very good deal. They are giving 50&nbsp; gigabytes. And you can also upgrade the storage&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URnOHbmuKWs&t=90) if you need. You see, you can upgrade it to 150&nbsp; gigabytes, 250, and so on. This is a very cool&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URnOHbmuKWs&t=96) feature. So, this is the main screen. You can go&nbsp; to the add new app and select the existing apps&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URnOHbmuKWs&t=103) from here. You see Automatic1111 web UI, Fooocus.&nbsp; Then there is RVC. You can also search here,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URnOHbmuKWs&t=110) like Whisper. Let's search it. Okay, looks like&nbsp; the search is not working very well. There is&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URnOHbmuKWs&t=115) ComfyUI. You can install ComfyUI, load&nbsp; your workflows and use them. You can use Face&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URnOHbmuKWs&t=121) Fusion, Chatbot, AI Toolkit, and ChatTTS and&nbsp; others. They are keep adding new applications&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URnOHbmuKWs&t=129) to here. Moreover, they have a Discord server.&nbsp; When you join their Discord server from this link,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URnOHbmuKWs&t=135) you will get into this page. And in this page,&nbsp; there are free workflows. So, you can use the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URnOHbmuKWs&t=141) free workflows of other people. You can chat with&nbsp; the developers. Ask your questions and anything.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URnOHbmuKWs&t=147) This is very, very useful. So, let's continue.&nbsp; I am going to show a few applications in this&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URnOHbmuKWs&t=153) tutorial. First of all, the CogVideoX-Fun. This&nbsp; is the latest open source. The very best open&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URnOHbmuKWs&t=160) source image to video model. So, how you are&nbsp; going to start it. There is a quick link here.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URnOHbmuKWs&t=165) This is a shared workflow. You can also share&nbsp; your workflows. I will click apply from here,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URnOHbmuKWs&t=171) and I am logged into my account. Then it will ask&nbsp; me to select a GPU. There are several tier GPUs,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URnOHbmuKWs&t=179) as you are seeing right now. Medium, large, large&nbsp; pro, ultra, and mini. Based on the workflow that&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URnOHbmuKWs&t=185) you are going to use. You need to select accurate&nbsp; hardware. Since CogVideoX is extremely hardware&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URnOHbmuKWs&t=191) demanding. I am going to use ultra. Ultra&nbsp; gives me L40s, 48 gigabyte GPU. This is a very,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URnOHbmuKWs&t=197) very powerful GPU. Then you can set your machine stop after certain minutes. You can set automatic&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URnOHbmuKWs&t=204) extension. This is very useful if you forget to&nbsp; turn off your machine, it will be automatically stopped.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URnOHbmuKWs&t=209) You see, there is automatic stop as well. So,&nbsp; let's click the create and start. It will start&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URnOHbmuKWs&t=214) the machine. This is going to auto load models&nbsp; from their system since this is a shared workflow,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URnOHbmuKWs&t=221) and in the right panel you see my files are here.&nbsp; All of the files that I have used will be saved&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URnOHbmuKWs&t=227) here entirely, and I will be able to access&nbsp; them. So, let's return back to our dashboard,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URnOHbmuKWs&t=233) and this is the newest machine that, it is getting&nbsp; started. So, we are waiting. I suggest you to&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URnOHbmuKWs&t=240) name them to not forget them. So, click this&nbsp; icon and let's give CogVideoX fun model. So,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URnOHbmuKWs&t=247) you should name them to remember them later. And&nbsp; if you want to access their files, you see there&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URnOHbmuKWs&t=253) is go to manage, when you go to manage, you will&nbsp; see all of your files here without starting them.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URnOHbmuKWs&t=258) Let me show you. For example, in this machine,&nbsp; I have generated some videos. Go to manage. This&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URnOHbmuKWs&t=263) machine is not started, so I am not using any of&nbsp; my credits. And in the output. In the right panel,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URnOHbmuKWs&t=269) you see the videos that I have generated. For&nbsp; example, I can download this video and show you&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URnOHbmuKWs&t=275) that I have generated. Let's start it. You see,&nbsp; this was animated video from a static image,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URnOHbmuKWs&t=281) so I can access all of my files from here. I can&nbsp; upload models according to my needs. You see,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URnOHbmuKWs&t=288) there is upload icon here. So, go to the models&nbsp; and click upload. You can also download models&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URnOHbmuKWs&t=294) from remote servers. So, when I click here. It&nbsp; will allow me to choose either from my computer&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URnOHbmuKWs&t=300) or upload from URL. Like, you can upload&nbsp; from HuggingFace repository, from CivitAI,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URnOHbmuKWs&t=307) or similar FTP supporting servers with direct&nbsp; URLs. And my machine has started. You see,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URnOHbmuKWs&t=314) I click operate and this is the CogVideoX fan&nbsp; model. This is using the ComfyUI as a backend. So,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URnOHbmuKWs&t=323) you don't need to do anything actually. Okay.&nbsp; Looks like this link has been changed to&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URnOHbmuKWs&t=329) something else. It says FLUX model, which is&nbsp; not supposed to happen. See, I will fix this&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URnOHbmuKWs&t=335) link. Yes, this is CogVideoX. Maybe I started the&nbsp; inaccurate one. Let's start this one. Apply. And&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URnOHbmuKWs&t=341) let's select the hardware as Ultra. Create and&nbsp; start. Maybe I clicked the inaccurate link. I'm&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URnOHbmuKWs&t=347) not sure. Okay. Now it's starting. Return back to&nbsp; our session. So, this is getting started. This was&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URnOHbmuKWs&t=354) FLUX. Don't worry. I will fix this link if it is not&nbsp; the CogVideoX model. Okay. This time we got the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URnOHbmuKWs&t=360) accurate model. So, also I am going to share this&nbsp; another machine with you, and I am going to show&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URnOHbmuKWs&t=366) you how to share. You see, there is share option.&nbsp; Let's click this, and I will say create image. So,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URnOHbmuKWs&t=372) this way I will be able to share my image with&nbsp; you, and you will be able to use it. Let's&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URnOHbmuKWs&t=379) name this as FLUX. Okay. You can also add image&nbsp; description. I will just save. And then I will&nbsp;

- [00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URnOHbmuKWs&t=386) have this link, and I am going to add it here, so&nbsp; you can also access it quickly. Let's add it here.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URnOHbmuKWs&t=392) So, now when you open this link that I have&nbsp; shared, you will be able to use the workflow&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URnOHbmuKWs&t=398) that I have. And where was it? Let's go back to&nbsp; our operate. It was here. Let's see. And yes,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URnOHbmuKWs&t=405) for example, this is using FLUX model right&nbsp; now. You can also use all other models that&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URnOHbmuKWs&t=411) are shared in their system. So, this is how their&nbsp; system works. This is just amazing. For example,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URnOHbmuKWs&t=417) let's use this FP8 model and generate an image,&nbsp; and let's return back to our video model. So,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URnOHbmuKWs&t=424) this is the CogVideoX model. Let's upload an&nbsp; image. So, I'm going to animate this image as&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URnOHbmuKWs&t=430) an example, and how you need to prompt. This&nbsp; is still in research. I am also not sure how&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URnOHbmuKWs&t=438) exactly to prompt. I have made some testing, and&nbsp; I have prepared a quick prompt for you. You see,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URnOHbmuKWs&t=444) you can use POE and Claude 3.5 or ChatGPT or&nbsp; Gemini to generate a caption. I have written&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URnOHbmuKWs&t=452) a quick prompt here. So, let's write the prompt&nbsp; here. This is a free version that is allowing you&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URnOHbmuKWs&t=459) to use, free. Upload your image from your computer&nbsp; and get a caption. However, as I said, not all of&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URnOHbmuKWs&t=467) the descriptions that it generates works. So, this&nbsp; is somewhat you need to get experience. I am still&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URnOHbmuKWs&t=473) not sure. So, let's copy this one. Let's return&nbsp; back and paste your prompt here. That is all you&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URnOHbmuKWs&t=479) need to do. Then click Queue prompt. It will load the&nbsp; model and generate a video from this. And when we&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URnOHbmuKWs&t=486) return back to our ComfyUI workflow with FLUX. It&nbsp; generated the image. However, it is broken because&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URnOHbmuKWs&t=493) FLUX model doesn't work like this. You need to&nbsp; set the CFG 1 and we need to set the resolution&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URnOHbmuKWs&t=499) to like 1024 to let's see 1024, 1024. Actually, I will&nbsp; update my image so it can be like this. Then&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URnOHbmuKWs&t=510) as a sampler, I find that iPNDM is working&nbsp; best. So, let's generate another image. Now it&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URnOHbmuKWs&t=517) should be accurate. You see, the speed is really,&nbsp; really good. This is running on a cloud machine,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URnOHbmuKWs&t=522) not on my computer, and image is generated.&nbsp; Now I am going to share this. Actually see,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URnOHbmuKWs&t=529) you do not have enough storage to share. Okay,&nbsp; I need to expand my storage. So how I can expand&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URnOHbmuKWs&t=535) my storage. I'm going to delete some of the&nbsp; applications that I have. So, when I delete them,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URnOHbmuKWs&t=540) they will empty my storage. Delete, delete, and&nbsp; it's also delete this one for now. Okay, I have&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URnOHbmuKWs&t=547) got more storage as I delete other ones. They&nbsp; will be also fixed. Okay. And this was another&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URnOHbmuKWs&t=555) one started. So, let's see which ones are, which&nbsp; ones so let's delete this one. Okay. It's okay.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URnOHbmuKWs&t=562) Ok this is gone. Accurate image. Return back to&nbsp; this one. This is also accurate one. It is working&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URnOHbmuKWs&t=568) fine. So, I want to share this workflow with you&nbsp; as a FLUX development model. FP8. You can also use&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URnOHbmuKWs&t=575) this on less powerful hardwares, cheaper ones.&nbsp; So, I am going to share this as an image. Yes,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URnOHbmuKWs&t=582) not important. FLUX dev. Okay, save and share.&nbsp; Okay, I can share indefinitely. Create sharing,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URnOHbmuKWs&t=590) copy. That's it. And now once you click this new app,&nbsp; it should work. So, this is how you can share&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URnOHbmuKWs&t=598) applications. You also don't need to use&nbsp; mine, why? Because, as I said, official&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URnOHbmuKWs&t=604) applications already have them. For example,&nbsp; let's also make example of Automatic1111 web UI,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URnOHbmuKWs&t=609) and this can run pretty much on every hardware.&nbsp; For example, let's start with this T4. Create&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URnOHbmuKWs&t=616) and start Auto1111 web UI. We should also&nbsp; name it as Auto1111 web UI. Okay, actually&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URnOHbmuKWs&t=622) it shows that the name. Then let's create another&nbsp; application as new application and Fooocus for&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URnOHbmuKWs&t=628) example. You can also use Whisper. Actually let's&nbsp; also make a Whisper example. Get started. Create.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URnOHbmuKWs&t=635) Whisper also runs on all of the hardware, and&nbsp; let's also make another one as Fooocus. You see&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URnOHbmuKWs&t=641) the logic is same. You can also upload your&nbsp; models, your configurations, everything works,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URnOHbmuKWs&t=647) everything is saved in your permanent storage.&nbsp; They give you 50 gigabytes of permanent storage&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URnOHbmuKWs&t=653) every month, as I said, for free. And this was our&nbsp; FLUX model. Until you stop your running instance,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URnOHbmuKWs&t=660) it will use your credits, but once you stop it,&nbsp; it will give back your credits. So, when you&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URnOHbmuKWs&t=666) first time started, it will deduct your credits&nbsp; from your account, but when you stop it back, it&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URnOHbmuKWs&t=672) will return back the remaining time. So, what does&nbsp; this mean? Let me show you. Let's refresh. I have&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URnOHbmuKWs&t=677) currently around 9 dollars. So, when I stopped&nbsp; this one, it should return back to my credits. So,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URnOHbmuKWs&t=684) you see, my credits are returned back. This is how&nbsp; their system works. And on this page, you see home,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URnOHbmuKWs&t=691) mini PC dashboard, it shows which instances&nbsp; are running right now. So, I have CogVideoX,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URnOHbmuKWs&t=698) Automatic1111 web UI, Whisper web UI, and Fooocus.&nbsp; Let's close all of them because we can reconnect&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URnOHbmuKWs&t=704) them. Actually, this is working. So, let's just&nbsp; keep it as it is. Close all other ones. And for&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URnOHbmuKWs&t=710) example, let's go to the this one. Auto1111 Web UI. Starting. So it is started.

- [00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URnOHbmuKWs&t=715) So in here I can use all these models. You see they are all added here. This is just amazing.

- [00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URnOHbmuKWs&t=721) You can select any model and use directly.

- [00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URnOHbmuKWs&t=723) For example lets select one of the models from here. For example ColorFull XL V6.

- [00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URnOHbmuKWs&t=729) You can also use your own models, CivitAI models Hugging Face models, how you can use?

- [00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URnOHbmuKWs&t=738) I am going to show example from Hugging Face. For example RealVis XL V5

- [00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URnOHbmuKWs&t=742) and you want to use this model, go to the&nbsp; RealVis XL version 5 fp16. Copy download link&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URnOHbmuKWs&t=749) and go back here and in the models click here,&nbsp; and this goes into the Stable Diffusion folder,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URnOHbmuKWs&t=755) as you know it. Click upload. I am going to upload&nbsp; it from remote server like this. So, you see, this&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URnOHbmuKWs&t=760) is the download URL. Click upload and just wait,&nbsp; it will upload it. Unfortunately, it doesn't show&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URnOHbmuKWs&t=767) the status, so you need to wait the upload to be&nbsp; completed. I think it is going to show in the logs&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URnOHbmuKWs&t=774) or somewhere. Let's see, it doesn't show here. It&nbsp; was showing somewhere. Okay, I think you need to&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URnOHbmuKWs&t=780) click here and just wait until it is completed.&nbsp; So, let's go back to models and close this&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URnOHbmuKWs&t=787) upload icon. Let's go back to Stable Diffusion&nbsp; and refresh. So, you just need to wait until it is&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URnOHbmuKWs&t=793) completed. I told this to the developers. I think&nbsp; they will add it. Currently SDXL Colorful XL is&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URnOHbmuKWs&t=799) loaded, a car. Okay, let's go to a simple thing,&nbsp; a car. Let's select one of the best sampler, UniPC,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URnOHbmuKWs&t=806) and 1024 like this. Let's generate an image. This&nbsp; is SDXL model. It shows that SDXL, and our video&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URnOHbmuKWs&t=814) is still getting generated. Unfortunately, this&nbsp; video model extremely demanding and slow, but I&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URnOHbmuKWs&t=821) think there will be better models soon coming&nbsp; up. So, you can also use them. And I was also&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URnOHbmuKWs&t=827) going to show you LivePortrait video to video for&nbsp; example. Let's go to the video to video. Let's&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URnOHbmuKWs&t=833) open this image, and also there is image to video LivePortrait. Let's also open them.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URnOHbmuKWs&t=839) You just need to click apply. You can use a lesser&nbsp; hardware here, like large pro. Create. And here&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URnOHbmuKWs&t=846) apply. Okay. And let's also do large pro. See, it&nbsp; started. Yes, here. Since I am starting multiple&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URnOHbmuKWs&t=854) things, it may be confusing but when you start one by&nbsp; one you won't get confused. It is just so easy,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URnOHbmuKWs&t=859) and it is getting started. And meanwhile, let's&nbsp; look at the Auto111 web UI. Okay. This&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URnOHbmuKWs&t=865) image is generated with this model and our model&nbsp; arrived here. You see, it was downloaded from the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URnOHbmuKWs&t=870) HuggingFace. So, when I refresh here, I should be&nbsp; able to see it. It is getting, refreshed. Yes. Let's&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URnOHbmuKWs&t=876) type its name and you see RealVis XL arrived.&nbsp; This is permanently saved in my folders right now.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URnOHbmuKWs&t=883) So, it is getting loaded. Just wait until the&nbsp; load completed. This is the same as in Fooocus,&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URnOHbmuKWs&t=890) in ComfyUI. You see, I can connect to the&nbsp; Fooocus, and I can just start using it.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URnOHbmuKWs&t=895) And there is also a Whisper web UI. I can start&nbsp; using it. For example, this is the Fooocus. Let's&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URnOHbmuKWs&t=900) use the advanced. And in here, models, all of&nbsp; the models are also here. However, I also need to&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URnOHbmuKWs&t=907) download the model that I want into here as well.&nbsp; So, currently it is SDXL base, like car. It will&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URnOHbmuKWs&t=913) just start generating. Fooocus. And there is also a&nbsp; Whisper web UI, as you are seeing right now. Just&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URnOHbmuKWs&t=919) select an example video, upload it, and generate&nbsp; subtitle. It will automatically extract the audio&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URnOHbmuKWs&t=925) and generate subtitle. This is Whisper web UI.&nbsp; I'm not going to delve into how to use these&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URnOHbmuKWs&t=931) applications. They are separate applications, but&nbsp; I am just showing you how you can use Mimic PC.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URnOHbmuKWs&t=937) Everything is running on remote server, but I am&nbsp; using as it is on my PC. You see, and it doesn't&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URnOHbmuKWs&t=942) install anything. Because this is running on my&nbsp; browser, nothing is installed into my browser or&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URnOHbmuKWs&t=948) on my computer. All of this is running on a remote&nbsp; cloud server. And the images are getting generated&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URnOHbmuKWs&t=954) in the Fooocus web UI. Okay. So, this is loaded&nbsp; screen of the LivePortrait. For example, this is&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URnOHbmuKWs&t=963) from image to video. Okay. Let's see. Yes. I have&nbsp; demo materials on my computer. So, let's say this&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URnOHbmuKWs&t=969) is the image. Let's load a video like this. This&nbsp; is the latest version of the LivePortrait. So, you&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URnOHbmuKWs&t=975) can change the like, ee, woo, and other things of&nbsp; the image, like here. Let's make it more smiling.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URnOHbmuKWs&t=983) Okay. There is expression editor. Then just let's&nbsp; queue the prompt and let's wait it. And this is&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URnOHbmuKWs&t=989) another LivePortrait. This is only image. Okay.&nbsp; So, you can play with this and see how they are&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URnOHbmuKWs&t=995) working. Let's queue prompt. And the Whispers also&nbsp; generated the transcription. It's pretty fast.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URnOHbmuKWs&t=1001) Okay. This file, this audio, I think. Yes. This&nbsp; is one. Okay. Let's generate subtitle. It should&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URnOHbmuKWs&t=1007) be very fast after first time. Yes. You see, it&nbsp; is almost instant. So, it generated the subtitle.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URnOHbmuKWs&t=1013) You can also download the subtitle from here. Just&nbsp; open it and you see, this is the subtitle. Okay.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URnOHbmuKWs&t=1019) Everything is working. This also generated a GIF&nbsp; image from the uploaded image. You see, like this.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URnOHbmuKWs&t=1025) So, it is like blinking its eye. You see, you can&nbsp; also set another things here. For example, let's&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URnOHbmuKWs&t=1032) set 10 smile or 1.3. Let's&nbsp; queue prompt. This should be pretty fast. Yes.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URnOHbmuKWs&t=1037) Now it is also smiling. Okay. Yeah. Pretty good.&nbsp; You see. Both smiling and blinking. And here the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URnOHbmuKWs&t=1043) original image. And this was expression transfer&nbsp; from video. Okay. Currently it doesn't save the&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URnOHbmuKWs&t=1050) audio. So, you also need to save the audio. How&nbsp; you gonna save it? To save the audio, you just&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URnOHbmuKWs&t=1056) drag and drop the audio and requeue. By the way,&nbsp; everything will be in the output folder. So, you&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URnOHbmuKWs&t=1062) can also download them later. Okay. It is getting&nbsp; generated. And let's look at our image animation.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URnOHbmuKWs&t=1069) Yes. You see, this static image, turned it into&nbsp; this video. Okay. Yeah. It's a very weird video.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URnOHbmuKWs&t=1076) As I said, how you prompt is a mystery right&nbsp; now. People are working on them. But my prompt&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URnOHbmuKWs&t=1083) generation also works decently. It really animated&nbsp; the image into this video. This is a free video.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URnOHbmuKWs&t=1090) You don't wait. You just run it on Mimic PC. You&nbsp; can also run it on your computer if your computer&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URnOHbmuKWs&t=1095) is powerful. And yes. This is the newer video&nbsp; getting generated. Yes. Currently it is combining&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URnOHbmuKWs&t=1101) the video. You can also follow the status on&nbsp; this green line here. Okay. And video generated.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URnOHbmuKWs&t=1109) Refresh. Refresh here to get the video. Yes. The&nbsp; video arrived. I can click here and download.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URnOHbmuKWs&t=1115) Let's play it. It's fresh. And then the other big&nbsp; thing for me is sleeping. I love sleeping. And I&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URnOHbmuKWs&t=1121) need. Okay. As you see, it generated video. You&nbsp; need to play with settings to get better results.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URnOHbmuKWs&t=1128) And this is how you use Mimic PC. I hope you&nbsp; have enjoyed. Please ask any questions. Please&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URnOHbmuKWs&t=1135) join their Discord server and chat with the&nbsp; developers and the experts there. They keep&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URnOHbmuKWs&t=1141) adding new features, new amazing stuff. So, you&nbsp; can use all of the applications and also your own&nbsp;&nbsp;

- [00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URnOHbmuKWs&t=1148) workflows with ComfyUI. It also has a default&nbsp; ComfyUI. So, go to ComfyUI. Go to ComfyUI from&nbsp;&nbsp;
