Introduction to the new PixArt-α (PixArt Alpha) text to image model which is for real better than Stable Diffusion models even from SDXL. PixArt-α is close to the Midjourney level meanwhile being open source and supporting full fine tuning and DreamBooth training. In this tutorial I show how to install and use PixArt-α both locally and on a cloud service RunPod with automatic installers and step by step guidance.

The paper introduces PIXART-α, a Transformer-based text-to-image (T2I) diffusion model designed to significantly lower training costs while maintaining high image generation quality, competitive with leading models like Imagen and Midjourney. It achieves high-resolution synthesis up to 1024x1024 pixels at reduced training costs.

Key Innovations:

Training Strategy Decomposition: The process is divided into three steps focusing on pixel dependency, text-image alignment, and image aesthetic quality. This approach reduces learning costs by starting with a low-cost class-condition model and then pretraining and fine-tuning on data rich in information density and aesthetic quality.

Efficient T2I Transformer: Built on the Diffusion Transformer (DiT) framework, it includes cross-attention modules for text conditions and streamlines computation. A reparameterization technique enables loading parameters from class-condition models, leveraging prior knowledge from ImageNet, thus accelerating training.

High-informative Data: To overcome deficiencies in existing text-image datasets, the paper introduces an auto-labeling pipeline using a vision-language model (LLaVA) to generate captions on the SAM dataset. This dataset is selected for its diverse collection of objects, aiding in creating high-information-density text-image pairs for efficient alignment learning.

Image Quality: The model excels in image quality, artistry, and semantic control, surpassing existing models in user studies and benchmarks.

Broader Implications: The paper suggests that PIXART-α's approach allows individual researchers and startups to develop high-quality T2I models at lower costs, potentially democratizing access to advanced AI-generated content.

The paper concludes with the hope that PIXART-α will inspire the AIGC community and enable more entities to build their own generative models efficiently and affordably.
