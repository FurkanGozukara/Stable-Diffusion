# 19 March 2025 Update V45

- All models are uploaded as zip files that you can download from browser or with any app and extract. After extracting move models folder into your Wan 2.1 installation: https://huggingface.co/OwlMaster/wan21/tree/main
- This is only necessary if your model download fails - which happens rarely
- Model loading and reloading significantly improved after doing huge work on that
- So when you switch between models or generate consequent videos, your RAM shouldn2T get full and cause computer freeze, etc
- New amazing feature Extend Video Factor (1Ã— = No Extension) added
- This feature is still not fully tested yet but you can try
- Click Extension Feature Info to see its info
- This new feature took huge time to make work. There can be still errors as i said please report back
- A new button Apply Fast Preset updated to be more robust
  - Now: Enables Teacache, set Teacache to 0.15, set step counts to 20 and set Sigma Shift to 10
- FP8 causes color changes in some cases, i will research it
- Windows_Update.bat should work, if fails make a fresh install and move models folder
- Hopefully many more features coming soon such as
- Adding 20+ LoRAs to auto download with their trigger word
- Having LoRA trigger word save load system
- Loading LoRAs from prompts

### 19 March 2025 Update V43

- Cancel button will cancel videos now immediately as soon as next step completed (not waiting all steps like before)
- Cancel batch processing button will do the same as above
- I had to modify pipeline myself to add this feature
  - I also made a pull request of this https://github.com/modelscope/DiffSynth-Studio/pull/463
- Prompt enhance button taken to the top after requested
- Windows_Update.bat should be sufficient but if fails make a fresh install and move model files


### 18 March 2025 Update V40

- It was not saving used CFG Scale and Sigma Shift to generated prompt files, now it will be, this error fixed
- A new button Apply Fast Preset added which does the following
- Enables Teacache, set Teacache to 0.15, set step counts to 20 and set Sigma Shift to 10
- I believe these settings are really good + really fast
- I have made a lot of comparisons here I am sharing links below
  - 1: [Simple prompt vs Detailed Prompt](https://www.reddit.com/r/SECourses/comments/1jdo4uu/left_one_is_50_steps_simple_prompt_right_one_is/)
  - 2: [Sigma Shift 6 vs Sigma Shift 10](https://www.reddit.com/r/SECourses/comments/1jdq3js/left_sigma_shift_6_and_right_one_sigma_shift_10/)
  - 3: [CFG 5 vs CFG 6](https://www.reddit.com/r/SECourses/comments/1jdqmgx/wan_21_cfg_5_vs_cfg_6/)
  - 4: [Teacache 0.15 vs 0.20](https://www.reddit.com/r/SECourses/comments/1jdqxog/wan21_teacache_015_vs_020/)
  - 5: [Teacache 0.15 (20 steps) vs 0.20 (20 steps) vs 0.25 (50 steps)](https://www.reddit.com/r/SECourses/comments/1jdrso5/wan21_teacache_015_20_steps_vs_020_20_steps_vs/)
  - 6: [Teacache 0.15 vs 0.25](https://www.reddit.com/r/SECourses/comments/1jdscqn/wan_21_teacache_015_vs_025_50_steps_720x1280_81/)
- Just running Windows updater should be sufficient from previous version


### 16 March 2025 Update V39

- An important bug regarding image to video models fixed
- We were supposed to load following model as FP32 but we were loading as BF16: models_clip_open-clip-xlm-roberta-large-vit-huge-14.pth
- Therefore, image to video models could have produced lower quality in some cases
- Moreover, it was preventing FP8 working on image to video models and now it is working perfect
  - FP8 LoRA fixed as well
- VRAM usage optimized and presets are all updated for the following VRAM GPUs for both FP8 (torch.float8_e4m3fn) and BF16 (torch.bfloat16) weights: 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 16, 24, 48 and 80 GB
- You can see amazing chart regarding this here: https://www.reddit.com/r/SECourses/comments/1jcse0z/wan_21_vram_usages_very_detailed_chart_for_4_8_10/
  - Zip file also has this table image
  - When you change either model, or GPU preset or Dtype (FP8 vs BF16), the app will automatically set Number of Persistent Parameters In Dit (VRAM) for all GPUs and models
- Upgrading from V33: just run Windows_Update.bat
  - If fails, make a fresh install and move models folder
- Now, if you set a static seed like 200 and generate 5 images seeds will be like: 200, 201, 202, 203, 204


### 16 March 2025 Update V35

- New random prompt feature implemented
  - It is working like this <random:x,y,z> will pick randomly x,y,z words
    - .e.g: A <random: green, yellow, red, etc> car
      - A green car
      - A yellow car
      - A red car
    - It will trim the leading and ending space characters
- Auto Scale was not properly working
  - Now when Auto Scale selected it will automatically set target width and height resolution
- When batch processing it was not able to read and process images with accurate orientation in some cases like exif data
  - Now it will work if broken let me know
- Aspect ratio button change and GPU preset change was broken and now fixed
- Upgrading from V32: just run Windows_Update.bat


### 15 March 2025 Update V32

- A lot of errors regarding pipeline fixed and official Teacache arrived
- Now negative prompts load, save should work
  - Your older configs may need re-save / re-make
- New official Teacache brought amazing speed improvement with minimal quality
